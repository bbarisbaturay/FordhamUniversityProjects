0,"February 18, 2020",5,amazing work place great place to work the tech and management is extremely helpful and friendly. everyone seeks to help others succeed and working here has helped me out over and beyond.
1,"November 30, 2021",4,Very laid back and nice culture My team specifically was very calm and chill to work with. If you wanted to work on a specific feature/area they were very open to the interns to work on that area. Very nice culture and felt very inclusive.
2,"November 30, 2021",4,Great pay and decent benefits  Challenging environment but with hard work you can succeed.  There are a lot of hours scheduled for work.  You can make a ton if money but you will spend many hours in the plant.  
3,"November 30, 2021",3,It pays the bills The job would be a lot better if it wasn't so mismanaged. You're just put wherever there's a hole with little to no training. Like most places You're just a number and are replaceable. I wouldn't recommend working here. 
4,"November 29, 2021",3,"Factory Learning Experience Learned a lot about the auto manufacturing process, team development, safety practices, skilled trades roles, and time management in a manufacturing setting."
5,"November 28, 2021",4,"Pay and vaction, holidays off medical coverage was the best ever and my retirement is even better 21 years glad I did it. Ford changed my life and allowed me to provide for my family. It's a great place work if you focus making the money and not letting rhe money make you. There were a lot of people, myself included that got caught up in the drug, drinking culture.  My first 10 years I partied, my 2nd 10 years I went back to school and completed my undergraduate degree and later finishd my masters after retirement. "
6,"November 27, 2021",4,Great pay and paid Holidays The pay is great but the hours are long. If you’re able to do physical work for up to 12 hours it is a great place to work. Medical Insurance is paid for by the company. 
7,"November 26, 2021",1,Terrible place to work. They don’t care about you.  This place is terrible . They make you a temp and will just throw you anywhere move u around to any shift . Could care less about ur home life . Treat u and talk to u like garbage . Everyone is high . The workers smoke and drink on the job. It’s a joke. 
8,"November 26, 2021",3,"Depends on the department  Can be a great company to work for depending on the department you’re in. When I started it was great, but things went down hill after multiple reorganizations causing instability and lack of security. "
9,"November 20, 2021",2,"Overall good place to work Work life balance, vacation, remotes work are some of the pros at Ford. Like most Automobile companies, there is cyclical downturn in sales which may result in lay offs. So expect to see a few over the course of your career"
10,"November 18, 2021",2,Great people terrible management Management makes this job so much harder than what it needs to be actually hated having to go in every day and see these people. Great company to work for great benefits but management is terrible one minute they’re acting like they’re your best friend next minute they’re plunging a knife into your back
11,"November 13, 2021",5,I felt like family with other employees. Everyone was more than helpful. Never felt intimidated by Management. Felt very comfortable talking with and working for/with upper management.  Very supportive by peers.Office equipment readily available. Continuous Training available to employees to enhance their performance.
12,"November 12, 2021",5,Excellent experience if you’re willing to put the work in Working here you get what you put in. The opportunities are endless but you must be willing to exert the effort and hone your own skills. Turnover rate is very high likely due to competitive pay and the schedule. 
13,"November 11, 2021",4,A big company I worked as a sales man. The pay was good. I was able to drive diferent types of Fords through out the years. I like the customers too. I would stay if I could.
14,"November 10, 2021",2,Forklift driver Can not recommend this place. The pay is low and the union does not care about you and is only there to keep ur pay low as a temp.  The team leader we’re very rude and not helpful. You will eventually get injured doing the work there and you will be treated like your not hurt and told to just go back to work or be fired for refusing to work.
15,"November 10, 2021",3,The people are very nice.  The people were very nice but it’s easy to get lost. Also the managers are very tenured and they need to bring some new life in. WhileExperience has an advantage you need to be able to look at things through fresh eyes. 
16,"November 10, 2021",5,Always Learning I have really enjoyed working at Ford. I've been in a few departments and always found the work enjoyable and I feel like I'm constantly learning new things. I also enjoy the people that I work with. They've made me feel included and helped me succeed. Overall I would recommend working here.
17,"November 7, 2021",3,"For people with roots in Michigan Company needs to evolve faster in comparison to adjacent industries and job functions, particularly outside of product development.  Great people who tend to get disenfranchised by the ""Ford"" way.  Probably as good as other opportunities in Michigan though, so ends up being viewed as a 9-to-5 type of company and career."
18,"November 4, 2021",1,"Zero Integrity Not a good place to work if you value honesty and integrity, management will turn on you and take you out. Look at history, they do this to the workforce about once or twice a decade since the 80s. Repeating the same game to reduce salaried costs."
19,"November 4, 2021",4,"Diversity ,  union, but hard to get a job there  I was an independent outsourced employee.  I grew toovr my my job incredibly . I did have several supervisors who were a little rough around the edges. I also made a new family.  As my job ended its contract I did enter the lottery to have a chance for permanent employment. If there was a different policy on how to become hired. What stands out the most to for me is the thst Fird wasn't just a job, it was community, diversity, and inclusion.  A way if life fir the folks. And to be a part of something that mattered was important to me.The people were incredible. "
20,"November 2, 2021",1,Worse place to work  Management is very disrespectful to the employees. They do not like to see you succeed within the company In fact they do everything to hold you back. I would not recommend working in the Ford in Plainfield. The turnover rate is very high most ppl leave within the first week! Also NO BREAKS….. they will tell you it’s a free work environment but if you try to take a break you will get told to get back to work! So expect to work 9 hours a day and every 2 Saturdays.

22,"November 1, 2021",5,Solid Internship I interned as an STA Site Engineer and learned a lot about manufacturing. My supervisor was very supportive and the pay was decent for an internship. 
23,"November 1, 2021",3,It's not as easy as people think Starting pay is low for the tedious tasks and stress compared to other places. If you can stick it out for a few years you'll be hired in full time and get the perks that most people want. 
24,"October 31, 2021",3,Very poor taining If you don't have specific experience with Ford payroll and programs job is extremely challenging. Very unprofessional due to lack of employees. Extremely high turnover. Better hit the ground running a d don't stop for breaks or lunches are non existent. Yelling and berating all day.
25,"October 30, 2021",5,Great employer Ford Motor Company is a place I take great pride in working at. The history of Henry Ford is amazing. The Ford family is extremely generous and gives back to the community.I'm proud to work at Ford Motor Company
26,"October 29, 2021",4,Manufacturing  Ford’s best quality is definitely its benefits. There are many departments so it’s somewhat easy to find a job that is manageable for everyone. Union. 
27,"October 25, 2021",5,Solid place to work Good job security at Ford. Very adaptable for any of your needs if you need to take time off for being sick or to just work from home when important things come up like maintenance coming to your place to fix things. Downsides are that yearly bonuses are based overall on company performance which has been underwhelming the past few years. Can be misused as an employee and be stuck doing something you may not have the qualifications for. 
28,"October 23, 2021",1,"Underpaid, bad management  They don’t pay you anywhere near enough to make a living wage especially when you’re working short weeks or laid off most of the time. Supervisors have no clue what they are doing, "
29,"October 22, 2021",3,Would not recommend  If you enjoy being physically exhausted and overworked this job is perfect for you. Co workers barely do any work. Three days to learn all connections and jobs or you're fired. Supervisors show favoritism and overall not a good environment to work. Pay is okay 
30,"October 19, 2021",5,"Ford Motor Company Overall, Ford is a great place to work. You can learn a lot and everyone treats you like a part of the family. Get to work with so many different parts of the company. "
31,"October 19, 2021",3,It's auto sales Working as a car salesman you have no social life outside work. Pay is good if you work really hard and put in some serious hours. It's perfect for younger kids looking to make a good income and have no established family. 
32,"October 19, 2021",3," Ford Motor Company (MAP)  Long hours, long days, lots of layoffs, great benefits once permanent. Do not have to pay for benefits. College reimbursement offered. Bonuses good. Pay is moderate not great. Stressful work environment physically and risks with Covid. Team leads are great. Supervisors are horrible. Union reps are great. "
33,"October 17, 2021",3,"Decent pay, terrible shift hours, terrible management. Decent company to work for if you want to be another number for a company. Decent starting pay with potential to reach pretty good pay after a few years. Management is terrible and company is understaffed."
34,"October 17, 2021",3,"Good Place but not for long haul This company used to be amazing for building a career, but all the changes made in recent years makes it hard to promote and go up. The benefits are only thing worth while. "
35,"October 15, 2021",5,Good place to work  Ford is a good place to work and invest your skills as a skilled trades person.  If you want to work there is plenty of overtime available if not at your home area you can work at other locations within the Rouge complex.
36,"October 13, 2021",2,"If you want to work, the job is great Ford is a family based company. You never know who is some kin to who. So watch what you say do your assign work, take your breaks, come back on time so the next person can take theirs. Don’t get caught in someone else’s area and your job isn’t complete, or you’re not on a break, communicate with your supervisor at all times and you shouldn’t have any problems."
37,"October 13, 2021",4,"Needs to move faster, improve warranty & cut material costs The overall outlook should be very positive.  Quality and warranty costs are public knowledge - warranty drags down profit.  Ford is moving toward electric vehicles while riding on Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) legacy profits.  Design and launch times need to be reduced.  Customers like the product line-up and there is demand.  Costs need to be reduced to achieve market level sustainable profit margins.  Upper Management is aware of what needs to happen - it comes down to execution at the tactical level."
38,"October 10, 2021",3,"Last Minute Layoffs/Chip Shor The main reason I resigned was due to the frequent layoffs due to chip shortage. I was employed for 8 months, but only worked a total of 3.5 months. January and August were the only months I worked all 4 weeks. Hours would sometimes total 50+ hrs, then drastically drop to 15 - 25 hrs. Sometimes the layoffs would happen suddenly. The 2nd reason was due to people related to each other on the line creating problems and conspiring against other team members."
39,"October 5, 2021",3,Tired  I have no expectations for anyone to do what's right.   I'm not angry or bitter.  I'm just able to see this place for what it is.  The salary turnover is extremely high. 
40,"October 4, 2021",2,"Not a good work environment, very unprofessional, and all over the place  The recon department was very short staff, sales is always coming down to recon to ask when vehicles will be done and would rush the recon department expecting the most when it was very short staff. For the amount of work they expect of us they pay flat rate which isn’t very much and the environment wasn’t safe. After working all week over the weekend our stuff and chemicals would go missing and when you advised the manager they wouldn’t do anything about it. There was no compromising at all. Overall not a professional place at all. "

This was frustrating."
81,"September 11, 2021",4,"Overall good experience but with a few caveats. I enjoy what I do. Working hands on troubleshooting automation equipment used to build world class vehicles is excitin and it constantly challenges me and enables me to learn new things. The manufacturing culture at Ford does not support work/life balance. They claim they do but the constant schedule and shift changes with zero regard for your family life and childcare situations shows otherwise. The working level salary team atmosphere is great but upper management is very disconnected from ""the floor"" and only concerned with arts and charts/checking boxes. Which leads to little support when you need something to do your job or have a personal scheduling issue/concern. They are not open to suggestions or alternative solutions to problems and leave you with a ""take it or leave"" feeling which does not make you feel very valued as an employee."

101,"September 11, 2021",4,"Can be great...if you have good local management Overall enjoyed working here. Many challenging assignments and able to work with new technologies. Most of our senior management tended to understand the major issues and try to help. However, the direct management was not as helpful and would brush over major issues so many lingered for years. This was frustrating."
102,"September 11, 2021",4,"Overall good experience but with a few caveats. I enjoy what I do. Working hands on troubleshooting automation equipment used to build world class vehicles is excitin and it constantly challenges me and enables me to learn new things. The manufacturing culture at Ford does not support work/life balance. They claim they do but the constant schedule and shift changes with zero regard for your family life and childcare situations shows otherwise. The working level salary team atmosphere is great but upper management is very disconnected from ""the floor"" and only concerned with arts and charts/checking boxes. Which leads to little support when you need something to do your job or have a personal scheduling issue/concern. They are not open to suggestions or alternative solutions to problems and leave you with a ""take it or leave"" feeling which does not make you feel very valued as an employee."
103,"September 10, 2021",2,"It has it good days and bad The thing I like least is seniority rules. They treat the temps/new hires bad . The money you make in the beginning isn’t worth it makes you want to quit, I believe the only reason people stay is because of the benefits. You have to wait 2-3 to be hired in.

They mess with temporary employees pay to make the numbers look better and then when you bring it up because they didn't pay you for all your hours the supervisor will tell you they're too busy to deal with your issue. The union doesn't really care to help and you may NEVER see your rep. The only benefit is the insurance and thats not worth the loss of any social life outside of the place. You will be asked to do different task all over the plant and never have a particular job you do everyday. They will even state at orientation that you won't see your family as much as you want, well thats okay if you were compensating me more in line with my life, but your paying a lower or the same rate as places closer to home and without the added problems of never having to know when, where, or what you're doing from day to day.

You have to work with the UAW who fights against every change that is made. Advancement is extremely difficult because most people above you want to stay where they are at because they want to get their 30 years, get their pension, retire and come back contract “double dip”. Most people don’t want to advance because the workload at upper levels is not worth the pay. Change jobs within the company is almost impossible since your manager must approve you to go apply. Most managers don’t want to loose their productive works so non-productive workers are allow to move."

175,"August 11, 2021",1,They treat Temps like trash!!  This company has a great history of making good cars but on the backs of poorly trained workers! The Kansas City plant is the largest in the country and the only plant with no AC it’s most times 105 degrees inside the building which in 2021 is insane and the amount they make per car sold per minute they don’t hand out waters the line never stops people are falling out daily and if your temp you can get sick nor be late for 2 years or your terminated. This is a good company if you have years on the inside easy money but if your a temp don’t waste your time during this pandemic companies are paying way more and making you feel like you belong!! 
176,"August 10, 2021",5,Hard work but rewarding  Everyday is something new good and bad. Overall you feel accomplished. Especially when customers come out of no where thanking you for helping build a quality vehicle that they love. When you see the finish product you feel a sense of purpose. Also when your recognized at work for doing an amazing job on something that many may find impossible or very difficult. 
177,"August 10, 2021",1,"A good place to start but not finish Was a complete joke, lay off after lay off but expect you to be at work on time everyday. And horrible when it comes to bereavement…not all it cracked up to be, this place is overwhelming, overrated, and you will be over worked until they don’t need you Anymore, in my opinion just go back to school…."
178,"August 9, 2021",1, The people I worked with A typical day at work-stressed for 12 to 14 hours a dayWhat did I learn - now that's a great question surviving Management- terrible and that is going easyWorkplace culture- hostile The hardest part of the job- the incompetents of upper management The most enjoyable part of my job- retirement 
179,"August 9, 2021",1,"Terrible  Used to be a dream job, terrible management, terrible benefits, terrible hours, terrible commute. Barely any breaks, union is weak, managers treat you like a dog"
180,"August 8, 2021",4,"Good for a certain ethnic group The work-life balance is good. Lots of work, but no overload.The job is suitable for a specific ethnic group. If you don't match, you will be uncomfortable and will not stay longer."
181,"August 8, 2021",5,Family focused Ford is taking efforts to improve DEI and racial issues.  Is a very large company but everybody knows your name.  Great place to work and advance your career.  Cheers!
182,"August 7, 2021",1,"If you want any life outside of work, NOT HERE. They will change your schedule with no prior knowledge and they dont care what effect that has on your life. They will say your off, then the Friday before that week, say you have to work and its a different shift. They mess with temporary employees pay to make the numbers look better and then when you bring it up because they didn't pay you for all your hours the supervisor will tell you they're too busy to deal with your issue. The union doesn't really care to help and you may NEVER see your rep. The only benefit is the insurance and thats not worth the loss of any social life outside of the place. You will be asked to do different task all over the plant and never have a particular job you do everyday. They will even state at orientation that you won't see your family as much as you want, well thats okay if you were compensating me more in line with my life, but your paying a lower or the same rate as places closer to home and without the added problems of never having to know when, where, or what you're doing from day to day. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who has a family, unless you don't like your family."
183,"August 5, 2021",1,History Too much overtime and poor shift schedule. Was on nights for five years and promised to be rotated to a day shift for three years. Then put on a split shift for approximately for a year. Developed insomnia and poor sleeping habits decided to leave. 
184,"August 5, 2021",4,"Great Place to Start Felt Stuck after Years Working in a plant is a very difficult being an Engineer. You have to work with the UAW who fights against every change that is made. Advancement is extremely difficult because most people above you want to stay where they are at because they want to get their 30 years, get their pension, retire and come back contract “double dip”. Most people don’t want to advance because the workload at upper levels is not worth the pay. Change jobs within the company is almost impossible since your manager must approve you to go apply. Most managers don’t want to loose their productive works so non-productive workers are allow to move."
185,"August 4, 2021",3,Money and benefits  The pay and benefits are the only reason I'm still working for this company. Management only covers their own butts. The labor is hard and it's constantly hot in the building.
186,"July 31, 2021",5,Awesome environment  Great family type atmosphere enjoyed my colleagues and my time there. Was a lot of opportunity only reason I left was to move back home. Other than that I would still be there 
187,"July 30, 2021",2,"Senior Management is ignorant, arrogant and clueless. The management culture is toxic. They expect you to be an *sshole to your reports… therefore you are treated like an *sshole by your superiors. There is no real room for advancement and no progression in management. This is not a place where you can expect to learn from your superiors… just be treated poorly. "
188,"July 30, 2021",3,Poor Leadership in Certain Departments Company wants maximum but gives the bare minimum. Takes forever to become permanent with full benefits. Some of the management has poor attitudes. They won’t provide water in the summer unless it’s over 90 degrees outside even though inside it’s 15 to 20 degrees warmer than outside.
189,"February 18, 2020",5,amazing work place great place to work the tech and management is extremely helpful and friendly. everyone seeks to help others succeed and working here has helped me out over and beyond.
190,"July 29, 2021",4,"Great opportunity but management only sees bottom line The working level under upper management are great and I think work very well together, but management always seems to cut them off at the legs to increase profits."
191,"July 28, 2021",5,"Great company to work for! I greatly enjoyed my time at Ford, and was there for 12 years.  It really does have a family type of feel.  The leadership team has gone through iterations, but for the most part was as strong team.  I learned a ton at Ford and was able to progress my career and my skills."
192,"July 28, 2021",2,They treat you like dogs Disrespectful treatment of employees- be it from the company playing games with part timers or supervisors simply treating all line workers equally bad whether they be good or not.

Work is strictly disturbed to favored employees in the shop. If you messed up on a job minor or big yyou will know cause you will receive nothing but oil changes and over all sh** work.  If you are any race besides white or Mexican you will probably not make it over in the fleet/diesel industrial. Service advisors are very unfair.

Ford MC is a great place to work if you are capable of having excellent attendance during your first 2 years as a temp, which is required before you can become a full-time employee. When I say ""excellent attendance"", I mean if you get sick you better test positive for Covid-19 because that's the only way you'll  keep your job when you return back to work. They give no room for 's**t happens' during your first 2 years as a temp employee. The nurse in the Medical Department along with the Labor Relations Department (aka Human Resources) are very rude to all employees regardless of your employment status, unless of course your a manager or supervisor. Definitely CYOA (cover your own a**! Do NOT trust anything that Medical or Labor says unless you get it in writing because they DON'T CARE about whether or not you have a job! Some work areas are easy, and some are hard. You WILL be sore as he** for your first few weeks...litterally you'll feel like you can't possibly push another pin in. The good thing (I guess) is that your hands will go completely numb eventually. Oh and you don't get to decide what shift or department you work.

561,"December 31, 2020",1,Blood money This was the hardest job i did they really dont train you on a job. Management is a joke they dont know what there doing or god for bid if you stop the line alot cause you wasnt properly train on job write up or mostly temp get fired on spot even if you try get union rep there no where around not in office even if you call. Then if you try move up better know people or banging someone cause they wont let you get off that line then or know headed people goodluck 
562,"December 24, 2020",4,Every day had different projects.   Pay and benefits were excellent. If you had aprobem to solve sometimes l.p. you had to deal with several levels of management to solve it.   Also any issues such as health insurance could be difficult to deal with since the main human resources office is in Dearborn Mich.
563,"December 22, 2020",3,"Good money, terrible if you want a life. The benefits of working at Ford are numerous. They include fantastic insurance of all kinds, student grants, and a good hourly wage. However, the unpredictable politics of the company/union war is stressful. The hours are also advertised as 8 hour days but, everyday for the last year has been 11 hours wit mandatory 10 hour Saturdays scattered in. Things like these can easily effect a family life or mental health. Think about these things before applying. "

566,"December 18, 2020",5,"This was one of the best jobs I have had in my career, I was very sad that funding went away for my position. Working for Ford was a relaxed working environment and probably the highlight of my working career to date, plus a lot of great people to work with.   I started working as a Unified Communications Engineer and really enjoyed my job working there, unfortunately I got transferred to another group just before the whole COVID-19 pandemic hit and funding was then cut for my job. One aspect of the company I don't really agree with is when they assign employees to a new position, the employee does not get a say in what the new job assignment may be or if they even want to move to another position.  The workplace culture is fairly relaxed and flexible with a very diverse culture.  I will really miss the various people that I have worked with there during my relatively short time. "

You can never make them happy with your results. You get forced to work up to 16 hour shifts fairly often (Monday-Friday). Plus fairly often you'll be forced to work an 8 hour Saturday with minimal notice. Meaning Friday late evening you're informed that you're working Saturday (8AM-5PM). Training is pathetic. After you make enough mistakes they will finally get qualified trainers to train you for a few days, if you're lucky 5 days straight. But only for roughly 4 hours of your shift. After the trainer leaves, your expected to operate the SAP system, create endless new resorts and manage everything and everyone prefectly. If you don't, you'll get drilled.Need a day or more off work? Better be an expert begger! Yet watch the Superintendent take almost every Friday off for ""Family Fun Days."" Don't worry if you're lucky you'll get two days with your family a week. That's more than enough right? Don't expect the Superintendent to help you with much of anything but the minor, easy tasks.

As long as you stay positive, the people around you are uplifting, informative and entertaining. You really get to know your coworkers and management in such an intense environment. Even the plant manager will come to the floor to be hands on in an effort to solve an ongoing problem. We’re all on the same team. Unfortunately it seems to be company policy to keep the attrition rate high, and there’s no uniformity in how discipline is meted out. It’s best to never be late and never be absent without reason. As long as you show up and put forth a good faith effort, you’re mostly secure in your job. The union works with the company, so sometimes it seems like they have your back and sometimes they clearly side with the company wishes and turn a blind eye to our grievances. You will lose weight on this job! And you will gain muscle! When the line is running well, you’re literally on your feet working for hours at a time. Most days we work 10+ hours plus about 80 minutes worth of breaks. The breaks pass very quickly.

The good pay makes the long hours seem bearable. The benefits are great, but you need them as over time the repetitive nature of your job brings strains and injuries. "
842,"July 11, 2020",4,Not a bad place at all Wish I would have started sooner.  I spent a great deal of time working at jobs that I thought would lead onward and upward.  This turned out not to be the case.
843,"July 10, 2020",1,"My boss and LL6 and his Boss an LL4, there was no middle layer My boss was very incompetent, he ask me for how to run a migration of a cloud project and when I provided that and told him how to run the project stole my idea and present it as his own, lied to his boss regarding reports where he couldn't figure out how to calculate numbers and blame me for mistakes, when I ask to talk to the level up, the reply from up above was that I trust my team, when I ask I am member of the team, they told me I am not because I am an contractor, I ran two successful projects in the same department but didn't matter, as these mangers both were white and claim they do not discriminate, but actions speaks louder then words, The most racist and back stabbing company, they hire minorities but do bare minimum to support them. You have to be an YES man and come to realize, if there's a choice between white and other races, they will always favor white people, if they are incompetent, it does not matter all they care as long you are white, I felt the whole time like I am walking on egg shells. You can't afford to make a mistake. I did not made any mistakes and still got the shaft."

848,"July 3, 2020",1,Horrible place to work I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here unless you don't care how you're being treated.

851,"June 27, 2020",4,"Good experience for an intern I was hired by Ford as a supply chain intern. My projects for this summer internship included the following:Led the implementation of a repeatable, visual spare parts catalog in which over 2,000 items were updated to reduce mean time between repairs and waste in manpower from inaccurate requisitionsServed as a liaison between plant and staff employees and utilized a data analytics concept predictive model to contribute $11,456 in inventory reductionsConducted a time study to estimate manpower waste cost due to inaccurate requisitionsWhile the projects taught me overall how continuous improvement projects add value, they did not teach me any hard skills that I could transfer on to other experiences. This is why I believe I did not have as strong of a chance in receiving a full-time offer from the company."

The CEO, in hos own mind"" is ""esoteric"", but his employee communications are condescending. Be very cautious of social network posts; Ford has a great social network prescence where they ""bury"" the various websites with positive ratings and comments.

Zero professional development, training budget is tiny and continually cut or it doesn't even exist. Very toxic, aggressive, male-dominated culture especially in product development. The company says one thing in public to please investors and Wall Street and does exactly the opposite day-to-day, then tries to spin that into evidence they are doing what they said they would do. Technology-wise, the company is 5, possibly even 10 years behind everyone else. If you are young and are thinking about starting a family, you might be OK at Ford as they do give you many weeks off if you have a new baby. Otherwise, if you are older, have a family that is already established, are looking for true professional development and advancement beyond just going to work for one of the other automotive companies, you should look elsewhere."

They allow everyone that has lost the job to at least give you a second chance. But I get unfair treatment and got shot out the door.  And I busted my hind in for them.
1456,"November 17, 2019",5,Great place to work for Worked to a family owned business at ford commercial dealership. Learned a lot about trucks and sales . I am not a sales person at all but I provide the services needed for the consumer to obtain a great quality and prompt service.

The company is overly micro managed and has no structure of people who know what they are doing or how things should be ran. Higher up workers treat us as if we are scum.

1462,"November 14, 2019",4,What I learned about it was I loved working at FMC and the company benefits/ paid time off/ bonuses/ pay rate/ and relaxed dress code. Work/ life balance at my plant in Memphis Tennessee was pretty good. The only problem is the Poor Communication Skills between the direct management and employees due to having a union the management doesn’t want to follow proper protocol. Union Jobs are great!
1463,"November 13, 2019",4,Good Job Overall it’s a good place to work with great benefits. You get frequent bonuses and paid vacation time. The environment isn’t bad but management can become a hassle
1464,"November 13, 2019",2,"Unless you are a collections rep, this place isn’t for you The company is very behind the times. If you are hired into any role other than Collections (aka “Customer Service”) you MUST work in Collections for an unknown length of time, until you find another role to apply to. Without going to the Collections department, you will not have any ability to move around the company. The Collections department is hard-core, outbound calls to customers, their family and friends, and their employers - you will also simultaneously be expected to take inbound customer calls. The pay here is low considering the nature of the job roles for associates in a phone role (you are expected to process accounts, in addition to taking inbound and outbound phone calls). If you are a collector, this place will love you. The time off and benefits policies are poor in comparison to most major call centers in Colorado Springs."

1475,"November 18, 2019",5,Industrial Electrician I had twenty four years automotive manufacturing experience prior to employment at Ford Motor Co. The plant that I work at is a dual product facility. Producing both the Transit vans and F-150 pickups with many of opportunities for exposure to manufacturing systems.
1476,"November 18, 2019",5,Wish i could get my job back My review lol I have no review or a job and I been looking for 8months . The job is amazing to be there I wish I could get it back . They allow everyone that has lost the job to at least give you a second chance. But I get unfair treatment and got shot out the door.  And I busted my hind in for them.
1477,"November 17, 2019",5,Great place to work for Worked to a family owned business at ford commercial dealership. Learned a lot about trucks and sales . I am not a sales person at all but I provide the services needed for the consumer to obtain a great quality and prompt service.
1478,"November 17, 2019",1,Worst management I’ve ever worked for Management has no clue how to run anything. The company is overly micro managed and has no structure of people who know what they are doing or how things should be ran. Higher up workers treat us as if we are scum. Constant ridicule from individuals who have no respect other then their own. People who are in the favorite pool get away with everything under the sun and others are disciplined
1479,"November 17, 2019",4,"Good place to work Good work-life balance.Nice place to start careerExciting projects to work onGood job culture.Work environment can be improved.Management can be slow sometimes"
1480,"November 17, 2019",1,Stressful and always watching your back. The leadership has no idea where to direct the team.  There is no focus except to pay consultants to do the leaderships' job because they have no idea what to do.
1481,"November 15, 2019",5,I would love to be working here again I wish I could get picked up again for Ford motor company.. Even if i would have to relocate again. The work I do now is seasonal and not steady enough to live comfortably.
1482,"November 15, 2019",1,Bad place to work They treat their workers like garbage. Like them and their health doesn't matter. The money was nice but management sucked and nobody seemed to care about your health.
1483,"November 14, 2019",4,What I learned about it was I loved working at FMC and the company benefits/ paid time off/ bonuses/ pay rate/ and relaxed dress code. Work/ life balance at my plant in Memphis Tennessee was pretty good. The only problem is the Poor Communication Skills between the direct management and employees due to having a union the management doesn’t want to follow proper protocol. Union Jobs are great!
1484,"November 13, 2019",4,Good Job Overall it’s a good place to work with great benefits. You get frequent bonuses and paid vacation time. The environment isn’t bad but management can become a hassle
1485,"November 13, 2019",2,"Unless you are a collections rep, this place isn’t for you The company is very behind the times. If you are hired into any role other than Collections (aka “Customer Service”) you MUST work in Collections for an unknown length of time, until you find another role to apply to. Without going to the Collections department, you will not have any ability to move around the company. The Collections department is hard-core, outbound calls to customers, their family and friends, and their employers - you will also simultaneously be expected to take inbound customer calls. The pay here is low considering the nature of the job roles for associates in a phone role (you are expected to process accounts, in addition to taking inbound and outbound phone calls). If you are a collector, this place will love you. The time off and benefits policies are poor in comparison to most major call centers in Colorado Springs."

The company historically has gone through these type of reductions about every 8-10 years,  It reduces, and then over time builds resources up again, and then has to adjust again with reductions.  There are a lot of jobs open now for new, younger, lower paid, no pension positions.  Ford does pay well and there are a lot of career opportunities if you want to pursue them.

1761,"August 31, 2019",4,Great learning experience for a young engineer looking to enter the automotive industry. I learned the process of taking an automotive engineering concept to production using Ford Motor Company's unique process. The engineers responsible for showing me the ropes were very experienced and excellent teachers.
1762,"August 31, 2019",1,"Not the Ford I knew When I was a child, my family was a ""Ford Family"" meaning we owned and drove Ford vehicles. I grew up knowing Ford to be the premier car manufacturer and a place to aspire to work for. When I was recruited by Ford to work at their proving grounds, I was elated beyond belief. This elation became nightmarish once I began working for Ford at the Proving Grounds. The purpose and goal of the proving ground used to be, testing vehicles not yet available to the public in order to find problems for correction, components that failed our didn't work, etc. Once at the Proving Ground, I found that management there was ONLY interested in getting the prototype vehicles in, running them through the tests (ignoring issues), getting them out and getting paid for the work. While there, I found what I will call serious issues with a steering assist module on multiple vehicle platforms. Ford and I parted company because I would not let go of this issue and ignore it! This module actually caused injury to me while testing. Ford ignored this. Management ordered me to limit my notes and write-ups on this and other issues and explained to get the cars in and out. Never to own a Ford EVER!"
1763,"August 30, 2019",1,Don’t waste your time Well this company doesn’t care about you. You are just a number. You are treated like a slave. Management is a joke with no college degrees . You will not move up in company. People work here for 15 yrs before you get promoted to a team leader. Very stressful job listening to customers complain all the time. Very old systems and outdated. I am so happy I left this company.

He was not there to help and made the workplace a hostile environment. I loved managing the website, photography, price and inventory but the management was poor. We had to figure out everything on our own because they didn't have anyone training. He would fire people every week."

Most over the age of the Millennial resist keeping up their computer skills or learning anything new."

Management does not stand behind their employees decisions.  Insurance was fantastic but there were people that clearly abused it but no repercussions for them. You are passed up for promotion unless you are part of the 'in crowd' even if you are at the top of the performance game. Was not allowed to go into the management program because i was a new mom and the hours may not work for me."

There definitely is a wonderful family feel that starts with Bill Ford. The history of the company is also inspiring and fascination.   The problem is upper management starting at the Chief level.

Some places offered a better work life balance than others. Some offered more opportunities for advancement than others. Some managers were more accommodating than others. There was little consistency. Overall, to become a manager, you basically need to be at the company 10 years. I had colleagues leave to receive manager roles at other companies that only people with 20-year tenures receive at Ford. The pay and benefits are amazing though, so it’s very easy to get trapped."

Your experiece will depend on how open and willing you are to throw yourself into any project or work people hand you."
1937,"July 30, 2019",5,Great place to work! Loved working at Ford Credit. I was given many opportunities to advance and increase my knowledge. The people are awesome. Everyone helps everyone else.

1940,"July 30, 2019",1,"Good pay, terrible company, discrimination against job title They treat ""temporary"" workers like garbage even when they are employed through the same company and not a temp agency. Temporary implies that it's not long term so you'd think they'd do some hiring each year, maybe in small batches, considering they preach in orientation about how you came in at a good time to be hired ""full-time"" and yet they never hire you. They never hire anybody for that matter, not unless you know somebody important or are their relative."
1941,"July 29, 2019",1,"This was a horrible place to work No work life balance, stressful, constant back stabbing and belittling by upper management. Pay and benefits stink! Only good thing was that you could get a decent discount when purchasing a vehicle"

Hardest part of job was listening to customers yell at you all day and belittling you and cursing at you. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning about titles and where lease cars end up after Lease termination.

1946,"July 25, 2019",3,"Corporate Politics are a Nightmare I can only speak for the field, but the culture varied widely depending on your region and management. Some places offered a better work life balance than others. Some offered more opportunities for advancement than others. Some managers were more accommodating than others. There was little consistency. Overall, to become a manager, you basically need to be at the company 10 years. I had colleagues leave to receive manager roles at other companies that only people with 20-year tenures receive at Ford. The pay and benefits are amazing though, so it’s very easy to get trapped."
1947,"July 25, 2019",5,"Good company to work for I enjoyed my time at Ford and would do it again in a heartbeat.  Good work environment, supportive management, good career opportunities.  It is easy to have a direct connection to the products and be able to relate to what you are working on."

Every contract employee wishes to be hired in and they string them all along but there are no opportunities to go direct. Only opportunities to do more work for less pay. These employees work side by side with Ford’s but don’t receive most of the benefits including good pay and paid time off for the days Ford is closed and no bonuses either. It was very frustrating to work hard for years without being hired in. The only admin that got promoted was the one who slept with all the engineers in the building."

I knew all the jobs like the back of my hand.

2235,"May 14, 2019",1,"Very stressful job Extremely fast paced, back breaking job. Your work isn't valued nor appreciated. Non communication between workers & supervisors. To many supervisors on one line"
2236,"May 14, 2019",5,Fast Pace Automotive Industry Ford is a family based company in the highly competitive automotive industry.  The auto business has been difficult in the last years with the development of autonomous vehicles and electrical vehicle start-ups.  It offers the opportunity to work on great products that you see driving down the road.  Recommended for a person who wants a challenge and is willing to work long hours.
2237,"May 13, 2019",5,"Inspiring Data Scientist Goal oriented, passionate data scientist with a continuous learning mindset. Currently analyzing manufacturing mean time to repair, mean time between failure data for use in discrete event simulation models. Looking to continue applying skills in industry 4.0 projects."
2238,"May 13, 2019",3,"prodution worker My typical day at work would be starting off on a job not knowing for sure if I would be working on that particular job for the day; until they figure out who was all at work and what jobs needed to be covered. The work place culture was alright something I had to get use to since I never worked In a plant before; it was exactly how it sounded a plant (plantation) no windows, no air condition. around the summer time it felt like death, it be unbearable. The hardest part of the job was really the first couple of weeks there learning all the jobs but then once I got familiar with the jobs it was light work and became easy. I knew all the jobs like the back of my hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers I met so many loving, caring, funny people;people I actually built relationships with and would talk to them outside of work. Management was kind of off but that just something I got use to while working at Ford Motor Company."
2239,"May 13, 2019",4,Challenging and rewarding I worked here in the product planning division. It gave me the opportunity to work with may different program directors across multi-functional lines of technology
2240,"May 13, 2019",3,Difficult to grow for minorities Ford is a good company due to the number of opportunities to learn new things in different areas. My biggest complaint is that for minorities is very difficult to grow in the company. It takes more years for a member of a minority group to climb the management ladder or get into it than for a person that is not part of a minority.
2241,"May 11, 2019",4,Great place to work Ford starts u off as a TPT and u move up from there to an STS then full time. The pros for Ford is the hrs are great and you are offered the overtime on the daily basis.

2977,"October 4, 2018",1,"Outdated attitude toward assembly workers This job is more intended for someone who really doesn't intend to do too much as far as a career outlook is concerned. It's monotonous, boring, and kinda makes you think about bettering your life.The starting pay is well below average for this kind of work $15.78( I live in the Chicago area so this cannot support a family) But, they have good benefits, which explains the low pay.I hear this has been their starting wage for at least the past 15 years.  The work culture is rife with drug use, favoritism, and unprofessionalism. You get 3 shifts, and you don't get choose to which one you prefer. 6am-5:30pm; 6pm-5;30am(hybrid shift) and swing shift Thur-Fri 6am-5:30pm Sat-Sun 6pm-5:30am.

2984,"October 10, 2018",4,The job is sort of what you make it and is dependent on your seniority. I had my good and bad days at Ford but I can say overall it is a very nice job to have and to keep down the line in the future. Very established franchise and it is very hard to get in so once you’re in you want to stay. You’re working for one of the best companies in the United States and at times you have to remind yourself how lucky you are to have such a coveted job.
2985,"October 10, 2018",5,Productive work place Great job the pay is good all the Suporvisors I encountered was professional. Just didn’t like starting as a part time employee without dental and vision coverage. Other than that a great place to work

I've mainly overall learned how to be firm with customers when necessary and how to problem solve when customers call in with issues. The management is definitely easy to talk to and get along with and the culture is very comfortable. Sometimes we have spirit week, we also have the FUN committee and we have potlucks, especially when there are team birthdays."
2988,"October 9, 2018",5,"I was very proud to say I worked at Ford I worked with Facility Management Group and loved everyday.  My primary responsibility was badge access but also assigned keys, changed cores, helped with move layouts, evacuation procedures.  Became Green Belt Certified."

2991,"October 7, 2018",3,"Stuck in the Weeds Ford to it's credit is trying to take a step in the right direction by modernizing, but is unable to trim the fat. Too many employees have little understanding of technology, and meetings are viewed as work."
2992,"October 7, 2018",5,Challenging place to work Skills will be developed within a peer supportive environment.  The company provides a great benefit package and competitive salary well ahead of national averages.
2993,"October 6, 2018",2,"Too much restrictions on agency not a good company for agency, too many restrictions on agency, work life balance is very difficult as we have to manage weekly hours and need to be in office. no work from home."
2994,"October 6, 2018",5,Fleet Credit Analyst Great workers and fast paced office environment. Management was always rotating to new positions within the company. Very good perks but pay was a little below average for the industry.
2995,"October 5, 2018",1,Supervisor Never work in a more racially degrading and oppressively intimidating place in my life.  Management style archaic and unbearable to many supervisors.  I hated coming to work here.
2996,"October 5, 2018",5,knowledge of warehousing/distribution Working at Ford for the past 13yrs was a great experiment and the knowledge I learn there working as a Warehouse Supervisor makes me a excellent candidate to walk into any warehouse and go right to work.
2997,"October 4, 2018",5,"Hard work Definitely a fast paced work force. Hard work, and tough on the body.  Great benefits and salary, especially with overtime.  There was talk of the area shutting down, so I decided to look elsewhere."
2998,"October 4, 2018",1,"Outdated attitude toward assembly workers This job is more intended for someone who really doesn't intend to do too much as far as a career outlook is concerned. It's monotonous, boring, and kinda makes you think about bettering your life.The starting pay is well below average for this kind of work $15.78( I live in the Chicago area so this cannot support a family) But, they have good benefits, which explains the low pay.I hear this has been their starting wage for at least the past 15 years.  The work culture is rife with drug use, favoritism, and unprofessionalism. You get 3 shifts, and you don't get choose to which one you prefer. 6am-5:30pm; 6pm-5;30am(hybrid shift) and swing shift Thur-Fri 6am-5:30pm Sat-Sun 6pm-5:30am. It is what it is, it's not for everyone. One person's trash is another person's treasure."

Ordering parts from the parts dept., and then scheduling the work to be done when the parts came in, getting warranty authorization for payment, -(or customer payment authorization after preparing a cost estimate was not always an easy thing- telling someone that  a part and the replacement costs are several dollars is Never easy) was all part of the day.Seeing new cars and sometimes older classic cars was fun and meeting new people and reconnecting with long time customers was gratifying."

It would have lasted longer but, once I went to college, the manager didn't want to work around my schedule and instead gave me some made up useless job of calling customers that recently had vehicles worked on to see if they were satisfied. Problem was, they expected me to solve their issues and I am not a mechanic nor did I know enough to help, so I was set up to fail. I think overall people are pretty happy working there, although there is discord with salesmen and the service team, because the former thinks they are better than the latter - which is untrue.

I am very good at listening to what people are saying and figuring out what they are actually trying to say. I am good at working with people and technicians to come to an understanding of the problem and the work needed to fix the problem. Ordering parts from the parts dept., and then scheduling the work to be done when the parts came in, getting warranty authorization for payment, -(or customer payment authorization after preparing a cost estimate was not always an easy thing- telling someone that  a part and the replacement costs are several dollars is Never easy) was all part of the day.Seeing new cars and sometimes older classic cars was fun and meeting new people and reconnecting with long time customers was gratifying."

Or if you are in a team setting then the team leader takes the good work from the rest of the team get paid good while the other team members do not.  Ended up worked weekends (7days in a row) to get a paycheck to pay bills.

Everyday is learning experience, technology is changing rapidly, therefor we are always on a learning curve. Management has to work with me to continue to strive to improve.

You are paid by the work that you do (commission) but if no one brings a car/truck in to get worked on then you will not get paid.  Or if you are in a team setting then the team leader takes the good work from the rest of the team get paid good while the other team members do not.  Ended up worked weekends (7days in a row) to get a paycheck to pay bills.  If Ford requires you to be at work then they should pay you to be there not write you up because you are not at work due to no work.  I love the ford product but will never work for them again."

Based on your position within the company you will have a fantastic ability to work on your time, but with that freedom comes the 50+ hr weeks.

It's very Office Space -esque. The most difficult part of my job was honestly finding meaningful and engaging work to accomplish.

There is very little opportunity for advancement or promotion for someone starting out on the plant floor.  Often times one's only option for getting a less physically-demanding job that utilizes one's skills and talent, is to go the UAW route, which is super cliquey.  As I mentioned, my experience has been that Ford (the company itself) does not promote from within, even for qualified employees.

It's rare within one company to be able to get experience in manufacturing, product development, marketing, purchasing, treasury, and a host of other areas. Most financial analyst jobs generally have good content and are fairly well structured. As you work your way up into management, the job content broadens and you get an opportunity to manage teams. However, with such a large company, the bureaucracy can be particularly frustrating at times, as it is difficult to be empowered to make any decisions (even some that may seem more trivial). The culture is one of family and often collaborative. Overall, it is a great place to get a range of finance experiences and broaden your knowledge and skills."

Unfortunately, as an hourly based employee, there are not many opportunities for my career aspirations of management or administration.  Ford has a great employee benefit package, and their hourly pay of a two-tier system is progressive. The working culture is production driven, which can often induce a little more stress than a normal working environment. Ultimately, I believe Ford motor Co. is a great place to work."

I have learned many different operations with the company from the computer system, to how to operate different machines. Management can be a bit hectic at times, but it's their job to keep the facility running at top performance at all times. There are not many difficulties about the job. If I were to pinpoint one, it would have to be having to deal with the small, minor inconveniences that can occur on a daily basis.

I made it my personal goal to provide the best deal posssible for my clients."

I felt owning my own business would lead me to a greater financial success..

Until I moved into the Greenville area and on the motor mile I loved it. I think it's just this dealership that has the stingiest pay plan in the car business. The owner is stashing all his toys, cars, boats, etc under our nose and even running out of room for them while the sales people are starving. The GM gives one guy all the house deals and there isn't any bonuses worth mentioning here."

4645,"September 22, 2017",2,Management need to be replaced Office personal is overworked and unappreciated. Plus management doesnt have a clue how to run an office much less how to do the job required of her or the staff.

Also needs to hire enough people to do the jobs required and not expect 2 to do the work of 5.

There are to many chiefs and not enough employees here, and supervisors and upper management love to bark orders but do not want to help out when needed.  If you are sick, I mean really sick, you should stay home instead of spreading germs to everyone and passing the bug, not here.  You are expected to be at work no matter what.  Their scheduling is interesting, if it is slow, and no calls, instead of letting employees go home and save on the bottom line they keep everyone there.What I did like was that they had fundraisers for various different organizations, I found this to be awesome in team building at least with the team leaders that participated.  They have a set of rules, which for the most I agree with 100%, except for the part, when you have to get permission to use the bathroom for a certain amount of time.  If you are away from your phone for longer than they like, they come into the bathroom wanting to know how long you will be."

My supervisor was very knowledgable about the day to day performance of an Assembly Line and provided feedback on my job performance. I had a good worj=king relationship with my co-workers, learning how to be a team member and an asset to the job.Maintaining the correct employee number to facilitate the operation of all the job stations, with as few errors, as possible by the employees I would borrow from other zones."
