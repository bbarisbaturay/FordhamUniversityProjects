0, 10 days ago,5,"I have a 2009 Yaris that I purchased used and it was the best decision I ever made. It is compact which is perfect for me as I am 5'2"" and have to sit to close to the stealing wheel in other cars. All my friends are jealous of the gas mileage that I get and in the two years I have had it the only maintenance it has required is oil changes. I surprised that it had a designated 12volt outlet as well as an aux cord which have made my 30 minute commutes much more enjoyable. Perfect for city driving. So disappointed that Toyota is discontinuing this model."
1,21 days ago,5,2021 Toyota RAV4 hybrid is amazing. I feel so safe when I drive this car. I drive long long hours for work and I’m comfortable and feel like I can see the road really easily in this. I switched from a Toyota Camry hybrid and couldn’t be happier! The steering wheel on this car is really smooth to use. There’s a great grip in the middle bottom for driving. The seats are also extremely comfortable. I love the display for Apple CarPlay as well. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase of the Toyota RAV4 hybrid highly recommend!Also great on gas.￼
2, 25 days ago,5,I am so in love with my new Toyota RAV4 premium. The blizzard pearl goes great with the nutmeg interior leather. You can’t beat the gas mileage! I am currently getting 32 mpg. The size is perfect for me and my family.
3,2 months ago,5,"By far the best SUV I've ever owned! I bought it used with barely over 20k miles on it and am just now getting to 50k miles, and I still love it! The trade-in/resale value is still at the amount I originally paid for it, so that's awesome! It's just a reliable, good quality, all around great vehicle!"
4, 2 months ago,5,Have a Corolla and it held up with little to no pricey maintenance.  I enjoy cars that last and don't break down easily.   I plan to drive it until it dies.
5, 2 months ago,5,"This car is amazing. I love it so much. We bought it a year ago and I still think it is the best car for its price and quality. It takes 6.6L/100 km. Has a 3D camera, many different sensors. More than enough space for a family with 2 small kids."
6, 3 months ago,5,"My 1st car was a used 1977 Corolla. I loved it and drove the crap out of it. Never had a problem! Now we have a 1997 4runner. We have taken it cross country twice in the last 3 years. Never a problem! Absolutely love it! We are sitting at 290,00 miles and it still runs like a new car!"
7, 3 months ago,5,"I love my Toyota Rav 4! Perfect size for my little family, plenty of space in the back for my toddler’s growing legs. Amazing amount of cargo space to haul even larger stuff than usual (I.e. wheelbarrow or dishwasher). Gets great gas mileage for an SUV. All around I would definitely recommend!"
8, 4 months ago,5,"This company had taken such great care of me and my family over the years. For starters my family hasn't bought another new vehicle besides Toyota since the eighties. They have been so reliable. The Toyota that I am referring to had 350,000 original miles on it before we sold it. All we had to do is make sure that we kept up on the oil changes and the rest of the regular maintenance. I will forever sing Toyota's praises. 
On to newer times. Today I had to go buy a new car. As many know this is not a fun event. This dealership made this as painless as possible. Not only did they give us the lowest market value price and trust me I looked everywhere. It's a certified used 2020 Camry with and 15,000 mi on it. All of their certified used vehicles come with a 100k MI powertrain or a 12,000 MI bumper to bumper warranty. They also included a free remote start. There wasn't a lot of hassling. We let them know that we were going to be using our own finance company and they didn't continue to try to barter with us to use their finance company because they know that we would get a better deal with our own. I will forever be grateful for how a humane today's events were. For how human they made us feel and not like another dollar sign."
9, 4 months ago,5,"It has been since the 90's since I have driven a Camary, but I loved it then and I still love the look of them now."
10, 4 months ago,5,Great vehicle! Toyota is a great car company and they produce reliable vehicles that last. I have an 08 RAV4 and I haven’t had it break down on me yet. This vehicle has made me a Toyota person.
11, 5 months ago,5,omg I have 05 toyota camry and it is amazing I wouldn't have any other vehicle. great on gas and lasts forever so roomy. I just love it and it was a very reasonable price I would definitely recommend
12, 5 months ago,5,"I love my Camry hybrid.  It is so quiet and spacious for me and my family.  One of my favorite things is the seat warmer.  This car is pretty affordable.  I wanted to get an electric car, but a lot of them were way out of my price range.  This car is a good compromise and I’ve had it for 11 years now and have driven it all over the country.  It gets great gas mileage."
13, 5 months ago,5,Me gusta mucho mi carro buena marca además cómodo espaciosos sus colores bellos lo recomiendo
14, 5 months ago,5,"Love my 2021 Highlander XLE! The seats are extremely comfortable, it feels high tech, still a decent trunk even with the third row up, love all the seating. The gas mileage could be better, but it's decent for a big SUV"
15,5 months ago,5,I’ve had my Corolla for a few years now and I absolutely love it. It has wonderful gas mileage and is a nice size for young drivers especially as a first car.
16, 5 months ago,5,"I purchased my first new car in 2013 and it was the Prius V. I love this car - the mileage isn’t quite as amazing as advertised, but given I’m in Canada and have the heater blasting for at least 5 months and the AC for 2, it’s not surprising. It is still nice to only have to fill up every 2 weeks or so (or every 5 months during lockdown😂) and the 45L tank size makes that gas bill easier to swallow. This car has tonnes of room. I’ve taken all the supplies - food, crafts, gear for 20 Girl Guides to camp and still had room for me, my daughter and our personal gear. I am sad they discontinued the V line, I would easily consider another for my next vehicle. #hybrid #car #automotive"
17,5 months ago,5,I have my Toyota car -Matrix for 11 years now and it’s still going. I’m so impressed that I have to give it a good review. It is so economical in terms of gas consumption. I like the trunk space and utilize it so much from groceries to Christmas trees and so much more. The service at the dealership when I bring my car for oil/tire change (and other routine services) is great. The staffs are nice and accommodating. I’m hoping for a lot more years with my car. Definitely considering another Toyota when a replacement is needed.
18, 5 months ago,5,"I bought my Corolla at the start of 2018 and absolutely love it. I desperately needed a new car and the dealership worked so hard helping me purchase it. It’s been incredibly reliable, excellent on gas and drives great. I couldn’t be happier!"
19, 6 months ago,5,"The perfect small car! If you want something that is cute, reliable, good on gas and can still manage to fit a lot of cargo, then this is a great pick! It doesn’t come with a ton of bells and whistles, but I do have a touch screen and sport mode which is fun…but lets me honest we buy cars like these because they are a great value and will never let you down. It doesn’t have a to. If power though so if you want to accelerate really quickly you might find it lacking, but for every day driving it’s perfect!"
20, 6 months ago,5,"Smooth ride, reliable build, excellent warranty and easy on the eyes.  Smoother ride than the Rav4 or the 4-Runner, and nice and roomy.  They also hold their value better than most other brands."
21, 6 months ago,5,"Dependability meets style! I have owned two different RAV4’s and I have loved both. They are zippy but good on gas, spacious enough to load furniture but small enough to easily park. It’s the Goldilocks of small SUVs! What I love most is how reliable it is, because it’s Toyota I know I don’t have to worry about it lasting, and I know it will retain its value."
22, 6 months ago,5,I love the brand and its products have been using them for years and their quality is second to none.  All their products are the best
23, 6 months ago,5,I love the brand and its products have been using them for years and their quality is second to none.  All their products are the best
24, 6 months ago,3,I bought a brand new 2020 rav4 hybrid and at first I loved it but there are a lot things that need to be fixed. I have hit 2 deer in 6 months both major accidents and while the car did well in both accidents in keeping everyone safe at high speeds I believe I have hit the deer because the car is just too quiet. If you live in a rural area with a lot of deer or commute through areas like that I would not suggest this car. The gas mileage is great I averaged around 40-45 on daily work commutes and around 33 on highway. The seat does not go back far enough. I am 5’6 and max out the leg room. My bf who is 6’2 hates driving in it because of this and how small it feels inside. It needs a little more power the cruise control has trouble staying at the speed you set to. The remote start worked like 3x and never again and you have to pay for the app to have that luxury. A key fob would work much better for the remote start instead of an app. It drives smoothly but the quiet of the engine will make me never want to drive it again in fear more animals will run out in front of me.
25, 6 months ago,4,It’s very comfortable and has wonderful power. Gets good mpg even when fully loaded. The car has a great amount of technology in it and is a smooth ride. Great SUV overall.
26, 6 months ago,4,"This car is perfect for a couple, has great technology, gets roughly 30mpg, very comfy bucket seats, needs more in the power spectrum for my taste. The car was a good price for what you get. It has been very reliable so far with no major problems and I’m at 85,000 miles."
27, 6 months ago,5,"I’m gonna give these a 5 star. I’ve never owned one myself but I have friends and family who have and even the old ones are still being driven today! I’ve always seen that these cars are good quality and last a very long time when taken care of, and I have 2 different friends who have been in wrecks in this vehicle and it was so much safer for them than another car would have been. I think this is a great car to have. ESP for a first time driver needing a reliable and safe vehicle. Corollas and Camry’s are the go to!"
28,6 months ago,4,My son bought a 2021 Toyota Corolla it is a great car and has lots of nice features. It's a beautiful design spacious backseat midsize trunk. The only thing that I dislike about the car is that it does not have the light on the side  mirrors that tells you when someone's in your blind spot.
29, 6 months ago,5,"Toyota products are the bomb! We have owned two corollas, a prius and a matrix! Next up will be a 4x4 now that our family is bigger. Upper James Toyota in Hamilton, Ontario is the place to find your (next) Toyota - they treat you like family!"
30, 6 months ago,5,"I think this car is 💯 awesome!!! We just got it. It’s a 2018 and drives like a dream. I don’t know much about cars, so I’ll just tell you from my point of view. Apparently it gets 50 mpg on the Highway. It uses unleaded gas and does not have to be plugged in. It comes with all the little luxuries of a new car. My favorite is the backup screen on the console. Now I’m speechless. I don’t have enough knowledge to sell a car. But that’s not my job here. Someone did that for us. I can say that I think it was pretty expensive ( maybe not). $23,000. I did learn from the dealership that all of the dealerships will be selling Hybrids only. That might take awhile, but we thought we’d better join in. That’s all I have.  I promise if you drive one, you’ll fall in love"
31, 6 months ago,5,"I have a 2007 4Runner and the best of the best is Toyota.  They are comfortable, cute and durable.  Love it.  It is spacious, spacious, requires almost no maintenance and is a top quality vehicle"
32, 7 months ago,5,Good drive while renting it. Easy to drive but not very cheap as spends a lot of gas. Would. Not own but just rent again. Needs to be more smooth as it is a little hard.
33, 7 months ago,5,I loved it when I rented one for a business trip a few years ago! I loved that it was a smooth drive and didn’t have any issues with it! It was great on gas and it was amazing operating it! I want to buy one one day because I fell in love with it!
34, 7 months ago,5,"I have a older model hybrid and I absolutely love this car!! It’s great on gas mileage, has plenty of room for multiple passages and I’ve taken it on several out of state trips. At almost 200 K miles and it’s still doing well. I would love to upgrade to a newer model at some point because that’s how much I love this!"
35, 7 months ago,5,"This car is big enough for 5 people family and  consumes less gas comparing with same sized car, and of course it has a good ride.   Camry is affordable, and even one of my friends sold this one with good price."
36, 7 months ago,5,"I love our highlander! It runs great and has lots of space. We purchased the limited so we could get bucket seats in the middle row. The one thing I would improve would be the electronics, we had to replace ours within the first 2 years and now it looks like it’s breaking again."
37, 7 months ago,5,"Best purchase ever! I love the style, the look, how it drives ...everything about my truck!!!"
38, 7 months ago,5,Absolutely love Toyota and me Camry. I love how it drives and looks. Get my moneys worth every time.
39, 7 months ago,5,Absolutely love my 2012 Toyota RAV! Keeping it until it runs to the ground- in another 15 years!
40, 7 months ago,5,"Using it for business andbfamily. Very convenient, has a lot of space available, could sit 8 people with a baggage space. Good quality. Relatively economical gas usage. Recommend getting it with the sunroof."
41, 7 months ago,5,"I traded in my 2014 Nissan Altima for my 2019 V6 Camry and I feel like royalty! This thing is so nice! It has everything I need and want- leather heated seats, moon roof, birds eye view cameras, all of it!! Plus the sound system is 😻"
42,7 months ago,4,I used to love this! There was so much room for everyone to fit comfortably in it! It had a good ride and I used to love the window blinds on the middle and back row seats! It would block the sun out very well!
43, 8 months ago,5,"I have a 2006 Toyota Prius. Currently has around 186K miles on it. Drives smooth, sounds great. I’ve never had any issues, just kept up on routine maintenance. I LOVE MY CAR!!!Toyota Prius"
44, 8 months ago,5,"Such an awesome little sedan. So Broome, so comfortable to ride in for long distance, Extremely durable long lasting vehicle’s. You’ll never have a problem￼Out of this vehicle."
45, 8 months ago,5,"I absolutely love Toyota Vehicles. I have had three Toyota forerunner’s. And they have been my absolute best car I’ve ever owned. They are amazing vehicles. You can run them forever without having to work on them at all for anything. Never had a mechanical issue at all ever. Great on gas. Durable, super safe, you cannot ask for a better vehicle￼"
46,8 months ago,5,I love this car I want this car #toyota rav4 I want to get this car 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
47, 8 months ago,5,"It is super spacious. Well designed!!! Only had been in for a ride, buy seems a good car to drive. I would consider buying"
48, 8 months ago,5,This was the first brand new car that I have ever owned and I absolutely love it! There are so many safety features that I really enjoy and that help me to be a safer driver. I definitely recommend this SUV!
49,8 months ago,3,"This car is a speedy little thing around and having the ability to get it hybrid is amazing, I would improve this product with its screen display to become more touch sensitive I would defiantly recommend"
50, 8 months ago,5,"I absolutely love my Rav 4 smoothest ride, great gas mileage and looks great. There are different tiers for all the bells and whistles. I have the limited and it was a great value for the price. Would totally recommend."
51, 8 months ago,4,"I love this car other than the fact that it takes to drive me.  I have the 2017 model, which I love because it has a cd player.
Pros:  monitors when you go over the lane, great on gas, purchased with two miles, and it hasn't had any problems.
Cons: It doesn't accelerate quickly; it drives you (when cruise control is on and you cross the line).  They are changing the highways where I live."
52, 8 months ago,5,I love my RAV4! It’s really spacious for a small SUV and rides well. I also really like the infotainment system!
53, 8 months ago,5,"I love my Corolla!!
I inherited it from my mom and it's almost 11 years old with less than 67,000 km
There's a few dings on the body, but it still runs beautifully
It should last me a long long time"
54, 8 months ago,5,We just got this during covid. It was great because they dropped it off to us so we could sign papers and all that. We traded in our highlander for the rav4 because we want to go off roading a little bit. So far this has worked our fantastically. The trunk has enough storage for us too. We are enjoying our new smaller suv.
55, 8 months ago,5,"I just recently leased a 2021 Toyota Highlander and I am in love! The roominess is perfect for all my things I need for my son, but I love that it still feels like an SUV rather than a van. It drives so smoothly, and the base model has some amazing features! Highly recommend!"
56, 8 months ago,5,Good car has served me well.  Not much to complain about.  It drives well and hasn’t required many repairs over the years.
57, 8 months ago,5,We have driven Toyota products since or 1981 Tercel. Including Corrolla's and now the Sienna. It is our second Sienna and we couldn't be happier. Able to seat 8 comfortably and pull our tent trailer with ease. Minimal service requirements.
58, 8 months ago,5,"Seriously the best SUV. I love that the back windows rolls down, both rows of seats (if you have 3 rows) fold flat, so much storage, easy to drive and will last you forever."
59, 8 months ago,4,I love my 2011 Toyota Camry! You can't go wrong with a Toyota they will last forever!! Rides so smooth an quiet.
60, 8 months ago,5,I own a 2015 Prius and bought it brand new. It has been a fantastic experience extremely reliable. My only complaint is how low to the ground. I hope eventually trade up for a Toyota Hybrid SUV. I don't understand the fanfare for electric vehicles this Hybrid is the best of both worlds. Love having unlimited range and affordable fill ups.
61,9 months ago,5,I love my Camry. Reliable car. Would definitely recommend. As long as you keep maintenance on it it will last a very long time.
62, 9 months ago,5,All the cars my husband buys are Toyota because they are reliable and also made in Japan. We currently owned a Toyota 4 runner. We’ve had the car for over 10 years.
63, 9 months ago,5,"This car has taken me to over 100k miles with little maintenance. Simple, and just what you need. Would love to see some more comfortable drivers seats as I spend a lot of hours in my car"
64, 9 months ago,5,"I have been using it for 2 years but it’s still working fine. Very very spacious and good function, petrol-saving and many many more. I would recommend it for a family car because it’s comfortable for both driver and sitters."
65, 9 months ago,5,"The best vehicle that I have ever owned. I know it's a minivan and it's not cool.  My Toyota Sienna SE is my family hauler.  I all love that I can fit 8 people safely. I have a family of 7 so this is a must for any big family. So you may be wondering how it handles. Surprisingly for a larger vehicle, it handles great. I bought mine new in 2011 and it's still on the road all these years later. "
66, 9 months ago,5,"The Toyota Siennais spacious The Toyota Sienna is one of the most recognizable minivans on the market. This is due in no small part to the ""Swagger Wagon"" ads that defined the last-generation model early in its life cycle. Though the quirky marketing — and Toyota's reputation for above-average reliability — helped carry the previous Sienna for nearly a decade, a new minivan would need more than a rapping family to connect with modern buyers"
67, 9 months ago,5,I have an older version of this car and it is simply great. It saves you money on gasoline. It drives smoothly. It is comfortable. It is not expensive if your looking for a newer version because it’s a Toyota. I recommend it to others.
68, 9 months ago,5,These are also gas economic.. again a lot of leg and elbow space for all 4 passengers and driver. Spacious trunk and really is a reliable car
69,9 months ago,4,"Driving experience. ... As for the transmission, this version is equipped with a CVT gearbox. In terms of handling, the Yaris offers a simple experience without much movement and with acceptable performance for a city car."
70, 9 months ago,5,"I love my 4Runner. Toyota keeps things very basic which is great...less things to break. Very comfortable to ride in long distances. The leather is durable.

Only issue I have is the back up camera has a short in the electric and doesn’t work sometimes."
71,9 months ago,3,Lots of luxuries and lots of space. Really love this SUV.  Perfect to haul the kods to soccer practice yet practical enough to take for a drive by myself without the worry of an  expensive gas bill. For a larger size SUV it gets great gas mileage and I will be purchasing the same make and model soon.
72, 9 months ago,5,We used to have Toyota Sienna . It is a very good car to drive. A family with few children it should be a good choice. Lots of space in the trunk. But some parts breaks too fast and you need to spend money for repairs.Besides it is very expensive to buy but if someone can afford it I would recommend Toyota Sienna  this car.
73, 9 months ago,5,"I love my Corolla! Dependable, low maintenance, low fuel costs, comfortable ride. Lasts forever driving well if maintenance is done properly."
74, 9 months ago,5,"This a good product, good price, lasts quite good for the family, it is quite good, lasts a long time for the whole family, for those who want to have a product that lasts a long time at home is very good."
75, 9 months ago,5,"Love love this model car!! As a begging car is great cause its small and amazing in gas!! I live out in the country and the gas tank would last me two weeks driving into town on week days for work the drive was 45 min ti and hour long. Love loved this car, wish i could get it again."
76, 9 months ago,5,La marca toyota es la marca de confianza de cualquier familia es una camioneta cómoda amblia con asientos de piel sus sistema automotriz es la mejor
77,9 months ago,3,"As far as dependability and looks I give the Celica an A+!  But for space and functionality, it was not the car for me. There is no room Whatsoever in the back seat and forget buying groceries relying on the truck to hold them. Smallest trunk space I have ever seen.  If you have children or even frequent passengers in your car, this is not your best option."
78, 9 months ago,5,"Toyotas are amazing reliable.vehicles.

My favorite thing to do is to.  Build my own all the time. And see what dreams can happen"
79,9 months ago,5,I had a Toyota Corolla for many years and loved it! Handled decently in the snow and enough space for me at the time. Didn't have any major issues with it until the end of it's life and I decided to get something bigger. I'd recommend it as a good starter car that will last a while.
80, 9 months ago,5,I have rented this vehicle Toyota RAV4  to travel a couple of times. It was very good on gas. Also it was a smooth ride.
81, 9 months ago,5,"I have had this car since 2016. Very reliable and durable. I am selling it, though, for a bigger car for my family."
82, 9 months ago,4,Energy efficient wow. My boyfriend has a 2010 Prius and the car was great for so many roadtrips. One downside is it wasn’t great in snow
83, 9 months ago,5,"The Toyota Prius is a great car! It has an engine that when your car is running but not mobile, it actually charges the car battery. That’s not it! The battery makes it so you can’t hear a sound when starting your car- the battery makes the car electric! I love that the seats fold down for extra room and the hatchback makes bringing your stuff somewhere easy. Love the sound from my iPhone playing in the radio as well! I love this car- I usually drive it like it’s a go kart or something because it hugs the road so well."
84, 9 months ago,5,Great car I love it drive nice I definitely will recommend this car to someone who is looking for a car
85, 9 months ago,5,"This baby right here is my best friend. It’s the perfect mom car, town bar, party car, mountain road car, road tripping car, quick trip car, whatever, you name it! To make it even better, I’ve ran into a ton of curbs while parking and my boyfriend has never found out because it’s sturdy af. I literally got a giant piece of metal lodged underneath the hood somehow while driving down the highway- and this thing STILL drove at near perfect condition aside from a weird noise. The Toyota Corolla ladies and gentlemen."
86, 9 months ago,4,j'aime beaucoup cette marque. Elle est très confortable et agréable à conduire. Elle a beaucoup d'options.
87, 9 months ago,5,I have used Camrys my entire driving life. My first car was one and my last car will be too. I have had only two cars not a Camry and I was happy to get my baby back. They have saved my life at least 2 times so far that alone is worth it. I am not happy its been totaled out twice when someone tired to push me off the road which is common here where I live sadly. When they do the Camry protected me and I was able to walk away both times which paramedics were shocked I was able to. Just dont sit too close to the wheel. the airbags pop out and are known to break your face and bust your teeth out. I was spared my face but lost a tooth. That was costly and unexpected. I will always buy Toyota and always recommend it to everyone. Reliable car. Amazing. 
88, 9 months ago,5,"The Toyota Camry is a great car. This car is very safe and fun to drive. I was very impressed with the ease of the cars driving. The gas mileage was outstanding and I would definitely own another one and I highly recommend this car to my family and friends, as a matter of fact I recommend this car to everyone that needs and wants a very dependable lasting car!"
89, 9 months ago,5,"Love my car so much, I bought is brand new in 2017 and it's still in awesome condition. Heated seats/steering wheel. Only thing it's lacking is cooling seats, would be so much better in summer time!! I got the color purple, I love it! Haha although the stitching inside the car is orange... like why, I'm going to change it. I've never had anything wrong with the vehicle at all, works amazing."
90, 9 months ago,5,Loved our Toyota Camry!! Was a hand me down from my aunt-we used it for about five years-by then the car was almost 20 years old!! Passed it onto a friend when we got our Honda Odyssey. She’s still going strong!!  Love Toyota’s.
91, 9 months ago,4,"I love Toyota! They have great customer service and the cars are durable, gas efficient, very up to date on technology and have a sleek modern look."
92, 9 months ago,5,I have a 2009 Rav 4. Her name is Shelly and she has about 200k miles on her. We’ve been through a lot together and she’s been a very reliable girly.
93, 9 months ago,5,"I love my 4 runner!!  It’s fun to drive!! I bought big tires, fancy rims, tinted the windows, running boards and other accessories have made it very sharp looking!! I get compliments daily ❤️"
94, 9 months ago,5,"Este auto me encanta, es súper a todo terreno  y la verdad el espacio es extraordinario  en mi familia funciona muy bien ya que somos 5."
95, 9 months ago,5,"Our Toyota 4Runner was purchased over ten years ago and still runs like it did on day one. It provides a ton of space for family trips, while maintaining a very smooth drive. I have felt quite uncomfortable driving larger or too-heavy vehicles in the past, but this SUV handles just as well as our sedan."
96, 9 months ago,5,"Our Toyota Prius has been such a wonderful purchase. The gas/electric hybrid saves us a ton on fuel costs, and the car drives like a dream, especially on long road trips."
97, 9 months ago,5,Es muy buen carro  me encanta esta marca son muy buenos y duran mucho casi no nesecito mucho pata reparar so lo nesezario
98, 9 months ago,5,"Loved it. Had it for over 10 years and 300,000 miles! They last forever with proper maintenance."
99, 9 months ago,5,I have replaced a lot on it and it seems to be better after putting 20000 miles on it in 7 months! I drive it a lot and it never causes me any problems!
100, 9 months ago,4,I do not personally own this vehicle but I have rented one. It’s small but comfy and nice. Good on gas!
101, 9 months ago,4,I do not personally own this vehicle but I have several friends that do and I have rented one. It’s nice but there are similar competitor SUVs that ride more smooth and are more comfortable.
102, 9 months ago,5,Beautiful car! I do not personally own one but I have several friends that do and I have been in them. Rides well. Comfortable.
103, 9 months ago,5,Rides great for a 2007 and when you do the up keep the car will last you a long time. My husband maintains his car and does everything he needs to. Great on gas.
104, 9 months ago,2,"It’s ok. I purchased new 2012 Corolla and it drove very smoothly. I liked the comfortable feeling and the amount of space inside the vehicle. The downside is that on the second year of my ownership the trim around the front tire started poking out. Not only was it just my vehicle, I saw a few others with the same issue. They are not the best built but they run really good."
105, 9 months ago,5,This has been our favorite vehicle purchase.  The only issue we have is the third row is smaller and not as comfortable for longer rides.  Toyota Highlander
106, 9 months ago,5,"I love my Toyota Prius! Great on mileage and has a comfy interior. The exterior has slick lines, backup camera and so many bells and whistles. This car is worth it’s price, you will save so much in gas money and with ￼maintenance."
107, 9 months ago,5,My dad and stepmom have a Highlander. It is very comfortable and has a roomy back seat. Lots of trunk space.
108, 9 months ago,5,We absolutely love this car. Very comfortable to drive. My family of 4 fits very comfortably. We got one with a third row of seats which is great when my kids have friends riding with us. But just like most 3 row SUVs there is very little trunk room when the 3rd row is up.
109, 9 months ago,5,"Not a lot of road noise, has a back up camera, and comes with Sirius radio. Smooth driving and comfortable."
110, 9 months ago,5,"Love my matrix! This thing is a tank and I will keep it until it is unfixable. It’s comfortable, plenty of space, very efficient on gas and minimal upkeep needed."
111, 9 months ago,5,Miss my Camry had great trunk space and was a cozy drive. Had great gas mileage and ran like a champ never had any problems

Love it. Highly recommended for family car ( Toyota Camry Grande 2012)"
115, 9 months ago,5,This is the second Toyota I’ve owned and never have had any issues with the car at all. I have the Corolla sport and get great gas mileage. All the perks and the customer service is always been over the top. Thank you Toyota Corolla
116, 9 months ago,5,Love my Camry. It's good on gas. Has a lot of leg room. Comfortable seating. It's a great family car for a mom of boys. It has the heated seats which i love in this cold -10 weather. Heats up fast too. Needs a little weight in the trunk on snowy days.
117, 9 months ago,4,Toyota Highlander has been a good fit for us with 2 car seats. We wanted the 3rd car seat to work in the last row but it really doesn’t work well.
118,9 months ago,5,The Toyota Corolla was my first car. It’s a great car to start very safe and efficient. Absolutely love having cruise control and sensors it really made a difference on the road.
119, 9 months ago,5,"I would say Toyota is a great brand for car, it lasts a long time, very easy to drive, compact, their nice looking cars  inhave to say I will always buy Toyota"
120, 9 months ago,5,I absolutely LOVE my 4 Runner. Best choice I ever made. It is exactly what I was looking for and hundred percent my style. The only thing it is missing is a heated steering wheel.

125, 9 months ago,5,I love my Camry it’s the absolute perfect little family vehicle however one day I’d like to upgrade to the 4 runner for my family it’s been my dream car since before I was old enough to drive
126, 9 months ago,5,"Es un auto súper cómodo,😊 solo tenemos 3 años para comprarlo, todavía no tengo quejas al respecto.Lo recomiendo y más obviamente por el marcq Toyota es una marca reconocida en autos y eso es importante para comprar siempre lo mejor. Love ❤️"
127, 9 months ago,4,"My car is a hybrid, and as expected the gas mileage is great. I have had some issues with the tires losing air a lot, but it is an older car, 2007. It also is not as practical in the Chicago winters, but at other times it is great."
128, 9 months ago,5,My son owns a Toyota Camry in their beautiful color Blue.  It is fuel efficient and a very comfortable ride.  
129, 9 months ago,5,I've had my Toyota Highlander for a couple of years.  I have been pleased with every aspect of it.  I have it serviced regularly and plan for it to last me for a very long time.
130, 9 months ago,4,We use this vehicle for commuting purposes and it’s reliable. It does well on gas and doesn’t take a lot to fill up. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a good commuting vehicle.

132, 9 months ago,5,I must say Toyotas are very reliable I’m happy to have a highlander very spacious. I recommend a Toyota to every friend that ask me what type of car or truck they should get and I hands down say. Get yourself a Toyota your not going to regret it!!!
133, 9 months ago,4,Decent  vehicle .  Good  in  the  snow and  rain .   Nice 6  speed  transmission .  Quiet .  TONS  of  room .  Sits  high .   Had  no  issues  with  it  except  changing  the  oil and  spark  plugs.   Only  issues  is  it  it's  tippy  and  plays  turtle ... downside   Hard  to  find  a  good manual  trans  with  low  KM .
134, 9 months ago,5,A good car that has an understandable price. This car is really low on fuel consumption and it handles really good. A car that perfect for learner and also for a small daily that can take your family from A to B safely
135, 9 months ago,3,Very attractive but rides rough. For traveling long distance I wouldn’t choose this. Definitely a sporty vehicle
136, 9 months ago,5,So comfortable drives so smooth and roomy inside and trunk. I used to have a camry and I loved it. You can put so many miles on it as lobg as you maintain it!
137, 9 months ago,4,I really like the midsize suv that can sit 6-7 people. This car drives smooth and it has a sleek design. It’s a great family car with good style.
138, 9 months ago,4,"I owned a Toyota Camary back in 2007.  The vehicle was pretty affordable and very spacious.  This absolutely needed at the time as I wanted my daughter to be comfortable in the backseat.  While I haven't driven a Toyota in several years, it is a car that I would highly recommend."
139, 9 months ago,5,My mother actually owns this car and she absolutely loves it! Personally I like it a lot too! It’s great in the snow also which is important
140, 9 months ago,5,"Great commuter, great fuel mileage   Sporty, I didn’t like how the screen set above the dash"
141, 9 months ago,5,"I love my 2020 hybrid Camry. This is not my first Camry, but it is my first hybrid. I love the comfort of this car"

143, 9 months ago,5,"I love my mini van swagger wagon! It came highly rated on consumer reports for safety and performance, plus has a lot of added bonuses that really fit our family."
144, 9 months ago,5,This car is amazing one of my favorite cars definitely have been sticking to Toyota’s they are best on gas and price

146,9 months ago,5,"Wow toyota corolla, es sueño de todas creo yo,, al menos el mio,, sería un sueño tener esta maravilla es muy hermoso yo recomiendo  Toyota Corolla"
147, 9 months ago,5,My car is a 2016 Toyota Corolla. I bought this car while in college. It’s great on gas and easy to maintain. It has deep trunk space and has room for a donut spare tire.
148,9 months ago,5,I love my Camry! Incredibly reliable!! Never had any issues with my car! It’s a great all around vehicle to own.
149, 9 months ago,5,I was a passenger but it drove nice. Almost bought one myself but I am a chev girl. It was an older model but still was nice.
150,9 months ago,5,"I love my Toyota Rav 4. Mine is the older version so it doesn’t look like this picture. It’s the only car I’ve ever had but it works amazing! Hopefully one day, I’ll have the money to buy a newer Rav 4."
151, 9 months ago,5,"It is one of the safest cars for the family, I also feel that I can use it safely comfortable comfortable economic it is a luxury"
152,9 months ago,3,"It is okayish car,in my opinion. I dont like the pickup at all . It gives good milage and newer version has all wheel which is a plus. But overall not the best driving experience. We opted for it as it was an affordable option. Toyota Camry"
153,9 months ago,5,"Great car to drive, it just kept on going. Hardly had any trouble with it. By the time we traded it in it had done over 300,000 kilometres"
154, 9 months ago,4,The toyota 4runner is a great car for families with more than one child for lots of room an comfort. good for rougher weather
155, 9 months ago,5,My grandmother had this car when i was a kid. I remember it was very comfortable and did had deep problems. Toyota is a very good brand
156, 9 months ago,5,"This was my previous car to my dream current car, my Jeep.  My Rav was dependable, never had a single issue. Had good pick up. All the techy bells and whistles which I miss with my Jeep. All in all by far one of my favorite cars I’ve owned"
157, 9 months ago,4,It's a heavy vehicle to drive in but very spacious with lots of room. Big boy SUV style with a splash of luxury with the interior features
158,9 months ago,5,"I love my 4runner, so much so that I’m in my 4th one! Also, just found it’s so much fast because it’s 2wd. See the photo below! Who said you need 4wd in the snow 😂"
159, 9 months ago,4,All in all I haven’t had any problem with my car. Maintenance is all up to date. Recalls where also updated. Not very expensive to get fix and very manageable for the most part only thing I don’t enjoy is driving it when it’s raining or windy since my car feels light.
160, 9 months ago,4,The new models are beautiful cars. Downfall to me was the blind sport. It’s difficult to see your blind sport with how the back window is
161, 9 months ago,5,Such a fun smooth car to drive. From daily driving to off-roading. The gas mileage is not bad for being a 4wheel drive.
162, 9 months ago,5,Will never buy another car outside of Toyota again. Amazing car and amazing fuel mileage.
163, 9 months ago,5,Will never buy another car outside of Toyota. I love my cars and they last forever. Great room in the back seat.
164, 9 months ago,5,Love the new model Camry cars starting to look more sporty every model that drops. Eco friendly as well
165, 9 months ago,5,"Best car I’ve owned. I only had one minor issue with it, it’s a 2011 the only issue I’ve had was paint chipping but Toyota has fixed it fully paid for. Drives great, really good gas mileage too, I fill up once a week and lasts me all week. It’s cute and very reliable exactly what I need. Back seats are a little cramped but I don’t drive people around much so hasn’t been an issue. Trunk has a good amount of space too, I have a 10” sub and a car organizer and I am still able to fit a large suitcase in there."
166, 9 months ago,5,I love the Toyota 4 runner!  It could get better gas mileage but for the size it’s ok
167, 9 months ago,5,"I love my Highlander, so much so, that once this one dies, I’ll buy another.  My favorite car of all time.  The ride is so smooth, and I love all the bells and whistles it has.  The best!!"
168, 9 months ago,5,"If you have a family, this is the car for you! My dad has a 4Runner but I've borrowed it a few times. It has enough space to haul lumber, tables, etc, and 5 grown adults can easily fit within it. He always gets one with 4WD and I've been through sand dunes in this vehicle. This isn't my dad's first 4Runner and the resale value on these cars are great over time. When I drive it, I feel high up and have great visualization, which is important since I'm a petite woman. I am definitely planning on getting one of these when I have my own family some day."
169, 9 months ago,5,My family has always had Toyotas and this car is great! I bought it when I lived in Alaska and it got me safely through some scary winter driving (I have a Limited AWD). It has a lot of cargo space and that was extremely useful when I moved across the country. I've had my Rav4 for about 4 years and I haven't had any major issues with it. I highly recommend a Rav4 if you're looking for a well-made crossover that will last a long time.
170,9 months ago,5,"The 2020 Toyota Corolla has a new design that attracts more, much of its safety technology is included in all models and it is a very reliable car. It is compatible with Apple CarPlay. The Bad It does not have Android Auto compatibility and its infotainment system leaves something to be desired."
171,9 months ago,5,"The 2020 Toyota Sequoia Platinum is a truck that feels powerful as soon as we hit the gas. Its V8 engine with 381 horsepower and 401 lb.-ft. of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, has no problem moving the more than 2.5 tons it weighs naturally."
172,9 months ago,5,"receives in its 2020 model a more complete equipment that includes new technological accessories, essentially in connectivity. On the mechanics there are no variations. Renowned for being the most efficient and capable off-road, it urgently required this upgrade to meet the demands of the US market, while a relief arrives."
173, 9 months ago,3,Drove nice but not alot of room inside  Nice looking pro      good brand reputation    nice lookingCon     not really roomy  
174, 9 months ago,2,I do not like this car at all don't like the drive don't like anything about it I would never buy one they ride hard
175, 9 months ago,4,I think these will never go out of style I love them. Reliable and fun and great to drive!
176, 9 months ago,4,I love my Corolla. I feel safe with my son riding in my car and that is the most important to me. I also love the backup camera feature.
177, 9 months ago,5,Omg! I buy this car last year and I hate cars they so small but my Toyota is really good car i have kids and I have good room for my kids car seats 100% I save gas with this car no problems easy also I have good room for me because im tall! My legs is tall so is perfect 👌 if you like to save money gas have a nice car you can buy this
178, 9 months ago,5,"I don't even know what to say. I don't know anything about cars, the only use I give them is as a passenger usually on Uber or other rideshare apps, I think these are comfortable and... drive well? I have no idea. They look nice, at least, but I don't really have an opinion. The only thing I would add is that these might be uncomfortable for taller people."
179, 9 months ago,5,"I don't even know what to say. I don't know anything about cars, the only use I give them is as a passenger usually on Uber or other rideshare apps, I think these are comfortable and... drive well? I have no idea. They look nice, at least, but I don't really have an opinion."
180,10 months ago,4,"Toyota Prius 2014 is good car, got it from work. Quiet as all hybrids, modern, automatic, great steering wheel, in good shape, easy to drive, front and rear views what needed. One minus of this car - it is made from plastic. Doors, dashbord etc. Little scratch and no more fancy look."
181,10 months ago,2,"Car is good by itself - big, beautiful, a lot of space, roarrring well. But a lot of manufactures breakages that even in salon they can not fixed. Whaaaat?! Why?! Definetly I would not recommend model Corolla of Toyola. Complite money eater."
182, 10 months ago,4,I loved my old prius. It has a long life as is general with brands like Toyota if it is given the proper maintenance. Great on gas and very easy to maneuver due to its compact size. The only downside is that it can be less comfortable for overly long trips.
183,10 months ago,4,"We recently bought the 2020 RAV4 Limited. In terms of the bells and whistles, it has pretty much everything. A few things though to note: 1) it doesn’t have panoramic moonroof, which is very surprising considering the competition and that this is a limited version. 2) it doesn’t have the automatic side mirrors folding feature, again surprising for it being a limited and paying top dollar for it. Should be standard at this point. 3) it has its own specific extension cord attachment for the block heater, which is cool and all but I see it as just an extra premium cost if it’s damaged/lost/stolen. Also if you ever forget to detach it before driving away then the whole front fender is damaged...and again you have to get everything replaced and fixed, and you guessed it for top dollar just to repair it (happened to us actually ha *facepalm*). I would suggest that they convert it to some magnetic version like how Apple MacBooks do it. Don’t think that technology is available for outdoor extension cords but one can only dream ha. Otherwise this vehicle is solid! Though don’t look for a lot of power, I find it revs too high for too long when in sport mode and it doesn’t give you much power. But that’s just me. No other issues with this vehicle."
184, 10 months ago,5,Love my car. It has pretty easy to use features and is very roomy. There is plenty of space for traveling or moving things and purchases locally. I have the Rav 4 hybrid so the gas mileage and filling up is not too bad. I love the features to protect the car from salt damage from living in snowy areas and it has overall good handling for driving in wet conditions.
185,10 months ago,5,"I drive a 2007 Toyota 4Runner limited V6. And I will say I looovveee this vehicle. I know it’s old and doesn’t have all the nice bells and whistles of the newer 4Runners but I will argue that the 4th gen 4Runners are the best. It’s very very reliable. I live up in Canada with it’s super cold winters, and have never had problems with it. The 4x4 works great when I need it. This is a part-time 4x4 so some people might not like that, and it drives rear-wheel when not in 4x4. It’ll take some time to get used to it if you’ve never driven one especially during winter. What I also like about this vehicle is that it has a timing chain, not a drive belt that the full time 4x4 V8 engines run on. Makes it even more reliable in my opinion. If you’re looking for a solid “beater”, though it’s hardly a beater, I would definitely recommend this vehicle. It’s also been known to run as long as ~600,000km. As long as you take good care of it properly it can last you a long time. Best bang for you buck!"
186, 10 months ago,5,I love my Toyota Camry. It rides so smooth and is excellent on gas. This car will last for a long time. I plan on letting my daughter have it when she turns 16 in 3 years then I will upgrade to a newer model
187, 10 months ago,5,love love love my camry. it is such a great car and doesn’t die. it also is the perfect size for almost anything. one of the best brands of cars
188, 10 months ago,4,"This car was wonderful wgen it came to driving, and the look, it unfortunately cost a bundle to fill up, and it cost if you ever needed to put it in the shop. They are about midrange, depends on what type you get, i would recommend due to they last for a long time and really are great riding vehicles. I would definitely own another one."
189, 10 months ago,5,"My husband drove this car for a bit and it was a very nice vehicle. It got great gas mileage on a road trip that we went on, and the passenger seat was very comfortable during the long travel. The telescoping arm rest/center console was our favorite past."
190, 10 months ago,5,"We got this car as we were preparing for baby number two. It's super spacious and is perfect for both car seats and the boot space is also quite generous and can fit a pram, stroller and shopping!
I feel super safe in it as it has lane and break warnings, as well as a 360 degree camera view. 
It's easy to drive and is nice and high. It's super fuel efficient which is the best thing and the lights automatically turn on when it gets dark."
191, 10 months ago,5,"This is my baby!!! Love it!
Affordable on gas. Super efficient and cute.
Small and very durable ❤️ love it"
192,10 months ago,4,"Kept this vehicle for 28 yrs. car is outstanding- no rust on body, no issues except the local Toyota service department is absolutely awful. People drive any distance to avoid the local Toyota service dept"
193, 10 months ago,4,It’s an old car but it’s working good at this time thanks to God I have a car to go to work
194, 10 months ago,5,I LOVE my 2020 RAV4. It drives incredibly smooth and is extremely comfortable. There is plenty of space with two car seats and the back has enough space for our large double stroller with room to spare. It drives great through all seasons and does well in the snow. Gas mileage is good too. Overall beautiful vehicle and perfect for a family car.
195, 10 months ago,5,Toyota's are really nice cars. I drove my cousins and it was a super smooth drive. The seats were a little hard on my back but it's not the car. I had back surgery so it's hard to find a car that sits well. I loved all the gadgets she has in her car.
196, 10 months ago,5,Love the sporty Toyota Camry 4 Doors. Like the sleek look of the car on the road. Great gas mileage and smooth drive.
197, 10 months ago,5,"I like it is big and the color is elegant Practical and reliable, the Toyota Matrix is a Practicality reigns here, with very easy access, a roomy rear seat and a large and flat load floor, once the rear seats are folded."
198, 10 months ago,5,It’s a nice car It’s I feel comfortable driving this car. I can’t do anything without a car  it is part of my life. I relax recommend this car because doesn’t use so much Gas and compared with other brands for this one is the best .
199, 10 months ago,5,I have a 2007 highlander hybrid and I love it! It’s given me almost no trouble (knock on wood) in all these years! Just a battery replacement every few years.
200, 10 months ago,5,Love my Camry!  Will purchase another Camry in the future! Very reliable vehicle.  Easy to maintain and affordable maintenance if needed!
201,10 months ago,5,"Mom of three here! Had to jump on the swagger wagon trend and get one for my growing family!  I hated it at first. I refused to learn any gadgets in the thing.. to the point where I didn’t even know how to pop open the gas tank! Haha! 

But let’s be real, it’s the easiest thing for 3 kiddos. The space, the cup holders, the room for shopping trips.. and the trunk.. have you seen how deep the trunk is?! You guys. As much as I wanted to hate it forever, it’s growing on me... I love all of the safety features it comes with, the sliding doors stop and go back if it senses or touches anything as it’s closing. 

My only complaint ( other than it’s a mini van) is that I have to choose having the 8th seat or all wheel drive. I wish I could have both. 

Other than that, if you’re  searching for a good reliable Minivan for your growing family, give it a test ride. You’ll be presently surprised at how smooth of a drive you have!!"
202, 10 months ago,5,"I never drive a Toyota Camry, but I like this brand. More affordable, and adequate to my family. I woulld like to have one."
203, 10 months ago,5,"I drove a Toyota Celica 30 years ago and it was very fashion! It was so easy to drive, very compact (it was for 2 people), but it belonged to my friend. So it was only few times. Yes, it was expensive.  "
204, 10 months ago,4,Toyota’s are very nice low end cars. They look nice and drive well! They are similar to Honda Civics. I would also recommend this as a first car because it is cheaper than most and gets the job done.
205, 10 months ago,5,My aunt owns this car and I have to say it is a nice smooth ride. Its a nice size sedan and the price is awesome for the value. Its nice looking and will definitely be a classic.
206, 10 months ago,5,My pregnant niece owns this vehicle and it is nice and steady and sturdy for her. It has all the best amenities. A little pricey but overall good value. All Toyota vehicles are great value!
207, 10 months ago,5,Love my Toyota! Great gas mileage and easy to afford any maintenance. I would recommend Toyota for any first time drivers especially freshman in college
208, 10 months ago,4,"Used this car when I first began driving for driving school. Overall an okay, basic car. Seems pretty reliable and safe. Not a fan of the looks but seems to be affordable and good on gas. Personally wouldn’t purchase myself but I see the appeal. "
209, 10 months ago,4,"Cute car, a smidge too small for me personally but a good small suv. I could see this being a good first suv for someone"
210, 10 months ago,5,Really great car we had it for 8+ years drove it cross country had it for 2 more years after that and then the transmission gave out.  It was a good durable car. Great on gas as well.
211, 10 months ago,5,"Great car. Easy to drive, reliable, great gas mileage. This car definitely holds it’s value."
212, 10 months ago,4,"The sport version its a joke, the motor is too small for a heavy car like this one. Doesn’t develop that fast in freeways. Besides that, Its a city car super reliable."
213, 10 months ago,5,"Reliable, its a must buy for every soccer mom or dad with tons of kids, or at least a big family. Every passenger can travel with confort and at the same time create good memories. Fuel efficient too and powerful. Looks aren’t fancy but its ok."
214, 10 months ago,5,"Powerful, comfortable incredible for off road trips in the desert, trunk is big enough for camping equipment, needs more modern features but basics are reliable enough."
215, 10 months ago,5,Lets say its perfect for someone looking for basics. Its small yes but fuel efficient confortable for the driver not for passengers in the back. Trunk is spacious. Perfect for road trips. And not too much noise at high speeds. Love it.
216, 10 months ago,5,"My first car was a Corolla and I drove it into the ground. I loved it, it was a perfect first car.
Comfortable and cheap to maintain."
217, 10 months ago,5,We have owned Toyota’s since 1999 and have had great experiences. Our 2007 Sequoia had 300k miles when we traded it in 2 weeks ago.
218, 10 months ago,5,I own the 2005 and i love my car so much. its so cute and spacious and will last forever. i wouldn't want anything else
219, 10 months ago,4,As a passenger I found this car very comfortable. It had a lot of optional extras mez it drove smoothly and very easy to switch between gears. The air conditioning and heating worked great and the style of the dashboard was sleek and well set out
220, 10 months ago,5,"I got my RAV 4 last year & it’s definitely one of the safest cars. I have a sun roof which makes the drives so much more fun. I love how there is heating in the steering wheel and seats which is so helpful during the cold days. You can start your car with your keys or simply using your phone. I have my lane assist on & when you go towards a white line, it will push you to the middle. If you’re looking for a safe & reliable car, I highly recommend this car!!"
221,10 months ago,5,"I drive a 2005 Toyota Camry and absolutely love my car. I owned a Toyota Prius and after a few months of owning it and putting in a brand new battery and brand new tires, it died while I was in the middle of the road at a stoplight. I have had this car for almost a year now and it is my best car purchase. It is reliable and not too expensive to own. It has never failed me. This is solely my experience, but I have had such a great experience with this car. It is not a gas guzzler nor an oil guzzler. Just take care of your car in all weather conditions and it should work well!  Toyota Camry Toyota Motor Company  "
222, 10 months ago,5,"One of my favorite SUVS out there, I worked on a Ford car lot, but 4Runners we're always my absolute favorite vehicles to demo and bring in for customers.  They drive more rugged like a truck, but handle still smoothly.  The interior could use a revamp, most specifically, the shifter feels cheap.  But if you can look passed that, it is an amazing vehicle.  Resale for these don't go down by much, you might lose 10 grand after 7 years and 200,000km (which is unheard of)."
223, 10 months ago,5,"Great car! Affordable, but still comes with a ton of bells and whistles! It’s reliable and just keeps going!"

227, 10 months ago,4,"The cloth interior is comfortable and adequate for long car trips, something this car is more than capable of. The suspension provides a smooth ride although as an older car the gas mileage suffers a bit. Overall would recommend as a daily driver Vehicle"
228, 10 months ago,5,"For a car that’s production dates decades ago, the reliability and comfort of this model cannot be understated! I purchased a 2000 Toyota Camry at around 100k miles. Besides regular maintenance and washing I’ve had no problems with the automobile. While the acceleration won’t match a modern sports car, the V6 engine installed was made for longevity; the quiet hum of the engine when idling and accelerating is proof enough."

230,10 months ago,4,"Im Allgemeinen macht so ein hybrid schon Sinn. Im Großen und Ganzen ist es zu gefährlich nur mit Strom angetrieben zu fahren....so(te man liegen bleiben kann keiner mal strom im Kanister mitbringen. Also ich freu mich das der Yaris von Toyota da auch die Benzin Variante hat. Alles in allem ein schönes Auto aber bei der Technik im Handybereich gab es Probleme. Die Mikros waren zu leise eingestellt und ließen sich auch in der Vertragswerkstatt nicht lauter justieren, da die Lautstärke wieder in den alten Modus zurück fielen.

In general, such a hybrid makes sense.  On the whole, it is too dangerous to drive only with electricity .... so (if you stay where you are, no one can bring electricity in the canister. So I'm happy that the Yaris from Toyota also has the petrol variant  All in all a nice car, but there were problems with the technology in the cellphone area: the microphones were set too quietly and could not be adjusted louder even in the authorized workshop, as the volume fell back to the old mode."
231, 10 months ago,4,This car great - I kept up with oil changes and it lasted me quite sometime. I traded it in for a new car. Toyota is a good brand in my opinion.
232, 10 months ago,5,"I have the 2016 and it is hands down by far my favorite vehicle. In the first 4 years I owned it, I put a LOT (110k) of miles on - I drove for work and lived a few states from family. I have never had an issue with it- it runs like the day I bought it and the gas milage is astounding. 50+mpg. The only downside is the audio system user interface, but that’s not a dealbreaker for me."

239, 10 months ago,4,A friend of mine had a Toyota Camry that had over 300K miles on it. I can honestly say that this was one of the most reliable and economical cars I have seen. The gas mileage on these vehicles is really incredible too.

243, 10 months ago,4,"I love my Toyota Camry Hybrid. I've had her since 2016 and no major problems which is a blessing. Toyota's are some of the most durable cars that will last you for a long time as long as you take care of it. It's not expensive to maintain, just avoid going to the dealership for maintenance work because they will over charge you for simple things. The body of the car isn't the most durable because they honestly don't make cars out of strong material anymore. I got a dent in my bumper once and my husband was easily able to take it off and pop the dent out. Overall would recommend and most likely my next car will also be a Toyota."
244, 10 months ago,5,My Dad had this car for a period of time and it was very nice and roomy. It drove really well and it could hold a lot of adults.
245, 10 months ago,2,Its a good car but mine is a 2006 and the airbag light is on.  Trying to get it in to the dealer has been a nightmare considering there's a recall on it.

250, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Toyota Corolla so much that I am reluctant to start looking for another car in the future (I currently drive an older model from the early 2000's). I will definitely consider a corolla again when I have to start looking, and will consider Toyota if I decide to upgrade to an SUV."

259, 10 months ago,5,"Love my Toyota Corolla! No complaints. Great safety features. Easy and comfortable to drive. Gets great gas mileage. Only con is that it could be too small for some people, a great car for the price. I would highly recommend especially for those that commute a lot. "
260,10 months ago,4,My family loved the heated and cooled seats (my favorite was definitely the cooling!). Not a lot of cargo space though. I thought the 4Runners were pretty pricey brand new (especially for the available options). Reliable vehicles though.
261, 10 months ago,2,Nope. Not a fan. I got this car thinking I would be an adult with a big car to move furniture or when I had kids. And I ended up getting into two fender benders within 6 months. I am short so even with the seat as high up and far forward as it would go I couldn't see ANYTHING. Not a fan. Sold it as soon as I could.
262, 10 months ago,5,10/10 my favorite car everrrr!!! This was my first car when learning how to drive and I just felt so safe and like I could see everything even though I'm so short! It did move around on the highway when it was windy so be careful but other than that it was great!

268, 10 months ago,4,Toyota makes a good product. Its engine is built for longevity. Its a bit noisy but it is an older vehicle so im unsure how quiet the new model is. Put in a better quality seats. Its affordable

274, 10 months ago,4,"This is my daily driver. Let start by saying this is a fun little car and love it! Now, 6 months after I purchased this car, I was t-boned and it hasn’t  run the same ever since. This car is tiny so that means any little accident is a major one, like driving a tin can. Unfortunately, this car has cost me a lot of money in repairs and just didn’t recover from the first accident."
275, 10 months ago,5,One of our favorite cars we have owned. It was a bit of a gas guzzler however the ride was worth it. We could go anywhere in our 4 runner.
276, 10 months ago,5,I loved my Toyota Camry. It rode really smoothly and lasted me quite some time without tons of repairs. A great safe car.
277, 10 months ago,3,I've been in older versions and newer versions of the Rav4. I did NOT like the older ones but the newer models are much better.
278, 10 months ago,5,I've owned A LOT of cars and this one is just....ugh I don't don't know how to describe how much I love it! It's gorgeous to look at inside and out. It drives smoothly and is just an all around pleasure
279, 10 months ago,3,"While this car is roomy and ok on fas, it is the heaviest most clunky car I’ve driven! You can feel every single bump, you have to seriously press the gas hard to get it going on takeoff. Would never purchase again."
280, 10 months ago,4,"Very good on gas, a little wobbly at certain speeds. A really good road trip car. But only carry all bags."

284, 10 months ago,3,"Nice car. Toyota's are always super reliable. Roomy, easy to drive and cheap to maintain and keep. Petrol mileage is also very good. Boot/trunk space is amazing, can conveniently fit half of ikea in the back of the Camry which is deceptive. Decent car. "
285, 10 months ago,5,Excellent mileage. Toyotas team is awesome if you need any help. Also very smooth to drive
286, 10 months ago,5,Best suv on the market by a long shot. Good mileage. Smooth to drive. Toyota also has excellent warranty
287, 10 months ago,5,"I have had my Toyota since 2006, and it’s definitely the most reliable car that my family has used. They are reliable and reasonable cars."
288, 10 months ago,4,I have a 2013 Toyota Corolla LE. I think it’s a decent car. It has pretty good gas miles in town. It’s comfortable enough for me I think if you’re 6’3” + you’ll have a hard time driving and fitting into it. Gets from A-to-B safety.
289,10 months ago,5,"This was my first car. A great car to learn in and super reliable, the car was a 98 model but drove so well for its age!"
290, 10 months ago,5,Me gusta mucho este tipo de Toyota. Yo lo manejo y es súper practico estable y ahorrador de gasolina.
291, 10 months ago,5,Es un auto muy practico para cambiarle sus piezas y fácil de conseguir. Es un carro de larga vida ahorrador de gasolina confiable y seguro.
292, 10 months ago,5,"Excellent vehicle. It's cute, not too small and the engine gets up. You wouldn't think that the 4 cylinder would do the best job for the almost mid sized vehicle but it does. And no lagging, she gets up and goes! It comes with theft protection and the key has the alarm, trunk open and door open buttons. The vehicle has the screen for reversing, to make sure there isn't anyone behind you and it's touchscreen for the radio and other options. You can also do everything from your steering wheel!. It's roomy and comfortable, great on gas too! Trunk room is great, plus the seats go down in the back also. I have the door protectors, but I have the LE. There are several sensors in this vehicle that help give you a safer experience. Example, when my tires are low on air, I get a notification in the dashboard. Or when it's time for an oil change, it lights up the dash as well. These are great extras that Toyota has put in the vehicle. Oh and the A/C is awesome! Super cold which is a huge must in Florida! If you get the S series which I really wanted but was unavailable in the color I wanted, you will receive nice rims not hubcaps. It's a really affordable vehicle that will last you a very long time. Keep your oil changes up, it will keep your vehicle running great for even longer. Toyota Corolla"
293, 10 months ago,4,Love my 2019 HYBRID Toyota Rav 4. It was great on gas and I can usually drive to work for over a week on one tank! I live an hour away from my job so I commute very far each day! vehicle is great for weekend trips away and for camping. We took this vehicle camping last summer and fit everything from our tent to our blow up mattress to our two bikes inside the vehicle! It is perfect for families and for those of you who want to be environmentally friendly but aren't able to purchase a fully electric vehicle. The only problem I have with the Rav is that the seats are highly uncomfortable. after about an hour my butt and my back a bit sore. But overall I love this vehicle!
294, 10 months ago,5,"Great car. I’ve had it for 6 years now and has never really giving me any problems. Just the usual, flat tire and dead battery but those things happen to every car"
295, 10 months ago,4,Had this car in college. Cute and compact. The new ones seem to have more space. It was great for the time and my age.
296, 10 months ago,5,"I have the Camry Le and she is the best car I’ve ever purchased! I get about 30-32mpg so I only fill up with gas once a week. Toyota has the lowest maintenance costs on the market. As long as you keep up with your routine maintenance on these they can and will last you a long time. My grandparents had one with over 200k miles on it and still ran like a champ. I love my Toyota Camry, she has been so good to me."
297, 10 months ago,5,Omg of all toyota vehicle this is my favorite. Its beyond roomy. Turns like a small car. Works great in all weather conditions what would make this vehicle is if it was a 6 cylinder. Gas can be costly as the per mile you will not get your money's worth. But you don't but a large suv for great gas mileage test drive one you will love it #toyota #suv
298, 10 months ago,5,"I love my toyota prius! It gets great gas mileage and I love that the seats fold down and it has a hatchback. It can transport so much! If I could change the car layout of the 2015, I would remove the center placement of the dash, and the divider in the center console."
299, 10 months ago,5,I’ve owned 2 Corollas and they are the best mid size cars! They just have this get-up-and-go feeling like they just want to drive! They are super safe cars and ride like a dream. Great for short trips or long ones. Highly recommend.
300,10 months ago,5,"This is my first time owning a Toyota Corolla and I’m in love! I love the blind spot monitor, this is a definite plus point for me, I like the lane assist, a few times,the car would beep telling me I’m touching the line and would steer me center. My favorite is the Apple Play, I use GPS very frequently and I like the fact that the map is displayed on the monitor, no more looking down at my phone for directions, I can see it easily and stay focused on my driving. First time owning a car with keyless unlocking and I love it! The days where I would lose my keys in my bag and spend 2-3 minutes looking for them are long gone! Now with my keys in my bag, I just have to touch the door handle and the car unlocks! Toyota Corolla is a very good choice of car, the driving is smooth and I feel safe."
301, 10 months ago,4,My sister actually just bought a rav4 and loves it! It’s so cute and practical for a midsized suv

306, 10 months ago,4,This car is great. I seriously considered buying this when I got my car but we got a better deal with Volkswagen.  I've heard great things about this car and the dependability. The parts aren't super expensive which is a different plus for a family with a lot of expenses.
307, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota car is very modern, it has an accessible price for people, the technology is very good, it is also comfortable and spacious in the trunk. I like the matter of the trunk so wide if you have children."
308, 10 months ago,5,"My son‘s first vehicle! We drove it till 212,000 miles and we still see it going around town!￼"
309, 10 months ago,5,"super utility vehicle! Drives like a dream- truck like ride, feels good on the highway but has the capability to drive virtually anywhere off road! can fit the family, but doesn't feel too big as an everyday driver either! the absolute coolest feature of this truck is the rear window! the window in the truck rolls down like every other window in the car, with just the push of a button! great to transport things like longer pieces of wood, or the family pooch!"
310, 10 months ago,5,"Not a fan of small cars but this one I loved. And it didn’t have all the bells and whistles, I loved it for the safety. We got hit by a big dually on the side of the back bumper where my son was and he was perfectly fine just startled. Toyota’s safety is why I love the company."

315, 10 months ago,5,"One of my first cars and I love it. It was durable, parts easy to replace and lasted me so long."
316, 10 months ago,5,It was a nice car. It belonged to my mom. Not my choice of cars to drive but it was a good car
317,10 months ago,3,"Even though this car is similar to a CR-V, the RAV4 feels much more cheaply made.  The roof of the RAV 4 is noticeably lower than my CR-V had and it has less cargo space."
318, 10 months ago,5,"El mejor carro que he tenido hasta el momento, es mi segundo Toyota y amo la marca, tienen mucho espacio, los asientos son cómodos y no hemos batallado en nada con el"

331, 10 months ago,5,"This minivan was the ultimate ride that all my friends begged to ride in. The high quality leather seats with adjustable armrests, DVD player with great sound quality speakers in the van and Bluetooth headphones, and outlets for charging devices in the back row made long trips a breeze! It was ahead of its time and the best family van of the 2000s no doubt."
332, 10 months ago,5,"I have a 2017 RAV4 and I love it. It snows here about 6 months out of the year, so this vehicle is definitely helpful. I love all the safety features as well. The only thing I wish is that it had colorful LED lights inside the car."
333, 10 months ago,5,"It isn’t bad. Maybe because I’ve been in an older model. It does drive good, and it can be comfortable depending on which model you get."
334, 10 months ago,4,"It’s an old model so I have to be gentle with it lol,  it is a 2002 Toyota Prius hybrid. Toyota. It runs good from time to time but there are some complications with it by it being so old. It has electricity issues."

343, 10 months ago,5,This car has served my family well. Parts are inexpensive and easy to find. No need for expensive visits to the mechanic if you take good care of this vehicle. All in all we are very happy with our purchase.
344, 10 months ago,5,"I LOVE my rav4. I specifically wanted a car that was big enough for pets, kids, groceries, errands.... but not so big that it felt like driving a boat down the street. I have a toddler and a dog and this car is perfect for me! I love all the features and technology."
345, 10 months ago,3,They are comfortable nice and safe. Sometimes it takes time to speed up but for the most part spacious  and comfy. Also cool push start button.
346, 10 months ago,4,"I love my car, Usually i only put Gas 1 time every two weeks, The leather seats make it really easy to keep my car clean with my son."
347, 10 months ago,5,I have a 2003 manual transmission toyota matrix and it is a cute little fun car. It has a sun roof/moon roof and great on gas (takes $20 to fill up).
348, 10 months ago,5,"I owned a 1999 rav 4 and drove it until 2010. Then i got a 2018 rav 4 xle and it doesn’t disappoint. It’s a great vehicle, it’s safe and it’s fun! And you can’t beat the price. If you’re looking for a safe affordable suv this is the way to go! And Toyota’s never loose their value"
349, 10 months ago,5,"This was my mom’s car, I loved driving it as well as riding in it. No real cons to it, maybe just that it’s not made for winter driving lol"
350, 10 months ago,5,my family has had our toyota sequoia since 2004 and it is still running. it was my first car and now my younger sisters first car. crazy reliable
351, 10 months ago,3,The dream car of mine! I have wanted these ever since I first saw one. Too bad I will never afford it lol
352, 10 months ago,5,I currently have a white 2015 and I am in love with it! It drives so smooth and is super fast
353, 10 months ago,5,I’ve never been so obsessed with my car. I’m finding reasons to leave the house just so I can drive it!!
354,10 months ago,4,"I love my car, but I hate the wide turning radius. I have to swing wide to turn so I have to be over to be able to park in spots etc and can be hard to parallel park, however the backup camera is very helpful with this issue. I also don't like how my other car you could stop at a moments notice, but this car you have to be a ways back to be ableto stop in time. If you brake suddenly you skid out of control and it's very scary. I would still recommend because this is a great car if you are careful."
355, 10 months ago,5,This car fit perfect to my family. Is easy to drive and have many things that help to keep you safe at the road.
356,10 months ago,4,I have had no problems with my Camry.  It has been very reliable.  I previously drove weekly 500 miles and back for class. No major work just regular maintenance
357, 10 months ago,3,It is a good everyday car. Nothing too special or spectacular about it. It has good gas mileage and nice room inside. The seats are a little uncomfortable.
358, 10 months ago,4,I really liked the design and interior space of the Toyota4Runner. Setting up the third row was easy and there was lots of leg room in the front and second row seats.
359, 10 months ago,2,A decent ride for an Uber but definitely doesn’t have the steak or the sizzle I look for in a sedan.
360,10 months ago,5,"I am absolutely smitten with this car. Reliable is an understatement to be honest. Pros, so many. The safety features are on point in this vehicle. I love all the cool and also safety features. And for the price, and the quality I think I really got the best deal!!!"
361, 10 months ago,5,Best car I’ve ever owned. I plan to keep this car till it can’t possibly drive any farther. It’s super easy to get my kids In and out.
362, 10 months ago,4,Honestly love it. Unfortunately I’m getting rid of it because it really doesn’t do well in the snow.
363,10 months ago,5,This was the most fuel efficient car I’ve owned!! I loved the smooth handling and the sporty look!
364, 10 months ago,4,Camry's are classic long lasting cars. They rarely have major problems and they handle pretty well. The newer ones have improved in style.
365, 10 months ago,5,"I love it so much. It has so much room, I can even move a full sized bed in the back! Comfy seats, good gas mileage. Perfect car"
366,10 months ago,5,"I loved my Toyota Corolla. It was such a reliable car and got great gas mileage. Let's be honest, Toyota's are some of the most reliable cars and my corolla was great for my 45-minute drive to work every morning. It's my favorite car that I've had so far. "
367,10 months ago,5,I love my 4 runner limited. There is 2 downfalls to This vehicle.  For the amount of money your paying for this vehicle the back hatch should automatically lift and close. An the car should have an auto remote crank.
368, 10 months ago,5,I have had my Camry for almost 5 years besides the average oil change and replacing my brakes every now and then I love it! Super reliable and good on gas.Toyota Camry
369, 10 months ago,5,"Great smaller SUV, great for a former car owner. Excellent in all weather conditions."
370, 10 months ago,5,"Spacious, great vehicle for a family with multiple children. Also great for adventures in all weather conditions."
371, 10 months ago,5,I have owned several Toyota Camrys. I currently drive a 2006 Toyota Camry LE and I love it! Camry is a comfortable and fuel efficient vehicle. Toyota’s vehicles are all extremely reliable.
372,10 months ago,5,"Yo pienso que Toyota es una de las mejores
 marcas del mercado. Tanto por su calidad sino como por su durabilidad. Y las reparaciones y piezas son más económicas que otras marcas."
373, 10 months ago,4,"Not the biggest fan of Toyota in general but my best friend has a 2018 Corolla. It has a couple cool or intriguing features but nothing to brag about. The Ruby Red Shimmering color is immediately noticeable and absolutely vibrant in color. It allso has headlights that automatically brighten and dim while you just drive. Pretty Cool to me butttt nothing else stands out more than the ridiculous price she paid for it.  Just not my thing, I guess. #snaps #contest"
374,10 months ago,5,Great family car. Spacious and it is so easy to use. The best thing about Toyota is that you will not have many problems with the car like german cars do.
375, 10 months ago,4,"Loved this car when my husband had it. Super stylish, with great features and drove great. Gas mileage was okay. Fit our teens in the back with leg room. Seats were not overall comfortable, as they seemed cheap compared to the rest of the car’s features."
376, 10 months ago,5,The camry is a great reliable car to have in your household. My mom has never had another car model other than a Camry. She loves it and always upgrades every 5 years.
377, 10 months ago,5,Car is super comfortable with many features of a higher end car. Easy to drive and awesome gas mileage. Just right for our family who commutes long distances for work. I’d recommend for commuters everywhere.
378,10 months ago,5,"I'm still driving the 2010 Toyota rav4 that my older sister and I both learned to drive in. it has over 130k miles on it and (knock on wood) everything necessary is still running smoothly. the radio doesn't work very well anymore, but the aux cord and CD player work fine, so I'm not without music. it's a smooth ride and still feels safe in all weather."
379,10 months ago,5,This car is a beast. I have minimal problems with it. Will survive the apocalypse. Would recommend to anyone wanting minimal maintenance.
380, 10 months ago,5,Beautiful car.  Great family car.  Drives nicely in the snow.  My daughters car is black with gold.  Just all around good car. Great gas mileage.
381, 10 months ago,5,I absolutely adore my Corolla . Until this day it has never failed me . I love their safety it warns you about not having your seatbelt on or if you’re too close to a car ... etc !! I’m currently looking out to get a chr it caught my eye . I highly recommend it !!
382, 10 months ago,5,"My 2nd or 3rd car was a 2001 Camrey. My grandparents always drive Toyotas my grandmother gave my mom an old '85 Camry that she used to haul us around in when I was a kid. Back then she could fill the tank for five bucks and drive all week. Those days are gone, but, my '01 Camry ran forever. At roughly 250k miles it dies on me less than a mile from USF Tampa on finals day! My dad and brother rebuilt it and my brother drove it for another 50k miles."
383, 10 months ago,5,"This is my THIRD Toyota, SECOND Corolla! Lol. My second car was a 2001 Camry. It died on my on the way to class ON FINAL DAY! I thought it was done for at roughly 250k miles, but my dad and brother rebuilt it and he drove it for ANOTHER 50K MILES! When it came time for me to buy a new car off the lot in 2006, my def first choice was a Corolla. It was on the road until 2015 when I totaled it unfortunately.  Then in 2017 my cousin got a new car and graciously gave me his old 2001 Corolla. It's still going strong at 270k miles."
384, 10 months ago,5,"Descent gas milage, very nice smooth ride, powerful motor.  Only problem is battery terminals corrode very quickly abd need to be cleaned often. Also interior door handles plastic and 2 have had to be replaced.  But I would buy again"
385,10 months ago,4,Rav4 used to be my fav Toyota cars. Unfortunately they have changed the style and size and its most in mini van territory. If not for the change I'd get it a 3rd time
386, 10 months ago,5,"Der Toyota Sienna ist ein Van, der seit Ende 1997 vom japanischen Automobilhersteller Toyota in den USA ausschließlich für den amerikanischen Markt gefertigt wird."
387,10 months ago,5,"La quiero, estoy enamorada de esta camioneta y espero tenerla pronto. Trabajare duro para lograrlo.Ya compre el llavero, por algo debo comenzar jajaja"
388,10 months ago,5,"I know this is not the most sexy car, but I love it so much.  I have the Prius V, and it fits our family so well.   So much space and such good gas mileage.  The gas savings from switching from an SUV was mind boggling. saving the environment and my pocketbook.  Win-win."
389, 10 months ago,3,Horrible acceleration to a point where my foot is to the floor and the car is screaming but still not speeding up. It's also ugly and overpopulated but it only has 3 stars for the reliability
390, 10 months ago,3,"Think this car is slower than I was hoping it would be. Basic maintenance and repairs are pretty inexpensive though. The gauges have shiny rings around them which blind you on sunny days so think that was poorly designed but all in all, it isn’t bad."
391,10 months ago,5,"Hubby drives it and loves it! SUV's are very comfortable.  Nice ride. Not the greatest on gas mileage,  but not terrible either. Good family vehicle."
392,10 months ago,5,"Good car. Economical and practical.  No frills, but dependable.  Bought new in 2005, then traded for Rav 4 in 2016."
393,10 months ago,5,"Toyota makes great cars. Never have had any issues. Good mileage,  comfortable family car.. We have had this one since 2017. My husband drives a 2016 Rav 4, which he loves!

We have also had a Corolla (2005)-economical and trouble free."
394, 10 months ago,4,"It is a good solid everyday car. I think other similar models have more interior room, but very reliable car!"
395, 10 months ago,5,I used to drive a 4 runner and loved it so much!  Barely ever had any problems and love the spaciousness and it was really nice
396, 10 months ago,5,Toyota la mejor me encanta esta marca muy buena y muy confiable no se rompe muy buena estabilidad en la carretera bien amplio
397, 10 months ago,5,Recently purchased and love it so far! I love the sporty look and feel of this car! Here’s to hoping it lasts and takes good care of my family for years to come!
398, 10 months ago,5,I like my car. Mostly I like the reliability of the car and the warranty provided. This is my first Toyota and I don’t suspect it will be he last.
399, 10 months ago,4,Love this car and the amazing gas mileage. I do wish it were a little shorter and more narrow. It also doesn’t take bumps well.
400, 10 months ago,5,I Love my Sienna. It accommodates 6+ passengers. The t.v. comes in handy for our long trips and keep the children entertained. I have not had any issues with my vehicle.
401, 10 months ago,3,Over priced as an SUV when I purchased mine new quite a few years ago. It held up well for a while then it fell apart all at once and was almost impossible to repair for a reasonable price.
402, 10 months ago,3,This car was fine. Pretty standard and fair quality. I think they are a little over priced and breakdown a little sooner than some other in their class.
403,10 months ago,4,My yaris is older. It's great for me to take the kids to school and get to work. I use mine to get from point a to b its an 07 but it runs like a dream not many issues at all. It was affordable and an all around great car.
404,10 months ago,5,"I purchased this car prior to purchasing my second Toyota, I currently own both of them. 
My Prius is amazing for gas, that's if I run it using gas and not the electric part. I do plug it in every night although if it does run out of electric juice it does switch over to gas.
The features are great! I chose to upgrade the features as I find getting a new car and already paying so much why not pay a little more and have all the features that the car offers as a luxury. 
I do find myself driving it more often then I would BUT I own another Toyota SUV so I do switch between the two. I do feel safe in it BUT I drive my SUV with my 5yr old and my Prius when I am alone, although it does have all the safety features as well."
405, 10 months ago,4,"Comfortable, easy to drive car. My one complaint is that I did get the hybrid version and I don’t have to put the key in the ignition - something that still feels very unnatural to me. I think I would prefer turning my car on with a key rather than a button."
406,10 months ago,5,"I absolutely love my RAV4! 
I feel very safe in it because it is a larger suv. It has all the built in features as I chose to upgrade everything. The car has cameras on all 4 sizes, it has sensors that alert me and it has a lot of space. Can't go wrong with this car."
407, 10 months ago,5,"Now I would never own one of these  cuz its low to the ground but having rides on I can say that the 2020 model is very stylish on the inside game me a futuristic vibe. It looks small on the outside but plenty of space on the inside, also comfortable, and very quiet. A must have for the eco friendly collection."
408, 10 months ago,5,I think its a great car for a great price. Its very resilient and lasts for a very long time. In terms of features its a little behind unless you want to pay extra just to have navigation. The milage will definitly take you far if you drive alot or have many destinations.
409,10 months ago,5,My first and all time favorite vehicle.  I love how affordable and dependable Toyota Celica's are. They have a lot of room inside the car and have excellent gas mileage.  These cars are so dependable and drive so nicely too. I will always recommend Toyota.  It's a brand that you can count on.
410,10 months ago,5,Toyota vehicles are in a class of their own.  They will run forever as long as you keep the oil changed and service your vehicle regularly. They get great gas mileage and are so comfortable and extremely affordable. I will always recommend Toyota!
411, 10 months ago,5,I love this car. It is spacious. It is smooth and you do not feel the road. It is a very comfortable car.
412, 10 months ago,5,I love this car. I leased a Camry for 3 years and now I lease a Corolla. I love the size of it and how I can park anywhere without having to worry about not fitting into the parking space. I can connect my phone to the screen and see my gps. I think this car is great in the snow. I recommend it.
413,10 months ago,5,"When I had a camry, it was my pride and joy. That car was loyal and easy to maintain. The gas mileage was amazing. The trunk space was great. It was a very good car to me"
414,10 months ago,5,"Amazing car, reliable, really really comfortable. It has a good mpg rate. I think it could be higher for snow places, but it is a sedan so it’s just ok. The media part is really good. I think I would probably buy one."
415, 10 months ago,3,It's a reliable car but when it is really cold you have to scrape off frost from the windshield in the INSIDE!!!
416, 10 months ago,4,"I’ve driven this model (and the other in Yaris line) in Portugal and Sicily while travelling. It’s a good compromise between FIAT 500 and Alfa Romeo. It’s really fast, low consume, high performance either on highway and around city. Plenty solid and technology-advance, easy to park and not so expensive to buy or rent. You have to like japanese car and mind, for liking this. As a rented car it’s plenty satisfy, but for a long term use not in my chord."
417, 10 months ago,5,"I LOVE my Camry!!!!! Automatic with all kinds of goodies. It’s about mid way + from being top of the line! I got it Mother’s Day last year, I live in Louisville KY and it’s been to Florida, Cincinnati (twice) and Gatlingburg. And the oil has been changed once, (it’s going tomorrow for one). The type of oil they use will allow you to go up to 10,000 miles before your next change. I love everything about it, it’s an 2018 and looks brand new. I bought it from one of the major rental dealerships and have not been disappointed at all. Car fax checked and we even have a little of the warranty left on it. I love the style, sporty but not flashy and it’s only a 4 cylinder but she’s got some get up and go power!! Toyota Camry"
418, 10 months ago,3,"I bought a Scion TC when I had to get rid of my Mustang, however it wasn't my first car choice. This car is comfortable and has space but also has a lot of blind spots. I made a deal when purchasing it I had to have a back up camera installed and this made mine unique! I did love my TC but didn't have it very long before buying my BMW."
419, 10 months ago,5,Enjoy Great Deals & Service Today. Don't Miss Our Current Offers ...nice car  my is lease  i like and I love this car...
420, 10 months ago,3,"Debated between this and Honda Pilot. Ultimately ended with the pilot because the third row offered more leg room. The third row of the Highlander was truly only meant for children, so small and uncomfortable."
421, 10 months ago,3,"Was looking for a larger SUV and although it was a comfortable ride, it didn’t seem like the best fit for an expanding family. Didn’t like that it didn’t have third row seating"
422, 10 months ago,4,"We drove a 4 runner on a cross country road trip. 7k Plus miles in 22 days. Car was comfortable, spacious but horrible on gas for that long of a trip. Overall a nice SUV, but as we don’t purchase non American made cars - and weren’t offered one for rental - we would not purchase this vehicle."
423,10 months ago,5,It's lasted us a good amount of time. I even drive everyday. So its a really good car as long as you keep up with maintnense and do regular check up than your good. We bought it used but it was worth the price. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice reliable car.
424, 10 months ago,4,If you take care of your Toyota it will run forever. I’ve had a great experience with my Camry!! I’m a proud owner of Toyota!
425, 10 months ago,3,This was the first expensive purchase my husband and I made a few years after we got married. We had to change coil packs often and both of the engine mounts.
426, 10 months ago,5,I like how much room I have and all the features that I have. I just wish I had remote start on it. I have the limited platinum so you would think you would have every option out there on it but it don’t.
427, 10 months ago,5,"Recomendado , el manejo es muy cómodo y seguro , sus asientos son suaves sus protecciones son muy buenas por algún tipo de accidente , la seguridad es de una excelente calidad y sus colores son un complemento seguro y perfecto ✨"
428, 10 months ago,5,"La mia macchina Toyota yaris 2008 lo adoro e la mia bella macchina.. e molto comfortable, e facile da guidare,"
429, 10 months ago,5,Hands down the best car I’ve ever owned. Perfect amount of space for kids and hauling bulky stuff. Smooth ride and very comfortable.
430, 10 months ago,3,This car is great for a small family. Two car seats with the cup holder in between makes for a much more enjoyable driving experience. The MPG is impeccable and definitely makes me feel like I don’t have to fill the tank as often. My only critique would be the outside noise that is audible from inside the cabin while driving. It’s sometimes hard to hear my kids in the backseat even with the radio and air off.
431, 10 months ago,5,"I love this suv. It is a great ride ,quiet,comfortable and reliable. Would recommend this vehicle to everyone. I live in the northeast great in the snow."
432, 10 months ago,5,"Es  economico ,no gasta mucha Gasolina encuentras parking donde sea confortable cuatro puertas es Toyota y me gusta"
433,10 months ago,5,Toyota is the only brand I will buy. It's the only vehicle (that I know of) that has reached the million mile mark. These vehicles seem to last forever. Unfortunately that's why they are sometimes very pricey.
434,10 months ago,4,"Love that it's small and compact, but still roomy and spacious inside. The only thing I don't like are some of the blind spots. I do love its gas efficiency."
435, 10 months ago,5,This is my first car and I absolutely love it. It’s great for people who have a small family or barely drive anywhere and the gas mileage is the best. I probably get gas about every 3 weeks and I drive around everywhere. I highly recommend this car in the color silver SE model.
436, 10 months ago,4,I HAD THIS WHEN i was younger. It was a sporty little car Alot of features like panoramic views.. the pedals are small so it compliments small feetl. This car is not good for the winter. Price 22k I ugh used. The only reason I sold is because my kids didn't fit in the back. I would recommend it to a family of too.
437, 10 months ago,5,"I love the scion I owned the sport edition. The car is fast. It's roomy for smaller shorter people. LOU WHO WAS 275 HAD A HARD TIME GETTING AND OUT THE CAR. ITS GREAT ON GAS.  IT WAS AVERAGE ABOUT 22K SPORT. I WOUKDVRECOOMEND FOR A TEENAGER OR SOME1 WITH NO KIDS, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LEG-ROON IN THE BACK AT ALL."
438, 10 months ago,4,I love my 4 runner so much I bought 2 different times. It's roomy it's great in the snow. Great gas mlage you can get it a 4 or 6 cylinder so you save on gas. You will love the room and has a optional third row. The price is about 30k and up. But Toyota hold great book value. So when your ready to trade it in.
439, 10 months ago,5,I love my Tundra I own the 1792 edition which gives me customize seat. It rides smoothe plenty of room. The only draw back is the miles per gallon and how much it takes to fill. The tundra with all the bells and whistle is costly but so worth it. It has backup camera in dash navigation. Moonroof. Automatic brakes and switch to 4×4 is easy.
440, 10 months ago,5,"Segurança e confortável, gosto da durabilidade do carro, confio muito nos carros da Toyota"
441, 10 months ago,5,"Economia e durabilidade, custo benefício espetaculares, ótimo para trabalhar com entregas"

443, 10 months ago,5,I absolutely love Toyota’s ...I believe this is the go-to starter car for teens. They last for a very long time and great on gas too.
444,10 months ago,4,"mi carro es pequeño, me encanta porque es comodo y con el eh rodado para la playa, es muy ligero y de facil acceso para cualquier estacionamiento, es mi marca favorita de carro! "
445,10 months ago,3,I bought a brand new Corolla years bk it had issues and a lot of road noise. I traded it a few years later.
446,10 months ago,4,I love my new car.. its very comfy and the drive is so smooth.. i wish it could have some more features but i love to drive it
447, 10 months ago,3,Nice care not a big fan. Has lots of room if you need the space. It’s been many years since I have been in one so I’m guessing they have gotten better.
448, 10 months ago,5,I LOVE my Highlander. I bought her used from my neighbor and she had pretty high mileage but runs like a top!Toyota Highlander
449, 10 months ago,5,We have been married 15 years and purchased two Camrys that have been in our family. Loyal to Toyota for reliability and safety. Have had other makes that did not last as long. We keep our vehicles until they have 150K or more miles. Toyota is the only make that lasts without many repair issues as long as we have proper maintenance.
450, 10 months ago,5,Love my Rav4. Loyal to Toyota for reliability and safety. Have had other makes that did not last as long. We keep our vehicles until they have 150K or more miles. Toyota is the only make that lasts without many repair issues as long as we have proper maintenance.

452, 10 months ago,5,The gas you get for low price is great. They last a long time and in my opinion they’re worth the $$
453, 10 months ago,5,I just bought a 2020 Camry SEnand I’m in love. I’ve had her for six months now and it’s such an upgrade from my old car. Gas mileage is great. Love the radio and Apple connectivity. Even got my hands on one with a sunroof.IN LOVE WITH MY CAR
454, 10 months ago,5,"I love my car! It is a safe and reliable car and was my first car purchase ever. It drives great and was just enough for me and the great price helped as well. It is a pretty basic car, but still really nice and affordable!"
455, 10 months ago,5,Toyota is one of the best car brands out there and their cars last for so long as long as you take care of them! I cannot tell you what my car has been through and it is still standing and works perfectly and nothing is wrong with it even after years of usage.￼
456, 10 months ago,5,THE BEST CAR!!!!! I love my 4-runner! It is a little cramped with 2 car seats but I love it so much that I don’t mind!
457, 10 months ago,5,"Purchased my 2005 Corolla in 2006. Only thing I ever had to do was change the oil. It’s had 275,000 miles and ran perfect.

461, 10 months ago,5,Also safe I love the Toyota brand as my family almost everyone owns a Toyota. Parents owned this one in a hybrid.
462, 10 months ago,5,Safe and reliable dad bought my sister this car when she got her license. She still has it today
463, 10 months ago,5,"I love it. It’s comfortable, is huge you can put whatever you want and you will have room. You don't feel anything while you are driving, it feels like the car is off but no. The car is amazing. It has 7 seats."
464, 10 months ago,5,"I love the Rav 4. My only complaint is that it is too small for me. It has the same room as a car. But, if space isn't an issue for you and you want something a little higher up than a car, the Rav4 is a great choice."
465, 10 months ago,5,"I have had 4 Camrys total which I LOVED. However, I wanted something higher up with more room. I decided to get a Highlander. I absolutely love my highlander. Not only is it gorgeous but it has so much room!"

467, 10 months ago,5,"Para mi es uno de los mejores autos , con ello puedo llevar a toda mi familia es grande espasioso  comodos y muy rapidos ,,cada dia mejoran sus autos me quedo con ellos"
468, 10 months ago,5,"Like kanye says what ""What you think I rap for, to push a #### Rav 4?"" Well kanye that's what I'm pushing. And that's what imma keep on pushing. Because it's a very nice and reliable car. Save me tons of gas. Absolutely love it."
469, 10 months ago,5,"I drove a Toyota for a few years and the car had over 200,000 miles on it. It was still so reliable and I never had issues with it. I would definitely recommend this car!"
470, 10 months ago,5,"Love the 4-runner and tundra’s that Toyota offers. They both have lots of room, only went with Honda choice because better gas mileage."
471, 10 months ago,2,"This is my second Camry i have purchased and compared to my 2008 Camry XLE my  2028 Camry XSE is a downgrade. Everything was better in my 2008, it was faster and I got better gas mileage. Also the plastic parts are flimsier and break off."
472, 10 months ago,5,Great car very reliable I will never own another brand. They are great cars. They are good on gas.
473, 10 months ago,4,"Great in gas , defiantly recommend. This is a great economic car but not very fancy at all. So if your into luxury it’s not the best choice."
474, 10 months ago,5,"Cómodo, espacioso para ser pequeño, asientos cómodos, diseño interno bonito a la vista, en el exterior es pequeño pero adorable, cabe en cualquier estacionamiento, lo tengo desde el 007 y hasta el sol de hoy no he tenido problemas."
475, 10 months ago,4,Great car for beginner drivers. I have the RAV4 2019 XLE. The gas pedal is a little bit sensitive but makes it easier for new drivers to get used to pressing on the gas and not pressing too hard. The car is compatible to CarPlay on your iPhone. You can also see your speed in digital form not just a meter. ￼￼￼
476,10 months ago,5,I loved riding in my friends 4Runner. It was fairly smooth and was large enough to pack things up but not crazy large to make parking difficult.
477, 10 months ago,5,"Such a great small SUV.  Ours has over 100,000 miles and it’s still running great!  12 years old.  Toyota’s last forever!!  It has 4wd which is great for where we live.  It’s small but powerful enough to do whatever we need."
478,10 months ago,4,"i drove a 2012 prius until 2020. i used to commute 210 miles a day for work and more recently 50 miles a day. it saved me so much in gas. my only complaint is if i sit in the back seat, i get kinda car sick because it’s too smooth. it drives like a space ship"
479, 10 months ago,5,"For whatever reason, I avoided Toyota cars for a long time. But recently, my fiancé and I purchased a 2019 Camry and this is probably the best car I’ve ever had. It gets great gas mileage, it runs so smooth, and I just love driving it!"
480, 10 months ago,5,Toyota RAV4 are nice vehicles. They are easy to drive and maneuver. Toyotas are good dependable vehicles. They are a little pricey but are worth the price you pay because they will last a very long time. You can drive these vehicles for many years as long as you take care of them. 
481, 10 months ago,5,"I love this car so much. I wanted a car like this and my 2020 model has amazing bells and whistles. Wish I'd sprung for Leather, but oh well. "
482, 10 months ago,4,Como para una chica y mas si es su primer automóvil. Ya que tiene todas las comodidades por dentro. Así que es fantastic. Ya tengo 4 años con el.
483, 10 months ago,5,I freakin love my Prius Limited 2020.    I have all the bells and whistles on it and it’s super roomy!   I went from a 2011 Toyota Sienna to this and im never feeling too smushed in it.   The backseat is roomy for 2 grown men!!!  and i get around 53 MPG!   IN THE CITY!     I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
484,10 months ago,5,Love our Sequoia! We’ve had it for over 18 years! Yeah there’s some where in tear on it but it sure is a nice car it’s almost as though we have a truck we can carry everything in! Seats eight people so we had wonderful road trips full of family and friends! It’s a very comfortable ride!￼
485, 10 months ago,5,My Toyota Camry is a great car! It gets great gas mileage and drives like a dream! It is very spacious and comfortable for long driving trips! I love the sound system it has also! I would definitely buy another Toyota!
486, 10 months ago,4,Is a good car looks pretty and is spacious and confortable I never drive it just like passenger but was a good experience
487, 10 months ago,5,My Rav4 is getting a little long in the tooth but I still love it. It's been very reliable for 10 years so far and I hope to keep it around for as long as possible.
488, 10 months ago,5,This is a nice riding car with good gas mileage. I have had this car for a few years with no problems at all. I love the car
489, 10 months ago,5,"Very smooth driving and very comfortable car, it gets great gas mileage on the road or highway. Looks like a very high end vehicle."
490, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota did something right with the Camry. It’s a great sedan, great size and absolutely beautiful. The drive is nice. The features are up to date. The gas mileage is good. I would recommend a Camry."
491, 10 months ago,4,Cute crossover that offers space without compromising gas mileage. It’s a reliable vehicle and good for long trips. Plenty of space in the back to move around a lot of things and those large shopping trips to IKEA.
492, 10 months ago,2,A little to small for a sedan. I would prefer something roomier and higher off the ground. This is a good commuter and probably something easier to drive and recommend if you’re looking for a rental vehicle and driving around in a new city.
493,10 months ago,5,"Rented a Prius to drive to vacation. Great gas economy, very quiet cabin and it handled the road beautifully. It's a sensible car to own if you're driving to work more than a couple of miles."
494, 10 months ago,5,"Reliable, good on gas. Roomy... everything you could ask for in a commuter car. Lasted a long time"
495, 10 months ago,5,"this was my first car and i miss it so much! drives great, great mileage and great pice. recommend for any first time buyer"
496, 10 months ago,5,I bough this car 8 years ago and it still runs like new. I will never buy anything other than a Toyota from now on.
497, 10 months ago,5,"2009. Car has 315000kms and never had an issue, even during Canadian winters! This car is bulletproof!"
498, 10 months ago,3,"The truth is, this car feels very unstable, but it has good technology and the trunk is super wide and comfortable for my baby's stroller and the market"
499, 10 months ago,5,My sister in law drives this car. It handles extremely well. The gas mileage on the 2000s Toyota is great! A tank will get you easily three hours out. About 300 miles a tank.
500,10 months ago,5,I love Toyota cars because I feel like they last forever. Great on gas and really durable. very affordable 
501, 10 months ago,3,The bumpers definitely need to be made with something stronger. When I got my car I bumped into someone’s car and my front bumper has been loose since. I’ve seen a lot of other Toyota corollas with a loose front bumper as well.
502, 10 months ago,5,"This was the first brand new car purchase and I have been obsessed with my black Toyota Rav 4 sports mode since the day I purchased it. I would never trade it in,  this car has never let me down. I feel safe and pleasantly pleased with this purchase.  Toyota RAV4"
503, 10 months ago,5,My husband has the sporty little Toyota Corolla and we absolutely love it. It's a good reliable car with good safety features like warning you when something is wrong or slowing you down if the car in front of you abruptly stops. We love the eco feature and the sport feature as well. Very sturdy car and will keep you safe in rigid weather conditions.
504, 10 months ago,5,"Let's get this straight.... Toyota's are one of the best Car Brands out there and my Rav4 is such a good durable reliable car. I love how my car starts to slow down if the car in front of me abruptly stops and it warns me if there are any issues that are wrong with the SUV. The back up cam one of my favorite features... With a big car, it is so handy to be able to see directly behind you when you are backing up. If you love a good reliable vehicle that is spacious and keeps you safe, then Toyota RAV4 is just for you!"
505, 10 months ago,5,I bought the 4 Runner used. It belonged to my good friend who passed away so I knew it had been well taken care of. I bought it for my Son’s first vehicle. It’s a little small for me. I’m used to driving a Tahoe. I don’t feel like I have enough room in the 4 runner when I want to haul something.
506, 10 months ago,4,"This car is absolutely so fun to drive! There’s plenty of room, and love that the back window rolls down! The only down side is if you have kids ride in the back it can be a little cramped."
507, 10 months ago,4,Great gas mileage around 35 miles to gallon...not 42 like window stick says.  Smooth drive.  Air conditioning makes a gurgling sound.
508,10 months ago,5,"I have a Yaris 2008 first is super economic, the quality is great, cheap parts, comfortable, I can drive long distance and it doesn’t spend a lot of gas. Very fast 💨 I definitely recommend this car!!!"
509, 10 months ago,5,"I drove a 2020 Toyota Camry for a week. That car is amazing!!! It's fast also, you have to make sure you watch the speed or you might get in trouble. I'm sure there are some improvements to be made, but I can't see any changes I would make. I would recommend the Toyota Camry."
510, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota Highlanders are great vehicles. I'm driving an older model Hilander, it has over a 100,000 miles on it and it still drives like it's a new vehicle. They are very sturdy and lasts a very long time. I would recommend the Toyota Highlander."
511, 10 months ago,5,"I've had this car since I was in college. It has been so reliable and has gotten me through my college commute, my first job commute, and many trips in between! I've driven this car from Southern to Northern California several times and I haven't had to have very many repairs on it. I haven't had to have anything major done on the car (just minor repairs every now and then). I would highly recommend this car to anyone, particularly high school or college students in need of a reliable vehicle!"
512, 10 months ago,5,I love my car i have a 2009 toyota rav4 and it is my 1st car and im absolutely in love with my car maintenance is affordable and car never has any issues if your thinking about a rav4 dont think anymore just do it really great cars
513, 10 months ago,5,"Uno de los mejores carros del mercado, confortable, económico, seguro y de marca reconocida y segura."
514, 10 months ago,5,IN LOVE is the only way to describe my thoughts on the 4Runner. A good friend of mine just purchased one with all the bells and whistles. Easy to drive and handles snowy conditions better than any vehicle I’ve seen. It’s incredibly spacious and cozy - it feels like you’re driving on a sofa.
515, 10 months ago,3,"I've been a passenger in a Toyota Prius.  They are very small and  low to get into.  I hit me head getting in.  And I felt like I was riding on the ground.  At 62 yrs., it is just not the car for me.  I need and want comfort when I travel.  It also scares me on the expressway when a large truck is following it.  It just doesn't feel safe enough for me."
516, 10 months ago,5,I love my Toyota Highlander this is my second one. I love that I have the space just with three children without having to buy a minivan. I have the XLE and prior to this one I had the LE plus￼. I love everything about my car except I do find that the front seats could be a little more comfortable.
517, 10 months ago,5,"My family and I been loyal Toyota customers for years now. We only buy from Toyota and truly love the brand. We also only get our cars served by Toyota dealerships. We swear by the brand. Toyota is known for their reliability and sustainability. If you're looking for a great car that will last you ages, Toyota is the way to go. My mom owns a 2008 Toyota 4Runner that she has absolutely loved and is now looking to replace it with another Toyota. I currently drive a Toyota Corolla and am in the market for a new car as well. I'm hoping to be able to afford a size up to a Toyota Camry. Corollas are great starter cars, I would definitely recommend this car for new drivers. Toyota offers everything from rugged to luxury. You can't go wrong buying with Toyota. "
518,10 months ago,4,Get car later 15 years and probably only got it fixed 5 or 6 times it was worth it and very spacious in it too.
519, 10 months ago,4,"The Camry drives just as well as the Lexus (sorry if you overpaid for your ES) and if you have all the bells and whistles, the quality will feel the same as well. If I was buying a car that wasn’t luxury but wanted the closest thing, I would let it be the Camry."
520, 10 months ago,5,Por dentro es bastante espacioso. Los asientos delanteros no se suben pero tienen una buena posición . Asientos de cuero para una fácil limpieza y un reproductor de sonido digital
521,10 months ago,5,Toyota’s are great cars. I have owned the Corolla and 2 camrys. My current one is a 2008 and I have had it for 12 years. Take care of it and it will take care of you.
522, 10 months ago,5,"1990 Toyota carry after 31 years of use with only 160 kms it 8s still running like bran new. Drives great, has had no problems. As a passenger its a great ride. The sound on this modal could be better, but it is from 1990 so I couldn't be mad at it."
523, 10 months ago,4,"Dependable little vehicle - I've owned 3 in the past.  I did notice that in the winter, when driving at high speeds you can feel a draft around your legs."
524, 10 months ago,5,"I owned a 2013 Toyota Highlander for 8 years.  Other than basic maintenance (oil change, tire rotation etc....), it has NEVER been in the shop.  Not once.  This vehicle is so reliable it's insane."
525, 10 months ago,5,I have had two Prius and I love them!!! Low maintenance and perfect for commuting or taking for a drive. Super spacious as well
526,10 months ago,5,"As with my previous experience with another Toyota, the Corolla is amazing. Reliable and affordable car that requires low maintenance"
527,10 months ago,5,The longevity of Toyota is phenomenal. They are reliable cars. My experience with a Celica was great. The car lasted me many years with no issues and just kept maintenance on it.
528, 10 months ago,4,Good car but I prefer to drive the smaller Toyota version of the Yaris which I traded mine too.  I have driven my parents car but find it hard to see behind when reversing.
529, 10 months ago,5,Love my little Toyota Yaris ! The only problem was the faulty airbags which were replaced free of charge. Small and zippy and great on fuel
530, 10 months ago,4,This car is ok for driving in the city. It’s fairly comfortable but not so much when you go on a long road trip.
531, 10 months ago,5,This little car is so nice. I used to hate 4 cylinders but after owning this vehicle I will always own one and will most likely pass this vehicle to my daughters. The technology and safety give me so much peace of mind
532, 10 months ago,5,"Once again, Toyota is a great a promising brand. My mother drives a 4Runner that she’s had since I was a child. Our family swears by Toyotas and will only buy from this brand. We are both currently in the market for new Toyota’s. Would highly recommend purchasing a Toyota."
533, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota’s are one of the best car brands you can come by. They are known for their reliability and sustainability. My family only buys Toyota’s, we swear by them. I am currently in the market for a new car and hoping to afford to upgrade to a Camry. Love this car brand, would absolutely recommend whether you’re a new driver, or in the market for something a little more high fashion. Toyota makes rugged and fashionable, you can’t go wrong. Toyota Motor Company Toyota Corolla Toyota Camry"
534, 10 months ago,5,"My mother in law owns a Highlander! It rides smoothly, and it’s spacious on the inside! It’s a great car for long road trips!"
535, 10 months ago,5,Me encanta este carro cómodo muchos features es grandioso lo recomiendo para todo el mundo
536, 10 months ago,4,I bought a Camry after owning a Nissan there were two things that stuck out 1- the air conditioning didn’t get as cold as my Nissan BUT ....2- the get up and go was much better pick up than my Nissan. I love their initial service package and these cars will run til the wheels fall off. I’ve had my Camry 5 yrs and I’m satisfied but now I need sporty...
537, 10 months ago,5,Love 4 runner won’t go back to a sedan I just couldn’t see it . These are roomy and comfortable and can fit a lot in the trunk !!
538,10 months ago,5,"I owned a 2019 Toyota Highlander for about two years before trading it in for a Chevy Tahoe. I found the Highlander to have a smooth, steady ride and acceptable acceleration for my mostly highway commute. It felt safe and sturdy to drive. Plenty of legroom, storage space and seating. Third row is VERY tight for an average height adult and is more suited for kids.

If your looking for a very reliable, comfortable, well built crossover, the Highlander is a great option."
539, 10 months ago,5,Tengo 9 años con mi van y desde que la compre nunca he tenido ningún problema es comada para viajar con la familia.
540, 10 months ago,5,I love my van. Never thought I’d ever drive one but I’m so glad i tried one out. I recommend the sienna to anyone with kids!
541, 10 months ago,5,"Reliable and gas efficient! I've never known the blessings of seat warmers until I got this car! Nor did I ever use Bluetooth until I had a corolla. It'd a great value for a car, and I recommend it! It's my first car. "
542, 10 months ago,5,These cars are very comfortable and rode very smooth! Toyota is definitely a go to brand for me when it comes to cars!
543, 10 months ago,5,"I traveled in this car and it’s very smooth to drive and don’t consume that much gas, it’s amazing"
544, 10 months ago,3,This car was bought used and already had lots of miles on it.  It was not a smooth ride but did have room for three car seats.
545, 10 months ago,5,"I had the Highlander before this and I don’t miss not having a the extra room... This is surprisingly spacious for a little SUV! Very comfortable, was a great little car for our road trip to the Grand Canyon and gets great mileage around town."
546, 10 months ago,5,Very good car.  I have had it since 2000.  Very little car trouble.  I would throughly recommend it.
547, 10 months ago,5,"Mi esposo tiene el 2020 y de verdad que me encanta, es un carro super sencillo pero hermoso y cómodo. Corolla LE"
548, 10 months ago,5,"Love the Corolla, very smooth ride and super good quality for the reasonable price. Perfect size for a family of 1-3 and really nice for going almost anywhere, either the grocery store or a road trip to another state. I would recommend it as it is great quality for the price."
549, 10 months ago,4,"Really good car for the price and loved the interior, it felt very close to luxury. Smooth riding, and lasted a while but the engine did blow out creating a large fire. Other than that I think it was a good car and very affordable for the price. I would recommend."
550, 10 months ago,5,"This is a smoother version of the Corolla, built to last longer. It is also quite affordable to maintain and its parts are easily found in the market."
551, 10 months ago,5,It’s a basic car that is very affordable to maintain and is able to carry my son and I everywhere we need to go (we use the car for both long and short distant travel). It’s also well built and very durable.
552, 10 months ago,5,"We love our highlander! Every time a family member or friend drives our car they always mention how nice it rides. The safety features, especially the blind spot monitor makes me feel so much safer."
553, 10 months ago,5,"Want a car that can last forever?  Well gt yourself a toyota corolla.  This was bought in 2010 and has over 190,000 miles.  This thing has taken a beating and still remains strong.  No major issues.  Just take it for its scheduled maintance.  Hoping to reach 250,000!"
554,10 months ago,4,It’s a nice car. Larger than other normal 4 passenger seats cars. It’s a very good choice for big families 😌.
555,10 months ago,4,This very great car. I like how it saves gas and it doesn’t waste that much and very affordable and comfy.
556, 10 months ago,5,"This was my first ever vehicle I purchased on my own. I have a 2019 Toyota RAV4, great gas mileage. Toyota is a great company in general. There are several different styles of this vehicle. I chose the Adventure due to all the different settings."
557, 10 months ago,5,"❤🚘Yeeeesssssss! This is My second Toyota! And I love it! (2010) (Named Empress 2)😆The drive is sooo smooth and it has lots of room. Looks very compact but it isn't! The seats I can move in and out of the car and third row seats are wonderful for my big family. I love that I can use the back up camera because I love to back into my garage as well as parking spots a lot. 🤣 She is also Black with the manufacturer tint which was a big concern for me, but it's not so bad. Great on gas mileage for me. Runs smooth. Love the heated seats! The rain covers on the windows. Just Beautiful! Hopefully later on I will be able to upgrade to an newer model because I love the look of these Makes of cars."
558, 10 months ago,5,(1996)😍🚘This was the second car I ever owned. I bought it my second year in college all by myself.  When I saw it I was in love and the car lot knew it. I over paid for it but had it paid off within two years. This car ran sooo very smoothly  and it already had just the right amount of tint on it. The seats wear comfortable. Lots of space for me. It took great care of this car.(Named Empress) As well as she got me up and down the road and travels as a young single chic. I had no problems before or after oil changes. This is a great car to have for all walks of life.
559, 10 months ago,5,"Love my RAV4. Affordable and dependable. I’ve put 200,000 miles on it and it is still going strong"
560, 10 months ago,5,"My husband is always saying we are a Toyota family and how their cars are the best there is, I’m no car expert but my parents liked Toyota too and this is a nice looking car"
561, 10 months ago,5,"LOVE MY CAR!! I have a 2020 RAV4 Hybrid XSE. The gas mileage alone makes this car my family’s go to for long road trips. It’s a smooth ride, with enough space for my family of four. The all-wheel drive comes in handy when we venture off the path. Plus, I was able to score 0% interest with Toyota Financial!"
562,10 months ago,5,I’m on my second one. I never thought I would love a minivan until I got one. Now I couldn’t imagine having any other primary vehicle. The sliding doors save my life. I love all the safety features. The heated seats. The large trunk space. The tv with headsets so I don’t have to listen to spongebob. This van is THE BEST!!
563, 10 months ago,5,I have a Toyota yaris 4door car year is a 2008 automatic and I bought this car from a individual 3years ago and I absolutely love love this car they are awesome tuff cars run awesome is definitely would recommend any one that want a to buy a car buy one if these they are awesome
564, 10 months ago,5,"This is a great and powerful vehicle. Good performance, nice mileage, very good driving comfort."
565, 10 months ago,5,"I love my 4Runner- so much so that I have bought two in a row. I love the sporty look and capability mixed with some luxury. The interior hasn’t been updated in years, so I’m hoping for a redesign soon. Also, talk about retaining their value- great investment!Toyota 4Runner"
566, 10 months ago,5,I have owned Toyota vehicles the majority of my driving history. I currently own a Toyota Camry hybrid 2013. I have also owned a Toyota Prius in the past. These are very reliable cars that is taken care of correctly and maintenance will last a very long time. They don't always come with the bells and whistles but they are very safe cars that I do enjoy driving. I definitely recommend Toyota to anybody that asks for a safe and you enjoyable vehicle further and family.
567, 10 months ago,5,"Como viajar en el cuando se trata del trayecto de casa a trabajo , pero una cosa no estoy de acuerdo pero no tiene nada que ver con el modelo de auto, recomendaría este auto si el conductor manejara bien."
568, 10 months ago,3,"Good mileage. You just plug it in at night to charge it. The battery size is pretty small compared to competitors. It only seats 4, and the trunk space is tiny. Competitors seat more people and have more space. It's not convenient if you have a kid, although it's safety rating is pretty high - but you can't center-position a car seat. In my opinion, it's not a good family car. It's more sporty than people realize - the engine is great, and it's wonderful to drive. It retains value well, if you're into that sort of thing. I'd give it more like 3.5 stars if I could."
569, 10 months ago,5,Great family vehicle from a company that puts quality into their cars. Has mileage is ok for the weight and power of the vehicle
570, 10 months ago,5,"My entire family has had Toyota’s at one time or another. When they say built to last they are no lying at all. I’ve personally seen a Toyota with 300,000+ miles on running like it’s brand new. The safety features on them are great too."
571, 10 months ago,5,"You can’t get much better that a 4Runner. This is great for interstate driving and off roaming alike. Comfortable, roomy, space for all."
572, 10 months ago,5,"Shockingly comfortable and smooth to drive. The exterior is a little van like, but I completely understand the benefit for a sportier look for a larger family."
573, 10 months ago,4,"I’ve driven a 2016 as well as a 2019 rav4. I honestly prefer the older interior. It is spacious and comfortable. However, the 2019 has a roaring powerful engine that really feels nice but I hit my head when getting in and I’m only 5’6."
574, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Rav4! I have an older model, so I still have a full sized spare tire, which I have used before. Having plenty of storage space is very important as well as getting solid gas mileage. This little SUV is so versatile and has been a fantastic family car."
575, 10 months ago,5,Good family car with a lot of space. The updated models look a lot sleeker and high tech than the previous boxy models. Pretty much works as a minivan without looking like a minivan.
576, 10 months ago,5,Super versatile and reliable car. I love the size — small enough to fit into crowded city parking spots yet powerful enough to get me up the mountain to my camping destination. Fuel efficiency is pretty decent considering it’s AWD and not a hybrid.
577, 10 months ago,5,I have owned 4 different Toyota 4-Runners and I won’t own a different car ever. There are no blind spots and plenty of@room for everything.
578, 10 months ago,4,Good car. Great gas mileage and long lasting motors usually.  Family size sedan so pretty roomy and usually a step up from corollas.
579, 10 months ago,4,My boyfriend has a 2002 RAV4. It’s okay it’s old but it does the job it moves and that’s the important part. It’s not the best on gas but it’s nice
580, 10 months ago,5,This van belongs to my sister. Very roomy and comfortable. Perfect for a long family vacation. Very reliable brand! Highly recommend.
581, 10 months ago,5,Camrys are great long lasting cars. They run forever. They are roomy and comfortable. They are manufactured to last.
582, 10 months ago,5,"I love my van. It is comfortable, spacious, and great ride. The quality is awesome, and I know I will be driving it dor years to come. The only way I could possibly improve it would be to get a bit better gas millage, but honestly it still does well on mpg."
583, 10 months ago,5,"I have been driving a Prius almost since they came out I guess. I just got the newest Prius prime. Yes, my kids make fun of me for driving it. But I laughed at them when they’re buying gas every other day and I get it once every two weeks or less. It drives so smooth and silently. I love being able to plug it in and not need gas at all. Love it!￼"
584, 10 months ago,5,I’ve got a XLE 2013 and we bought it new at the time. Sucker is paid off and love it!  Zero regrets and it seats 8!
585, 10 months ago,5,Such an awesome car! I loved driving the 4Runner to the mountains. It was amazing in the snow and such an enjoyable ride. Even though it’s an suv it is super easy to drive and maneuver. Highly recommend!

587, 10 months ago,4,It was my very first self purchased car! I loved this car. It was such a good looking car. The only problem o really had was I would have to get frequent oil changes. It was a little weird.
588, 10 months ago,3,The Prius is great. It’s a very easy car to drive it. Great on gas. However as a taller person I don’t find it very comfortable.
589,10 months ago,5,"Amazing, reliable, long lasting are just some of the adjectives used to describe this car. When taken care of this car will last decades. Can’t go wrong with a Camry."
590, 10 months ago,5,"Oh do I love driving this car!  It has EVERYTHING.  I can't justify buying or leasing one as I don't have a family, but down the line, I am sure I will.  This has always been a reputable car, and sometimes I'll test drive one for S&G's to see if anything has changed - aside from modern technology and safety features, this car continues to impress me year after year."
591, 10 months ago,4,"Always handled well, but the design has turned me off from looking at it.  2 designs ago, I loved, the previous design just appalled me entirely.  While I'm liking the red-design (I want to say from the past two years), I still can't help but get my mind off of the former..."
592, 10 months ago,4,"Love, love love, handles well, and perfect off-roading car.  It also has a high resale value.  My only deterrent from competitors, would be that it has a greater risk of rolling over - an unfortunate experience I suffered years ago (in an old Explorer."
593, 10 months ago,5,I absolutely love my RAV4... it is great in snow and all types of weather. I have an older model but I think when I upgrade I am going to stay with a RAV4.
594, 10 months ago,4,"My Toyota 4 runner was wonderful,  Toyota is a great vehicle these bad boys run forever. Every time I have owned one I have it up before it quit running. In fact I have a2000 Toyota avalon sitting in my driveway still runs like a champ"

598, 10 months ago,4,I absolutely love my Camry! I researched every single affordable car and suv on the market before I decided on purchasing my 2014 Camry SE. There's honestly not much I can say I don't like about it. It's affordable and one of the longest lasting brands on the market. It also has the lowest maintenance cost due to being a well made vehicle. I would definitely recommend Toyota!  Toyota Camry 
599, 10 months ago,4,Wasn't my car but my friend has one. Thing gets her from a to b no issues and is awesome on gas. She recommends this car to me anytime I wanna trade in. Good car very reliable. Wish it was a hatch back but oh well it is good enough the way it is. 10/10 decent drive

601, 10 months ago,5,This car is a trooper. She makes it anywhere and everywhere! With a name like Matrix would you expect anything less?! There’s so much to offer when it comes to Toyota and you’ll never be let down and they are built to last!
602,10 months ago,4,I love Toyota in general. My Highlander is my favorite but the Sequoia is a close second. It’s nice and roomy and has power. It does use more gas and can be almost too big if that makes any sense?!
603, 10 months ago,5,"Learned how to park / drive in this car! Very spacious and good if you have children. Good in that it is spacious but when it comes to finding parking, most people leave smaller spots so it can be hard to squish in."
604, 10 months ago,3,Cool back up camera/radio but no button touch screen breaks or stops working and no one repairs it!! It has to be replaced for over a grand. :(  headlights get foggy faster than other vehicles I’ve had. Good on gas.

610, 10 months ago,4,Good solid car. My model didn’t have a lot of frills but it was a comfortable ride and no major mechanical issues. There was a little too much road noise while driving but that’s my only negative.
611, 10 months ago,5,Love my car! This does everything I need it to do! It drives smoothly and has not ever given me any issues!
612, 10 months ago,5,I have had my Corolla for over 10 years and it has only had regular maintenance required. I’m hoping to get many more years out of it. I love how reliable it is!

617, 10 months ago,5,"The family I nanny for let’s me use their RAV4 when I am driving their daughter around town. It has quickly become my dream car! It definitely has a lot of bells and whistles, but I’ve never felt more safe in a car ever. My goal is to get this car before having kids!"
618, 10 months ago,5,I got a 2001 Camry a few years ago. That was one of the most reliable cars I’ve ever owned. It was also one of the most affordable cars to fix. It lasted me years and I absolutely loved it. This is an amazing started car for anyone!
619, 10 months ago,4,"Very comfortable and cute! It rides really well, it’s a little bit in the smaller side but I do love that. I don’t like big SUVs so this ones I a great size. I don’t own one but I have driven them and I like them."
620, 10 months ago,5,This a really great vehicle to drive . Also it is a very reliable type of car. I don’t have to worry about the car breaking down all the time especially if it’s a minor problem and it is really easy to repair.

625, 10 months ago,3,It’s a nice family car with extra seating. Space size seems really tight and compact in the back. Not very much leg room for adults or big kids.
626, 10 months ago,5,We have a 2018 Camry and we love it. Never had any issues with it and always runs well. I do favor Toyota over Honda but both are great.
627, 10 months ago,5,This one is good my cousin has a 2003 and this work so good right now I like to leave
628, 10 months ago,5,I like the Toyota Camry. It's a very comfortable and roomy car. It's very affordable and dependable. I just  wish that it had a sportier younger feel to it.

637, 10 months ago,4,Nice car plenty of room and not to big drives and rides good. Good gas mileage all in all good car.
638, 10 months ago,5,I had a Corolla years ago and the car was great! Never gave me mechanical issues and it drove very well during snow storms in PIttsburgh! That Corolla lasted to almost 200 thousand miles and it only stopped running when it got totaled after a car accident. I recommend it!
639, 10 months ago,2,These cars are very small and no space in the back seats. If you have kids they might need more space

655,10 months ago,5,"I love my Highlander.  It is comfy and spacious. The Toyota also has so many safety features!  Blind spot protection, lane correction, ect.  I also really love that there is a 3rd row for when we have to take my kids and their friends places!!"
656, 10 months ago,5,"I review this car as a passenger, not as an owner or driver. This brand and model have stood the test of time. Both my best friend and her mother owned  Toyota Camry in the 80's. My sister and her husband loved their first one so much, they bought a second, and have continued to chose this model for the last 35 years. This mid-size sedan is good for families, as well as an upgraded touch of elegance. I have always found the seating comfortable and accommodating to all sizes and shapes, both in the front and back seats. The interior decor has always looked lovely, stylish, first class. This is a trustworthy, dependable car for city driving as well as for long distance trips. They are worth every penny."
657, 10 months ago,5,My husband used to own Toyota Corolla we love that car we used to deliver pizza in it we had the best time in our marriage listening the radio and I told you that Corona and spending the time together it was so nice I have good memories of that car

659, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota Corolla 2020 tiene un diseño nuevo que atrae, con su tecnología de seguridad. Es un carro muy confiable, atractivo y además cuenta con un legado de decir que su modelo ha sido el carro más vendido en la histiria de la industria. Es un auto muy robusto y de suspensión algo dura lo que le da mucha estabilidad, es muy suave al manejo y de excelente calidad en interiores y acabados espectaculares. Llevo años udando este marca y modelo de auto. Amo un Toyota."
660, 10 months ago,5,This is such a great little car. Especially for a commuter car. It gets the best gas mileage. It has amazing safty features too! It’s incredibly roomy too for a little car. I’m tall and I have plenty of leg room! The back seat is room too. For a “little” car it’s got “big” things about it that I love!
661, 10 months ago,5,I absolutely love my husband's 4 runner it's  4 wheel drive which will come in handy we are getting ready for a snowstorm here in Baltimore Md.  This vehicle needs no improvement its perfect.  Good on gas very roomy. I recommend this vehicle. Best vehicle ever. Toyota 4Runner

665, 10 months ago,3,Had a Toyota RAV4 many years ago and really liked it.  It was a relatively smaller car yet higher off the ground had had a good amount of storage.  The more modern versions of this car are longer and bigger than I would like.
666, 10 months ago,4,"Reliable - turn the key and it goes. It’s so pretty too. I never ever have a problem with this car. EVER. Regular maintenance and she’s good. After one bad experience with a car, needing constant repair, not this one, I appreciate this Toyota Camry very much. The only reason it’s not five stars is the car’s handling is a bit clumsy. The engine is powerful and can get me out of a jam, if need be. But it’s kinda of a boat, which is an okay exchange for its safety elements."
667, 10 months ago,5,I love my Toyota Corolla i bought the 2020 and it’s super comfortable and safe for a working college student like me.It’s also great on gas!
668, 10 months ago,5,"I adore my car. Since I live in a really rural area that gets a lot of snow, a 4wd car was a must. It’s the most reliable vehicle I’ve ever had."
669, 10 months ago,5,I love this car. You will have to yank the keys to my swagger wagon from my cold dead hands when my kids fly the nest. I run three kids deep while blasting the Hamilton cast recording in this mother. I won’t hit your car next to me in the Target parking lot with my baby carrier because of my slick sliding doors. I can carry so much stuff from Costco you won’t ever have to worry about me forgetting it’s my week to bring soccer snacks.
670,10 months ago,5,This car is so comfortable! Love how it has the map operation so you can see where you are! It has the energy emission setting which is good for the environment and doesn’t consume loads of petrol like other cars!

672, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota Camrys are a classic car, very clean design and last forever! We have had one for quite a while and it’s still going strong."
673, 10 months ago,5,Very reliable and reasonably priced car. Mine is 12 years old and still runs wells.
674, 10 months ago,5,"So roomy, and has the 8th seat for the extra child. We have drove half way across the USA in this van with 8 people and had plenty of room."

685, 10 months ago,5,"I love my car, I’ve had it for 3ish years and it’s been great. Drives great and has great mileage. I got this because corollas are super reliable and they don’t depreciate as much as other vehicles. It’s the perfect sized car and gets me from point a to point b just fine. It many be a super common car but it’s for a good reason! I love my Corolla."
686, 10 months ago,5,i want one SO BAD!! i wouldn’t even know what to do!!!!!! the whole is perfect! i was looking into getting one last year but i just share a car with my husband for now.
687,10 months ago,4,Reliable car. I love Toyota in general but the Corolla is a tad too small for my personal needs of toting cleaning supplies around and kids. Good lower price point though. Toyota is all in all the best in my opinion. It just depends on what you need when it comes to the model.
688, 10 months ago,5,My Toyota sienna is an older 2004 but runs great still! I bought it used from my boss who cared very much for it.
689, 10 months ago,5,La corollita es muy buena es económica en gasolina algún repuesto etc ademas de que son muy buenas y divinas por dentro como por fuera

691, 10 months ago,5,Love my Toyota. I had mostly Honda’s before and when I got my new car I was like why didn’t I get a Toyota sooner? My car is safe reliable and fully loaded so I am so thankful it is the complete package. I love how it came w the free services at first and the warranty. Highly recommend Toyota to anyone looking.
692, 10 months ago,5,I really like these cars and my family owns 2. I really enjoy the gas mileage and smooth drive of the car. It’s really spacious and doesn’t feel too small of a car.
693,10 months ago,4,Really good!! Drives really smooth and easy to get a hang off. The average is also really nice
694, 10 months ago,5,"Great spacious car! Good gas mileage! Newer styles are pretty sporty looking! Does well on long distance trips, too!"
695,10 months ago,5,Love my 2008 Rav4. It’s a v6 which gives it pep (newer ones are 4 cylinder only). My Rav is reliable and comfortable.
696,10 months ago,5,Love my 2012 Highlander. It is a great vehicle that easily holds seven. It’s comfortable and has amenities that I actually use. Toyota for me has always been reliable as my very first car was a 1991 Camry and it was amazing!
697, 10 months ago,5,Love our 4Runner. Added. Coke matched guard to the front and get compliments on it all the time.
698, 10 months ago,4,This is a good standard car for everyday use and long commute. It doesn’t use that much gas per gallon. It has average room.
699, 10 months ago,5,I hope it lasts forever but if it doesn’t I will buy another one. I’ve never owned a finer vehicle. Great on gas but plenty of power. Absolutely love it.
700, 10 months ago,5,I absolutely love my 2020 Camry!! It drives and rides well and my kids love all of the room in the back seat. One of the things that won me over was the huge trunk space! It also gets great gas mileage
701,10 months ago,5,"The BEST car/minivan I have ever owned!! I bought one in 2005 and it is still running strong. The pros are the safety features, the side airbags especially. The price was a little more expensive for the captains chairs and entertainment extras but well worth it foe a growing family. I wouldn't change anything and when its time I will buy another!"
702, 10 months ago,5,Very good car that is great for a first car or a family car. Offers good gas mileage and comes in cool colors. Toyota is a lifelong lasting brand that is good for all ages. Always love riding or driving this car! Toyota Camry Toyota Motor Company
703, 10 months ago,5,I love this little car for when I got with just me and my daughter as I don't need a big car for when it's just the 2 of us but it gets tight pretty fast especially with her car seat. The amount of room in the trunk is amazing I can fit so much especially with my child's stroller. What I love most about this particular car is that I don't spend a lot when it comes to gas and that is my biggest pros.
704, 10 months ago,5,I love my 4runner for me and my family it is the right amount of spacious for when we got out on our family trips. My husband also has his own but in stick shift for his job as he works in construction and it come in handy for him. Would definitely recommend this car we love it and are really happy.

706, 10 months ago,3,"Had this car for 10 years, air conditioning went out at year 5, never worked again and had it serviced all the time. It was great for fitting in small spaces, but it was TOO small for anything else"
707,10 months ago,5,I have a 2002 Toyota rav4. My grandpa passed it down to me. It gets good gas mileage. Things rarely break unless due to just being older. Parts are easy and relatively good price to get if needed. I feel safe in this car and I am short so I like how it it higher up off the road. I like how my trunk door opens to the side as opposed to up which is cool. It is roomy enough for 2-3 people. I would like to upgrade once kids are in the picture.
708, 10 months ago,4,Great. But I feel frame wise. Honda is better. Toyota feels cheaper or more plastic like than mental and solid. Mileage truly unbeatable and amazing at price point. Was able to purchase this when returning to the US from Asia after 10 years. I also wanted eco friendly. so this was a perfect choice at the time. Now Tesla time. Love the sleep inside mode so I can travel with my dogs!
709, 10 months ago,5,It feels like driving a boat it’s so smooth feels like your floating and the navigation system on the prime is just amazing don’t forget about the great fuel mileage you get and with auto park you don’t struggle one bit to get in a spot
710, 10 months ago,4,"It’s a fine car, I was a passenger so can’t complain much since I wasn’t handling the car myself."
711, 10 months ago,2,I learned to drive in a prius and no offense i feel like everyone who drives a prius cannot drive at all it’s infuriating LOL. would not buy one not a chance
712, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Camry! It has almost 150,000 miles on it and it has never given me any problems. It drives well too. The only downside is the interior doesn’t look as nice as other cars in the same price range in my opinion. The reliability makes it worth the money though."
713, 10 months ago,5,"We only have one day with it and we liked a lot of shape, space, when driving feels very good. The color and accessories of the cart are very good."
714, 10 months ago,5,Reliable little car as long as you keep up with maintenance it will last forever.  It’s a great first car for anyone especially the commuters.

719, 10 months ago,5,"I love the prius! Im actually in my 2nd prius now. I love the way the shifter looks and how different it is from other cars, how quiet it is that sometimes you cant tell its on. I actually got the prius 5 because I looove to bump my music and the prius 5 has bomb speakers to do the job! Its actually a pretty fast car too. Its also very spacious! You can drop down the back seats to make it even bigger too!Toyota Motor Company"

721, 10 months ago,5,RAV4 are the best cars!! They are amazing family cars. My sister has been in a lot of accidents in our moms RAV4 and has been protected because of this car!
722, 10 months ago,5,"I love it super convenient in fuel. Toyota came up big time with the LE model doesn’t feel or look like the cheap one of them, a lot of goodies and technology in it. The exterior looks great, super clean cuts thru the body amazing front love the grill and bumper look. And the interior looks amazing super comfortable usb and touchscreen radio."

725, 10 months ago,3,Upgrades with technology are great. Feels better than a Kia but still not as Heavy as a Benz. They last for a long time with very low maintenance.
726,10 months ago,5,I love my RAV4 so much I will probably own another one in my lifetime. You can’t go wrong with a Toyota!
727, 10 months ago,4,Great for a smaller car. Super smooth ride. Decent power. It is a nice sedan. I just prefer to be higher up off the ground.
728, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Rav4. It’s spacious, comfortable and drives smoothly. I haven’t had a single issue with it since I got it over a year ago. The safety features are really nice. Love the back up camera. It has a good amount of power for a smaller SUV. Great gas mileage."
729, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota Camry I feel is a good purchase as they are very well made. They last a long time, you can get over 200,000 miles on it if you keep up on regular maintenance.  They are average price compared to similar vehicles. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a car new or used."
730, 10 months ago,5,"me and my family own an 2004 and it’s our family truck, it’s so reliable and i love having it."
731, 10 months ago,5,"I absolutely love my Toyota 4runner. It is the perfect size SUV and the gas mileage on my vehicle is not bad for the size of it. I had a jeep before I got this and I am telling you, I will never own anything other than a 4runner again. Highly recommend!"
732, 10 months ago,4,I have always loved Toyota vehicles. Never had the privilege of owning one. But I am considering purchasing one this year. So if you have any feedback on them comment please. I've always been told if you get a good Toyota vehicle and take care of it it will last forever and I believe it !
733,10 months ago,5,LOVE THIS VEHICLE! It has the third row & 4 wheel drive. Navigations and the touch screen media center is awesome. It is a beautiful vehicle and I love driving anywhere now that this is my ride.
734, 10 months ago,4,"I love this car. I’ve never had any problems with it and I drive it multiple times a day. I also go on long 7 hour trips often. Besides my routine oil change I haven’t had an issues and I’m almost at 100,000 miles! Very dependable car"
735, 10 months ago,4,Love my little car! But the thing is it’s small and definitely best for just me. I’ll have to upgrade for a family in terms of size. It also sits low so that can be bad and good.
736, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota Corolla was the first car I owned, it was a great starter car.  It was a brand new 2008, it was everything I needed as a SR in High School.  It had wonderful gas millage and was roomy and comfortable for road trips. Would recommend for a nice first car. "
737, 10 months ago,5,I feel safe and secure driving my 2013 Toyota Camry. Its a reliable car and has been very good to me over the years. I hope to upgrade to another Camry in the next few months and will sell my car for another person to enjoy.
738,10 months ago,5,"Growing up my family was always a Toyota family, now I carry on that tradition. The vehicles themselves maybe a little costlier but they are super reliable and fuel efficient. We have friends with vehicles the same age that are in and out of garages, ours is still running and looking great."
739, 10 months ago,5,My 2018 Toyota Camry that I had was by far my favorite vehicle I've had.  It was luxury car without a huge sticker price.  The gas millage was also PHENOMINAL! I also ALWAYS felt safe in this car.  10/10 would recommend.  
740, 10 months ago,5,I love my car I just recently bought it after getting rid of my jeep and it was a great decision.
741,10 months ago,5,I love my car! The size is nice and there is plenty of room. They style is modern and has Bluetooth. The layout makes sense.
742, 10 months ago,4,"I have had no real issues with my 2016 Toyota Camry. It's reliable, comfortable, and gets good gas mileage. The only thing I don't like is how the brake pops when I'm in reverse. Evidently, this is something that is normal with Camrys. Even still, because of great value and quality, I'd definitely buy again."
743, 10 months ago,5,"This was one of my favorite vehicles we’ve owned. It got great gas mileage, drove beautifully and never gave us any problems."
744, 10 months ago,5,Good dependable and gets you where you need to go. Very efficient on gas mileage. Very good car when it is new also for to the free warranty
745, 10 months ago,5,We have had this SUV for many years and never had a moments trouble with it. We actually passed it on to our daughter because we fully trust the safety it provides.
746, 10 months ago,5,"It’s a 98 Toyota Camry with just over 100,000 miles. This vehicle has really held up to value. Besides not have any engine issues, this cars air conditioner could stand toe to toe with any 2021 vehicle. 2 or my children have drive this car and I am now the owner and I love it and will drive it till it can’t go another mile."
747, 10 months ago,5,"Easily I think the most reliable car there is out there! I’ve always been a fan of Toyota’s and have never had issues with either of my Toyota’s over the year. Truly appreciate the low maintenance, gas mileage and overall stylish look!"
748,10 months ago,5,Driving a Toyota Camry is very reliable and easy to maintain. The gas mileage is great and it’s a great car to drive for my day to day needs. It’s low cost and easy to manage. I would recommend this car who’s looking for a great budget.
749, 10 months ago,5,"We love our Sequoia. It’s big enough to hold our growing family and put all our home Reno goodies in it. We love the Toyota brand, these vehicles seem to last forever and cars that you can count on."
750, 10 months ago,4,"My friend drives a Camry and she loves. They are very nice, stylish, and dependable vehicles. I also no someone who only drive Camry’s. I’ve known her for 20 years and she has owned at least 4 Camrys in that time."
751, 10 months ago,5,I love my 2019 Corolla. Heated seats and steering wheel.. yes please! We own a Prius and a Corolla. Toyota family here. 2019 is nicer than 2020 corolla IMO
752, 10 months ago,5,We own a 2013 Prius. Super quiet car and excellent on gas. Would my family recommend? Heck yeah we would. Toyota family here.
753,10 months ago,5,"I drive a Toyota C-hr XLE it is beautiful, it is probably one of the sleekest cars that I have driven. She is a 2020 model and has all the bells and whistles. I think I love her!!! Once you drive a C-HR XLE you will definitely want to take it home."
754, 10 months ago,5,I love the 2019 version. Sleek and the dash is easy to work. Rides nice. Hardly any outside noise. And absolutely love all the safety features.
755, 10 months ago,5,Love love love this vehicle. The body on it is strong and inline any other suv. It's a vehicle you definitely feel safe in. The height on it is great also.
756, 10 months ago,5,This is a fantastic car! Very reliable and comfortable car that has great mileage and looks super nice. The price is extremely reasonable and comes loaded with fantastic features. What more do you want?
757, 10 months ago,4,"I like the corolla as a commuter vehicle. It all depends on the trim package you get I suppose to how fancy and how many “bells and whistles” you get, but all in all it’s a very solid car and I would recommend it for first time buyers."
758, 10 months ago,5,"I was driving a 2005 Toyota Camry. Was my dads then sisters and then mine. It saw rain snow you name it & it was in amazing shape before I had to get a new car. It had over 110,000 miles and still ran great."
759, 10 months ago,4,"I do love this car, it's comfortable and decently sized. I love the safety features, such a lane departure and the radar cruise control. These features help with my constant road trips from Miami to Orlando where my family lives. We've also taken this car across country from Florida to Colorado and it didn't take much gas! The only thing I wish I could change is the fact of it not having Android Auto, it does have Apple Car play but i don't own a apple phone. I have seen how the android auto works in other cars and would love for this vehicle to allow me to put my GPS on the screen instead of a wonky knock off version of Google Maps."
760, 10 months ago,5,Dope car. My dad has it and loves it. I usually drive smaller cars but driving this car is just fun. So much space great for road trips or traveling. Not that we are traveling much now due to covid but still a good car.
761, 10 months ago,5,"I’m 22 and just bought my first car aka not a car that used to be my dads car haha. I have the 2017 Corolla and it’s been great so far. Such a wonderful first car. The monthly plan I have is very reasonable for a recent college grad. Reliable car, have had no issues with it so far. Toyota Corolla"
762, 10 months ago,5,"It is a great car for me and my dog. It runs great, the con is the gas mileage but it handles well in snow and the maintenance cost is so minimal"
763, 10 months ago,5,I love my Corolla. This is my second Corolla and it has always been a great and reliable car
764, 10 months ago,5,"Was debating for a long time whether to get a Camry or accord. Although I went with the accord, the Camry is a really great vehicle too. The interior is super spacious and comfortable for passengers and driver as well. The exterior of the newer models looks really nice, like you get your money’s worth. Defiantly love the safety features it offers."
765, 10 months ago,5,Awesome ride not too big for an SUV.  The inside is very roomy and there is plenty of room for storage.  The price tag isn't too bad with all of the amenities that are offered.  
766, 10 months ago,3,The car rides smoothly. It has one of the best safety ratings on the market. The pedal is sensitive. You will be going 60mph before you know it. Cars is made to last forever
767, 10 months ago,5,It ran nicely.  I liked the touch screen display.  This is my grandmother's car and she isn't tech savvy. So it's very user friendly
768, 10 months ago,4,"Ive borrowed my parents Camry... It's great on gas, tons of get up and go... It isn't ergonomical though... The steering wheel is clunky with too many buttons"
769, 10 months ago,4,"I've never owned a Toyota Prius, but I've been a passenger in one many times.  I absolutely loved the concept of the Prius, and I've often thought of getting a Prius myself in order to lessen my footprint on the environment, and lessen the toll the cost of gas is taking on my wallet - particularly living in California.  I'm originally from Texas, and gas prices here are nothing like they are in Texas!  I took one star off for the Prius though because, as I said, I have been in MANY of my friends' Prius' - and often the occasion happens to be during long roadtrips to music festivals like Outside Lands in San Francisco where the drive is between Los Angeles and Golden Gate Park.  The drive in a Prius is often an hour or two longer in a packed Prius, than it would be in a fully gas-powered car.  You can just feel the little Prius struggle against the weight and the hills.  Even Los Angeles to Las Vegas can be a struggle with 4 fully grown adults and their suitcases in the desert heat.  You can hear the Prius sputter and the heat crackle outside.  So -- I didn't want to be a killjoy.  Saving the environment is important.  And at the end of the day, it only adds about an hour to your journey.  So I only knocked off one star.   Toyota Prius  "
770, 10 months ago,5,"I absolutely love the Toyota 4Runner.  This was the first car I got when I turned 16. It was absolutely the best car.  I loved it so much.  My parents leased it for me under a 3 year lease because my birthday was in September, so the lease was up right when I went away to college.  The car drove so smoothly, I was high up off the ground which made me feel really secure for my first years on the road.  The other thing I really liked about the car was that it was not a super wide SUV, it felt more like a car in terms of width, which also made it easy to turn for a first time driver, as well as easy to park.  Likewise it was not super long, so 3 point turns were never a huge issue in parking lots.  And did I love to go up to those shopping centers with my girlfriends and hang out.  Those were the days :)   Toyota 4Runner "
771, 10 months ago,5,Very spacious and great if you are a big family !! Very comfortable for everyone in the car
772, 10 months ago,5,"I haven’t had any problems with the Camry yet. I have had it for almost 10 years. Spacious, easy to drive, and easy to maintain."
773, 10 months ago,4,Estos carros son muy buenos y confortable para una familia de 4 o 5 personas llegas rápido a los lugares y a demás su precio es bueno no son tan caros se los recomiendo muchísimo la verdad porque son buenos y siempre necesitas tener un carro si tienes una familia grande 
774, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Yaris! Initially we got it for the gas mileage and comfort, but it also has an amazing amount of room when you fold the seats down. We hauled a side table and a dresser with room to close the trunk!! I highly recommend and would buy a new Yaris when this one dies!"
775, 10 months ago,5,We have owned a Prius now for 3 years.  It is a fun car and so quiet.  My husband loves it and glad we decided on it when we were looking for a new car
776, 10 months ago,5,Toyota cars have always been a safe reliable car that I feel comfortable driving my kids around in. They also last a long time!
777, 10 months ago,5,My first car. I’ve had it for 3 years now; bought it used. It felt new. It’s held up so well over the years - just regular maintenance. I live about 40 minutes from my work - the Corolla is great on gas’s. Toyota Corolla  - I know I’m going to need to upgrade and I won’t even consider another make.
778, 10 months ago,5,"My very first car was a Toyota Camry and when I traded it in it had 399,000 miles on it I loved that car blue interior and all!"
779, 10 months ago,4,Great ride! Fun car and great for long trips. We always had a blast on road trips and girls weekends! Super easy ride and super roomy.
780, 10 months ago,4,Love this car. It was my very first brand new car (always had old ones you get get for 1000 on Craigslist). I loved everything about it I leased it twice!
781, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Rav4!  4 wheel drive is essential living up north in the snowy conditions, It’s the perfect size & has everything i could ever need!"
782,10 months ago,4,"Loved the RAV4, very nice drive, nice interior and  pretty good on gas.  I love that it’s not to big and it’s all wheel drive.  I would recommend this car and I might purchase again."
783, 10 months ago,5,very safe a durable. i have had my car for years and it gets great mileage and has little to no issues. it is super easy to drive as well
784, 10 months ago,5,I love my Highlander. It’s comfortable and it has enough technology to accommodate my tastes. It fits my 2 kids’ car seat next to each other with room for an extra passenger on a window seat. It drives amazingly and it is safe even in winter snow storm. Honestly the best car I’ve driven.
785, 10 months ago,4,"En mi opinión esconfortable y seguro,se siente ligero y tranquilo.Es una buena opción para ir en familia"
786, 10 months ago,5,"I have always loved Toyota and would truly LOVE an FJ Cruiser as my own. I have ridden with my friend, who is a photographer, to many locations in this gorgeous automobile. It is luxurious yet rugged. We've taken it off-road on private land where no vehicle has ever driven, and where most would not he capable! It can fit a ton of stuff and/or a ton of people. It performs like a Jeep but rides so smooth it feels like a BMW. And, it has no problen getting stuck in mud and muck."
787, 10 months ago,5,Awwwe mini!! We have this and it’s so easy to drive. It gets decent gas mileage. It’s comfy and lots of room.
788, 10 months ago,5,I absolutely love my Corolla I am a big fan of Toyota my father has a Tacoma which was a reason I bought a corolla
789,10 months ago,4,"Very nice and roomy car.  It’s a long lasting car which will most likely last over 130k miles.  Inexpensive to maintain, easy to find replacement parts and good on gas."
790,10 months ago,3,"Good car, smooth and easy drive and good on gas.  I’m not a fan of the look but it’s a car that will last for many many years.  Inexpensive to maintain.  I would recommend this car."
791,10 months ago,4,"Love driving this car, it’s an easy and smooth drive.  Excellent on gas, and so quiet.  I would purchase Prius again for long commutes.  Only negative is that the battery is expensive to replace."
792, 10 months ago,5,Such a great family car! It is specious and kid friendly and uses less gas than other cars.
793, 10 months ago,5,"I used to sell Honda’s for a few months, and even then I learned how superior Toyota’s are. I never liked the older designes, but when the 2019 model came out, it was perfect. I was driving a Nissan Altima and the transmission and engine blew out and left me a few minutes from a Toyota dealership and I decided to get a Camry. I drive 400 miles a week for work and my car and I have yet to have any issue. It is the best car I have ever owned."
794, 10 months ago,4,Great car for the value. Very inexpensive to fix the car. It drives alright. The headlights could be brighter however
795, 10 months ago,5,These are awesome SUV and tons of roof and handle very well at 95 ..Had the most fun driving to Florida and back in this SUV.great traveling suv
796, 10 months ago,5,Beautiful car and would love to have one ..was super fun driving and loved it was a hybrid. Kinda wish we had gotton it instead of the Toyota Corolla we purchase.
797, 10 months ago,5,I love my 2019 Toyota Corolla se its the best car ive bought.gas saver and getter and stylish and has everything I could want in it plus the reverse camera is nice to have.. Toyota Corolla
798, 10 months ago,5,Love this car. So many amazing features to add on. Would love to have one of my own. Or to test out for a week 
799, 10 months ago,5,I LOVE my Corolla. Not only is it affordable it has done so so well for me by being reliable. Having many features as well as the comfort level! 
800,10 months ago,5,My first car that I've owned. Love how it can fit so many things but not feel like you're driving a giant vehicle. It's zippy and great! I've had a lot of friends and family members who've ridden with me and have mentioned they regret getting their compact car after seeing how good my car is
801, 10 months ago,2,I’m not a huge fan of Toyota’s so I’m not going to give it an amazing rating but their cars definitely look nice just not for me
802, 10 months ago,5,This is a nice sporty vehicle but also very family friendly. Nice and comfortable and good on gas.
803, 10 months ago,5,"Absolutely amazing! Just so sporty but regal too. I love driving it too, really smooth."
804, 10 months ago,5,This is the roomiest and best car there is. For someone who prefers trucks this is the only car I’ve ever actually loved!
805, 10 months ago,5,"I have a 98 highlander and I live it. My only complaint is that it is before a lot of the extra controls that are amazing such as Apple play and its competitors. Other than that this car will be hard for me to give up. I think I have the most attachment to it because of all the memories it has been through with my family and me. Also, it’s just a great car. It will be hard to replace one day."
806, 10 months ago,5,"Simply one of the best trucks.  My truck is a 1997 and runs so good. I think they are very good on gas and are spacious. We just had issues with spark plugs popping, but that’s it. I will say Toyota’s are worth the money you pay. They last a long time. I will purchase another 4Runner after this one no longer runs.  Toyota 4Runner Toyota 4Runner "
807, 10 months ago,5,"I've had my Toyota Yaris since 2008 and my car has never failed me. I do the yearly maintenance and this has hands down been the best car I've every owned. I would definitely recommend a Toyota and a Yaris. The car may be small, but I would take a small car over a car that doesn't work when I need it. "
808,10 months ago,5,"It’s a really good SUV, it’s not huge, perfect size. Spacious, and safe, not that good with gas in the city"
809, 10 months ago,5,This car has been through the ringer and still going. Everything seems to need fixing on it but it still keeps going. Very reliable
810, 10 months ago,5,I switched from a Ford to a rav4 I love the space and the comfort! The inside is really nice and the Toyota technology is the best!
811, 10 months ago,5,"Me encanta este tipo de auto es muy cómodo, además de bello muy resistente si lo sabes cuidar perfectamente para una familia de 4"
812, 10 months ago,3,"Purchased a New Toyota Highlander in 2018 when I was a mother of 1 with twins on the way. Initially, I thought it would have plenty of room. But I was wrong - the very back is very uncomfortable for my slender 13 year old. I have twins sitting forward facing in boosters that are tethered in - this means my oldest needs to crawl in from the back or through the narrow space between the captain seats. Not practical. And I can’t move both my twins to the 3rd row because there’s only on anchor - in the middle. Long story short, not practical if you have 3 or more children and 2 of those children in car seats."
813, 10 months ago,5,"Great car, extremely fuel efficient, and thus far has held up with virtually no problems. I’ve had mine since 2016 and have no complaints."
814, 10 months ago,5,I have a 2000 used toyota camry that I bought for very cheap from a.family.friend. But I love it for daily errands. I like that it is compact with decent space inside. It's not super spacious but it's good enough for my toddler. As the driver it probably nicer than the passengers though. Lol it's lasted forever and hopefully continues to! It's a good car to have if you're on a budget! Like me 😎
815, 10 months ago,4,very nice. smooth drive and love the interior. very classy without the massive price tag. lols. but nice drive love it
816, 10 months ago,4,"I have a 4 Runner with the 3rd row. We live by the beach that we can drive on and not far from the mountains. We got this car after replacing our AWD SUV, and this is so much better driving on the beach. We would get stuck a lot in our AWD. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles some other SUV's have, and accessing the 3rd row is a little challenging, but we are thankful for the space with our family and carpooling friends."
817, 10 months ago,5,"I just love by car, I don't feel that I spend a lot of money on repairs I feel that the quality of my vehicle speaks for itself, it's not in the repair shop is on the road with all my kids I love the third seat when grandmother wants to come I stick the kids in the back and everybody has a lot of room if you're looking for SUV family car look no further and funny enough is the same color eggplant not as not a boring Black hides all the scratches did the kids may do."
818, 10 months ago,5,"I love everything about Toyota and the 4Runner! If I didn’t have so many children, I would definitely Have a 4Runner instead of my expedition. Lol. The 4Runner is smooth riding and very dependable! Plenty of space and it is such a sharp looking vehicle. Totally recommend"
819, 10 months ago,5,"I’m not a car person. I am an SUV, big vehicle/Truck person.. I have never liked being in a smaller car... until I got my new Camry. This car is the perfect size, is roomy (even with 3 kids) and has plenty of trunk space for grocery trips! I love the gas mileage, drivability, the peppiness of the engine & the reliability. The ONLY recommendation that I have (and it’s a very minor one) is that I wish my window and door lock buttons lit up on the driver door panel.. it’s really hard to see which button you’re pushing at night. BUY A CAMRY if you’re looking for a car. I am so happy with mine!"
820, 10 months ago,1,It was okay very small and things broke a lot but overall it ran ok. I would never buy one though
821, 10 months ago,5,"I have 2008 Solara Camry Convertible which I love. They don’t make them anymore, but I wish they did. This car has 70000 miles and runs great."
822, 10 months ago,3,Test drove one and was a smooth driving vehicle. Major downside is it’s super small my oldest kid absolutely hated it the wasn’t enough room for her in the back
823, 10 months ago,3,"I had a 2007 Prius was absolutely wonderful for gas mileage. But, my hybrid battery started to go out and it’s so expensive that it would cost more to fix it than what the car was actually worth."
824, 10 months ago,5,Super roomy and I'm in love with it.  This will be my next vehicle purchase.  I love the features and the extra row.  Also i love how there is still trunk space with the third row in use!! Can't wait to be able to own one in the future!!
825, 10 months ago,5,"I love this car. I have a 2013, and with a few modifications (we added a screen that has Android auto) this car is just like any car that I could drive off the lot today. The sun/moon roof is awesome, and one of my favorite things is to ride with all the windows down (front, back, sun/moon roof, even the window on the hatch)."
826,10 months ago,5,Best car! If you are new driver this is the car that you going to love! I love my car and I’m driving everywhere with it 🚘
827, 10 months ago,5,"Love my Rav4. Its drives well, no major mechanical issues, only regular maintenance. The best feature is the cruise control. It shows down and speeds up for you. Great value for the price. My last 3 cars were Toyota and never an issue!"
828, 10 months ago,4,"Toyotas are built to last! I feel very safe driving it compared to other 4 door sedans. It’s not great on fuel efficiency, but I do have an older model. Customer service and Toyota dealers are helpful and professional. Toyotas are on the pricy side."
829, 10 months ago,5,"So so so great on gas mileage. Small and compact but big enough to haul myself, my twin 6 year old girls and all of our extras."
830, 10 months ago,5,"I always loved this car back in college, and the recent models are so pretty and spacious!!"
831, 10 months ago,5,I love my SUV! It rides so nice & it runs amazingly! I love all the extras on my car!
832, 10 months ago,4,I’ve had my Corolla for 9 years now and it has been a trusted car that has not given me many problems over the years. Very reliable.
833, 10 months ago,5,My brother in law owns one and it has a mean and sporty look! It is big and quite comfy to sit as a passenger.
834, 10 months ago,5,I own 2019 highlander XLE! I love it! Has great features and perfect for my family 5 and sometimes 6. Enough legroom and enjoy for long travel!
835, 10 months ago,5,My mom loves this car and how smoothly it runs!! The color and the interior is great.
836, 10 months ago,4,It's a nice van but it's 6v chicharrón takes up a lot of gas. And it's expensive. It does have a lot of room to be comfortable. The only thing is that the back seats can lay completly down so you can't really sleep 😴 on long trips. But I would recomend it for a family bigger than 4
837, 10 months ago,5,"This is my car. I really love to drive with it. Its nice looking, don't eating much, have a lot of space. I really enjoy it. I don't think she's got the minuses. I only see good things in her. It's not expensive, but I definetly recommend it."
838, 10 months ago,5,The Camry is a good everyday vehicle. Handles really good.  Good midsize sedan. Very good on gas.  Good value foe the price point.
839, 10 months ago,3,I love the look of the 4Runner. It is very spacious. This vehicle is actually on a truck frame.  The dashboard and entertainment center is very outdated.  Didn’t pair well with my iPhone.  Good vehicle for a person that loves a big and roomy vehicle.
840, 10 months ago,5,I just bought this vehicle 2 months ago.  I traded in my 4Runner. I found the highlander to be the perfect size SUV.  It’s very roomy for the size. It has a lot of safety features which is most important to me.  The gas mileage is great as well.  Good price point for all of the standard features this vehicle is equipped with.  The safety features helped with my auto insurance premium as well. I’ve purchased many vehicles and I’d have to say this vehicle is at the top of my favorites mainly because of the safety features.
841, 10 months ago,5,"It’s a really nice car! I’m very comfortable with the smooth steering, and the size is perfect for me."
842, 10 months ago,5,"One of my family members currently own it. I like how it drives, feels comfortable, easy to manage. The car is too low for sometimes too bumpy roads depending on the area which can be impractical in terms of damages. But other than that it’s a cool car"
843, 10 months ago,5,My rav4 was so good to me. Never gave me expensive issues or worried me that I'd be left stranded somewhere. Perfect first mom car too. I had a 2007 so not heavy on the bells and whistles but had everything I needed at the time. I love how much room I had when I folded the seats flat and I really miss the under carriage storage. It was 11 years old with over 150k miles and still going strong but I decided to trade it in.
844, 10 months ago,5,"Rented this for a road trip and had a smooth ride. If you want an SUV that’s not too big, I recommend it!"
845,10 months ago,5,Upgrade from a Corolla! Smooth and nice and the price is amazing! Toyota definitely has everything covered under their brand
846,10 months ago,5,It’s a nice car for the price and runs really smooth! For me I need a car to take me from Point A to Point B and this is car does just that!
847, 10 months ago,5,I have the 2015 edition that includes the back up camera which is my favorite feature. It also has a nice amount of space inside as well as in the trunk.
848, 10 months ago,5,"Good size, nice car, hybrid saves you money on gas. Great mileage, easy to get around. Lots of options to add on to the car. Just be prepared to be nickel and dimes if something does go wrong."
849, 10 months ago,4,"Great mileage lasted a long time and large number of miles on the engine, however it gets expensive for repairs. The sun visor broke off one day and the dealership wanted almost $500 to fix it. They like to nickel and dime you"
850, 10 months ago,5,"I love camrys. They are such reliable cars, and they last for years. It’s my favorite sedan. If I didn’t have a SUV, I would have a camry. It’s a beautiful, chic car that runs well. It’s a great car for any age."
851, 10 months ago,5,Love this car so much. It’s very reliable and durable. Great for long trips with the family and fits everyone inside comfortably. I highly recommend.
852,10 months ago,5,Great vehicle long lasting with fair bit of room inside comfortable seats  very bright headlights great for night driving
853,10 months ago,5,I absolutely love my Toyota highlander.  I chose it because I can haul my entire family around in it and pull my camper.  It also has a backup camera so I can line up the hitch by myself.  I love the sunroof and it has all around been a wonderful car for my family.
854, 10 months ago,5,A very smooth vehicle with quite a bit of options.  Looks good also not like a box.  Very comfortable for long trips with lots of leg room.
855, 10 months ago,3,"My first car was a Toyota Corolla. When i tell you this car is reliable! She might be small but she has power. It will always bring you from point a to point b. When it come to gas, a full tank will bring you a LONGGGG way and it does not cost a lot to full. The only thing for was that i had to roll down my windows manually loll"
856, 10 months ago,4,Love my little Toyota! Purchased new in 2013 in Alpine white. It gives great gas mileage and it’s a comfortable ride. A good sized interior with enough leg room in both the front and back seat. Great sized trunk as well. Not 100% happy with the paint as I have had some issues with rust in very odd places (that wouldn’t normally rust) and it wasn’t part of the paint recall so they would fix it. I would definitely consider Toyota in the future again.
857, 10 months ago,5,"So far this is the best car, I had 2 of these and they are Amazon, they have enough space it is comfortable for long road trips and is fully equipped I now own the 2021 and it is Amazing it offers so much including a charging pad, a bench, gas distance it’s expensive but worth buying"
858, 10 months ago,5,"Great dependable car with lot's of features and airbags, I would recommend to anyone with kinda expensive but dependable."
859, 10 months ago,5,I had a cambry 1994 5 years ago it had more than 200k miles but it worked so good unfortunately I had to sell it because we didn't fit anymore but if i ever but a car again it will be a Toyota
860, 10 months ago,5,Nice car comfortable and affordable. Everyone should get it and hybrid also so less gas
861, 10 months ago,5,Loved the seats works nice nothing compare to Toyota. Best for any new drivers also affordable price
862, 10 months ago,5,Looks like an amazing car. Drove this car from my friend loved the interior. Wish could afford it
863,10 months ago,5,My family has had many Toyota’s because they run so well and for many many miles. The trunk space is what is so nice if you have kids. Price is reasonable. It runs excellently is the most important part.
864, 10 months ago,3,"Ehh I don't like Toyota, its my moms car. I drive it because my boyfriend is being a slacker on fixing mine."
865, 10 months ago,4,This is a good car and very good I really recommend it to you guys that are trying to buy a car
866, 10 months ago,5,I purchased a 2009 Toyota corolla and was in a severe car accident. The car saved my life and that of my passenger.  I turned around and purchased another as my car was a total loss. my car loan was paid off and I had equity... greatest purchase of my life.
867, 10 months ago,5,"I love my FJ. I originally owned a 2007 but someone hit me on the freeway totaling. Thankfully, the FJ performed and protected me with its multiple airbags and sturdy frame. I fought with insurance as it was impossible to replace with their payout as they had discontinued but was finally able to replace with a 2012. Substantial price difference but Still a great vehicle and love the few changes that were made between my two. I’m asked regularly if I’m willing to sell but the answer will always be no."
868,10 months ago,5,"Omg I just bought the Toyota RAV4 2021 this car is amazing, it drives itself on cruise control steering itself between the lanes, I got the gxl and really if your not towing anything massive it’s the perfect car for you, it has wireless charging, tinted windows, leather accented steering wheel, I got the option to upgrade my seats to leather, custom rims, it’s the best first car I could’ve purchased"
869, 10 months ago,5,"Eu acho esse carro totalmente confortável, quando você está dirigindo você nem sente a pressão que geralmente outros carros possuem, o único problem pra mim é que ele é muito grande então noção de espaço fica um pouco complicado."
870, 10 months ago,5,I love love my car! It’s super cozy for an SUV! It’s the perfect size for a small family! We use it for road trips and everything! Mine has a luggage rack on top for our kayaks too! The selling point for me though was the mileage! I’ve never spent so little on gas! I drive every day and still only have to fill up about once every 2 weeks! I bought mine in 2019 new and it was such a great price! You can’t beat it for all it comes with! I love that Toyota is built to last! My family has been driving them for generations!
871,10 months ago,5,"I don’t where i should start about Toyota. One of the most reliable, stylish and comfortable vehicles in the world. If you are in the market for a good bang for your buck definitely check this out"
872, 10 months ago,4,"I used a Corolla regularly for about two months as a rental when my car had been in a bad accident. It was a fine sedan - nothing wrong with it that I noticed at all. It was fairly comfortable and did everything it was supposed to. That being said, it was just kind of...meh, nothing exciting or special. But definitely not bad!"
873, 10 months ago,1,"Have to give this vehicle a 1 star. We have had numerous issues since day one and we only have 73,000 miles on her. EVERYTHING under the hood is new and we still have issues. I think Toyota is a good brand but will NEVER get another Scion again. WORST.VEHICLE.EVER!"
874, 10 months ago,5,"I've only ever driven this car as a rental but I like them,and Toyota in general,very much. Very comfortable and lots of good e tras but a bit pricey. However they are great cars with excellent gas mileage and can easily put hundreds of thousands of miles on them with proper maintenance."
875, 10 months ago,5,"I've only driven these new a few times as rentals or loaner cars but I really like them. They're very comfortable. Drive great,have nice features and can easily fit 5 people comfortably. The only con I know of is the price. Toyota is one of the best cars,with both great gas mileage and they can have 300,000 miles and still run great with proper maintenance!"
876, 10 months ago,5,"Believe it or not but I had a Yaris up until a couple years ago and it was a really,really good car! It had no extras,heck it still had crank windows,but it could take a beating! It's a very affordable car. It's great on gas, comfortable, and rides nice. It's not great for more than one passenger though but it's the only real con. I definitely recommend if you're not looking to spend a lot but want that Toyota quality!"
877, 10 months ago,5,I am so close to buying a car!! This may be my next one! My friend has one and I just can’t believe how many miles she gets!! It’s roomy
878, 10 months ago,4,"my sister got this car a couple years ago and love it. for me, it’s a little smaller than I would prefer, there is not a whole lot of leg room. but, it’s great for people who live in cities who need something small to drive around."
879, 10 months ago,5,"my mom has had this car for nearly 10 years and it’s still running today. she drives 2 hours, 5 days a week and she swears by her camry. while we may be getting a new car soon, the camry has been one of the best cars we’ve had."
880,10 months ago,5,"Este carro me encanto porque tiene mucho espacio, para familias de ocho personas es magnífico, tiene mucha fuerza en el motor y eso es bueno, lo que no me gusta es su forma como cuadrada, pero eso es cuestión de gustos. Sin duda lo recomiendo. Es ideal para viajes lejos"
881,10 months ago,3,"Nothing special, it didn’t have a great engine. I had lots of problems with maintenance. Wouldn’t buy again"
882,10 months ago,5,"Es un carro muy bueno, de los mejores que he tenido, ha durado por más de 10 años en la familia y ya estaba bien viejo y seguía funcionando muy bien, la verdad es un carro que en el mercado aparece con un precio muy alto pero vale la pena comprarlo, no dudaría en comprarlo de nuevo"
883,10 months ago,4,"I wish I did some more research on this car,  I do love how it’s drives and looks I just don’t exactly need a full sized sedan for my lifestyle! Everyone at the dealership was super friendly however!!! Toyota Camry"
884, 10 months ago,5,Can’t go wrong with this make and model. Smooth ride and these cars last for years. I’ve never met a Toyota I didn’t like 👍
885, 10 months ago,5,"I been having a Toyota for 3 years now, never had an issue with my car, gets me everywhere I need to go, if I ever buy another car it will be another Toyota!"
886, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Toyota Corolla! I have the 2016 Toyota Corolla S Plus, which is the sports model. The gas mileage is great, the repair is not costly, and the overall cost of the car is very reasonable. I would definitely recommend a Toyota Corolla, or any Toyota for that matter!"
887, 10 months ago,5,"Love my car!! It doesn't have all of the modern day bells and whistles, but it has been nothing but good to me. Reliable and decent on gas mileage."
888, 10 months ago,5,"This is my second rav4 to own. Reliable, and cute to boot! It's the perfect size for an suv for a small girl. Highly recommend."
889, 10 months ago,5,"i’ve owned this car for several years now and it still runs like it’s brand new. the gas pedal is very touchy, however, so it’s a little difficult to get used to at first. but that could just be my car in specific and other cars of the same make and model aren’t like that. i don’t know much about cars. anyway, the seats are super comfortable and firm, the front seats really support your back."
890, 10 months ago,5,"I own a 2009 model and it's a great, roomy little car. Excellent on gas, touchy with the gas pedal and great break reaction. Roll up windows instead of power windows but this works out well for a dog owner who's dog figures out power windows (ha!)."
891, 10 months ago,5,I own a Toyota Corolla 2005 and it's old but still in a very good shape. It's very gas economic and with a nice size trunk. Perfect to save money on gas when going to work.
892, 10 months ago,5,I have a Toyota Camry 1997LE I love it for things to be used it’s just about over to me and it still runs today that’s a miracle but honestly considering all things never been in a wreck but it just works so good I love this car￼.
893, 10 months ago,5,"I own a 2008 Scion HD. Limited Series, only 2000 made. I love the special paint, hot lava. The car is great, I just wish the storage space was a little bigger. Having 3 kids makes grocery trips rough to get all the bags in the truck. But other than that it’s amazing!"
894, 10 months ago,4,A little small for my tastes (I have big legs) but if you’re traveling with 3 or 4 people in it it’s amazing
895, 10 months ago,5,"TOYOTA SIEMPRE HA SIDO UNA MARCA CONFIABLE PARA MI,CUANDO LLEVO MI CARRO A LA AGENCIA,RESUELVEN EL PROBLEMA RÁPIDO Y CON EFICIENCIA,Y ESTE CARRITO LO TENGO HACE 10 AÑOS,Y ESTÁ EN BUEN ESTADO"
896,10 months ago,5,I love love my truck my husband has a Tacoma. And I loved driving his truck it only made sense have kids we would want something similar to his truck and that makes me feels safe in.
897,10 months ago,5,"Me encanta mi carro, responde rápidamente cuando tocas el acelerador. No he tenido problemas de motor ni de transmisión. Solo cambiar las gomas y baterías. Excelente vehículo quiero el nuevo Camry"
898, 10 months ago,5,"Can’t go wrong with a good old Camry!! These cars are made to last. Safe, comfortable, spacious and efficient!"
899,10 months ago,5,Me encanta quisiera dar un paseo pero no creo que sea posible se ve muy interesante y grande serviría para acampar
900, 10 months ago,5,My Toyota Rav 4 has been a great purchase. I have owned it for several years and not had a single problem with the car itself outside of routine maintenance. I was looking for dependability and specific features and feel I got that with the Rav 4.
901,10 months ago,4,"Es un auto cómodo en interior, aunque bastante espacioso para estacionar en cualquier lado, no estoy segura de la calidad por el precio en cuanto a uso de combustible, ya que lo he usado de pasajera."
902,10 months ago,4,"El auto es muy cómodo, compacto a comparación de otros de cuatro puertas. No es muy largo ni necesita gran cantidad de espacio, tiene cuatro cilindros, por lo que ahorra gasolina. Las manijas de las puertas son un problema, ya que no son tan resistentes, he tenido que cambiarlas en varias ocasiones que  he tenido eventos familiares y subo otras personas, que dejan el seguro puesto o cierran las puertas y otros no se fijan ni tienen cuidado, y con el mínimo jalón se quebran. Pero en general es un buen automóvil, no requiere demasiado mantenimiento. Los amortiguadores es otra cosa delicada que tienen, no sirven del todo por mucho tiempo, ni es para usarlos en calles con baches constantemente; fuera de eso es un auto ideal para la ciudad y una familia pequeña."
903,10 months ago,5,"Absolutely love my Toyota RAV4. Mine is in the lunar rock color and is the XLE Premium. I love the sporty interior and all of the bells and whistles my car came with. It feels super safe to drive and I’m obsessed with it. The cargo area is really spacious too! There are some amazing safety features and it’s got great visibility. I will always recommend this car to anyone on the market looking for a fun, reliable car."
904, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota has always been in my opinion the most reliable vehicles. The Toyota 4runner is an amazing SUV that I easily put over 300,000k miles on it, drove it cross country twice and fully intend on investing in another Toyota 4runner in the future."
905, 10 months ago,5,"There’s no other vehicle on the market like a Toyota 4 Runner Limited Edition.  Long lasting, beautiful, rugged look and a great price, you’re sure to be a life long fan of the Toyota products."
906, 10 months ago,4,"This is a good compact car for every day use. It is affordable in gas consumption. The down side is that it is not AWD, however investing in a good pair of snow tires makes this car great."
907, 10 months ago,5,This was an awesome car! A Toyota celiac was my very first car I purchased on my own! I loved it! Sporty and fun but also safe.
908, 10 months ago,5,The space in a Toyota Camry is AMAZING! The comfort and the looks of the car truly matches what I look for
909, 10 months ago,5,"I honestly have so much love for Toyota! How smooth they drive and the comfort of the inside truly feels amazing. Depending on the preferences of the driver, I truly feel like Toyota has options for anyone."
910, 10 months ago,5,These are a very clean ride and very spacious on the inside. They are very fuel efficient and they are a very smooth drive! It is a great sedan for the price! New or used the older models are super nice too I would buy one
911, 10 months ago,4,"I love this car, it drives really well and does the job for our family. We primarily use it for commuting and weekend errands. I wish a few of the features were easier like popping the trunk and syncing my phone. I also wish there were more cup holders and charger ports but it’s ok."
912, 10 months ago,4,"I haven’t personally owned a Toyota Corolla, but my grandmother has had one for a number of years. I’ve driven her car numerous times, and I’m definitely a fan. Handles well, spacious, smooth ride, and the price isn’t too crazy."
913, 10 months ago,5,"My parents owned a Camry 3x, they loved it so much. I have some of my best memories from being in our Camry. I really miss the vintage seat print."
914, 10 months ago,5,Many in my family have a Prius. Super easy to use and intuitive to users of all ages. Easy handling and quiet which is nice.
915, 10 months ago,4,This car is ok! It’s good when you have a lot of children and for hikes or road trips.
916,10 months ago,4,"Comfortable, nice ride not bumpy and very safe to drive, soft steering and comes in a selection of colors, I wish it had a better stereo system"
917, 10 months ago,5,"I love my rap for so much that I am on my second one my first one I drove over 270,000 mi before trading it in for my new one. This car is amazing it has plenty of room for that weekend getaway. Or getting the kids to the field. The gas mileage on it is amazing. I drive mine back and forth to work daily but I also gone very long road trips throughout the summer. It is never failed me. Just keep up on the maintenance and you're good to go. Can't wait to buy my next one."
918,10 months ago,5,"So I had 1985 i think I can't remember celiac gt and let me tell you I loved this car so much....yes there was a lot of work done at first and yes there were times things broke and needed to be fix. But hey it was an older car. But I absolutely loved this car so much and I wish I still had it. It was reliable and got me to where I needed to go. The only reason I don't have it, is cause life happened and I need to let go of the car. But 100% I would recommend this car to someone. Old cars are the best...I wouldn't mind trying a new one."
919, 10 months ago,5,I just  got it this year I love it it a gas saver and tank fills up within and I am good  for the whole  week 😌 love it
920, 10 months ago,5,"Great car for the money, roomy with a large trunk area. Has pretty good gas mileage. Car is easy to maintain. Repairs can be minimized by keeping up with maintenance. Smooth ride and accessories are reasonably priced."
921, 10 months ago,5,I used to own a Toyota Camry. A very ok’d one 2001 exactly. But it was the most reliable car ever and perfect first car!
922, 10 months ago,5,I love the Toyota Camry. You get a nice compact car that’s also roomy and good on gas mileage. The trunk space is more than enough for me and I would definitely own one. I loved the rental.
923,10 months ago,5,Toyotas are very reliable everyone of my family has one and doesn’t usually have any problems with them￼
924,10 months ago,5,"it's a good car, but the reality is that I didn't use it much, I don't drive too much, I hardly have to,but it's a good car"
925, 10 months ago,5,"I just got the 2020 RAV4 Limited this year and I LOVE it!!! Heated seats and side mirrors, assisted parking, sunroof, good on gas, and the touch screen is awesome! I’ve had her for almost 5 months and I still have so much to learn!"
926, 10 months ago,5,"I love this make of car. I still think the best Candy was 2016. It was beautiful body shape and the last year completely made in Japan. If you can find used and in good V shape, get it. The 2017 was also good car, but the seals started to separate. The armrests on the door started to come free. Now I have 2019 Camry and it is more compact inside and less cargo space, but excellent gas mileage. Toyota makes a great car. Never leave you stranded. Drive smooth."
927, 10 months ago,5,I own a 2010 XLE Camry and I love this type of car because it saves me gas and it’s reliable. The interior of the car is beautiful and it’s spacious. I will purchase another Camry in the future.
928, 10 months ago,5,"Amazing family car! A lot of space, comfortable even for a long drive! Super reliable! Limited packaging makes it perfect!
It’s not about fast driving, it’s about reliable driving with no stress! 
Just change on time oil, put gas, wash and this car will be still on road even with your grandkids."
929,10 months ago,5,"This car works amazing well, it stays good for years. You’ll of course have to take it for maintenance but that’s how every car is!"
930, 10 months ago,5,It is a nice car but too small for my family but it is one I would get if I didn't have kids very nice and good features
931, 10 months ago,5,I love my minivan it is roomy and has alot of cargo space and has nice features definitely one my favorite cars we have owned
932, 10 months ago,3,I only drive it a couple times a week its my brother in laws . it gets me to where I need to go. It feels like every other car I have driven nothing special. Its good on gas.
933, 10 months ago,1,I don’t recommend. It’s not as good as it looks. Hm not comfortable while you’re driving
934, 10 months ago,4,Toyota Camry is a nice roomy sedan. Perfect family car with plenty of room. Has good floor space and head space overall great cars to own.
935, 10 months ago,5,I had a 1994 Corolla. It was a great little car. Great on gas. Great mileage. Easy to keep clean with how compact it is.
936, 10 months ago,5,"My parents both own this car. Both vehicles have over 190,000 miles and the run very well. The body has aged very well with few dents and scratches. We have never required any major repairs so the maintenance remains low. If you pick this car and take care of it you won't be dissappointed."
937,10 months ago,4,I've owned a 2009 model. I've liked the car as it was spacious and had a smooth ride. There isn't much cabin noise when on the road.
938,10 months ago,4,"The 2004 Toyota Corolla was a newly redesigned model at that year. It came with a more sporty look.  It came in manual and automatic transmission. Even though it was made to be a ""sports"" car, it really didn't drive like a sports car and the body wasn't sturdy feeling. I was always told , by opinion, that if the car was ever to be in an accident that it would be smashed and totaled.   With that being said, the car is still reliable,  if you take care of it. It can last a really long time, and the seats are very comfortable."
939, 10 months ago,5,"This is a great car.  My mom has it and it’s lasted. It still looks good after many years, although it was kept in the garage and driven less than 5k a year.   She had only one problem."
940, 10 months ago,5,Old reliable! My Sienna is now 16-1/2 years old with over 200K miles on it. We've only replaced a few minor things and this car has stood the test of time and beating of 3 boys in various sports. Love my Cici
941, 10 months ago,5,We used to own a Camry and it was awesome! We felt very safe with this car and it never gave us any problems ! We have since given this car to my niece@for her to have for her first car ! Great car for that !
942, 10 months ago,5,"I LOVED MY CAMRY!!!! I had a 2001 Toyota Camry that I got handed down to me from my great grandma when I got my driver’s license. SUCH A GREAT CAR! My great grandma bought the car originally so she could “punch it!”, and I can verify it’s a very fast car (with a V6 if I remember correctly.) I could kick butt in races down State Street against boys with fancy cars on a Friday night. I 1000% would recommend that car. I drove it from 2016-2021 before finding out that it had a few pretty expensive fixes that need repair."
943, 10 months ago,5,"This is my first car. It runs well. We have had it in our family for maybe 6 years or longer. It was bought used. We put a lot of work into it, every year. It really is the best first car. Toyota has been known for its credible products throughout the years."
944, 10 months ago,4,"Driving this car was nice. It’s a very basic car, but it gets you from point a to point b with no issues at all. Toyota’s last forever too!"
945, 10 months ago,5,"In its 2020 edition, the 35-year-old combines that off-road capability with new features that give it higher standards of safety and technology. What I love about this truck is that on the outside it does not have many changes, which is FABULOUS !!! However, on the inside it has heated and ventilated seats and a new panel, designed to receive an 8.0-inch touchscreen, which is great, I honestly, OMG I love it! I would choose it over and over again! Toyota 4Runner"
946, 10 months ago,5,"I love the 2018 Corolla, it's a good car, very compact. I love its spacious cabin, it's packed with easy-to-use tech features. The Corolla is also well-equipped with advanced safety features, such as forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. Those familiar with the Corolla won't be surprised by its high predicted reliability rating or impressive fuel economy estimates. So it's perfect !!!! Toyota Corolla"
947, 10 months ago,3,"Not to good. I have sat in a better car before tbh.
I like the silver colour of the car. But there is something I do not like. The seats are kinda harder than the other cars I have sat in. I have been on many road trips had  afun time but just sitting in this car for a hour made my bum sore lmao. 
So I wouldn't recommend if you go on long car rides."
948, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Rav 4! It's super spacious and runs like a charm! Toyota seems to be a great brand in general but I really like the size of the Rav, it's not too small and also not to big! Also it's very affordable..I would definitely recommend this vehicle!"
949, 10 months ago,4,It’s my boyfriends and he’s had it as a hand-me-down for almost 10 years. There’s a lot of life left too

951, 10 months ago,4,"The stylish older sister to the Toyota Corolla. Feels like it is a little more luxury and has a bit more space. A little boring to look at in comparison to some other brands, but exciting for a Toyota. Easy to find parts, requires little maintenance, and it’s relatively affordable."
952, 10 months ago,5,"I live this brand of car, although I have had a lot of issues with the suspension system, but I did buy the car from a used car dealer."
953, 10 months ago,5,Excellent.  Nice styling  great gas mileage. The seats are pretty comfortable.  We rent them quite often.   It might be my next car.
954, 10 months ago,5,"Toyota Camry is one of the most reliable car I ever drive,very confident and gas saver,very good as everyday transportation"
955,10 months ago,4,The blindspots are the worse but other then that easy to drive. This is my dads car and he loves it
956,10 months ago,5,I love my car! Great with mileage and very reliable. Also the buying process was quick and easy. ￼
957, 10 months ago,5,Love it!  Perfect for for our family.  Great in snow and long road trips!  We’ve had our van for 6 years and our Prius for 2 and they are both great vehicles!
958, 10 months ago,5,"LOS AMOOOOO! En verdad desde hace unos años que encontré este coche me encanta es muy cómodo, tiene un diseño muy padre además que es perfecto para manejar en la ciudad!"
959, 10 months ago,4,Very good all terrain vehicle especially in the snow.  However the ride was a little bumpy it wasn't as smooth as I thought it would be
960,10 months ago,5,"I own the Toyota 4 Runner Limited Edition, love this vehicle. Once maintained properly this vehicle will last for years and still look good. Parts and labor are fairly priced as well so that’s something. I will always own a Toyota 4 Runner... best vehicle."
961, 10 months ago,5,From driving a big truck for years i must admit this is a big change for me but omg i have no regrets!! Very roomy Super cheap in gas and i can park anywhere haha unlike driving a big truck savings for me on gas ... i love my scion
962,10 months ago,3,One of my girlfriends has the Toyota Rab for and it could not be more cute. It is a very good and mileage and the sun and moon roof make everything on the car. It has a good radio system as well. I always enjoy going on road trips with her.￼￼
963, 10 months ago,5,I have been in love with tayotas my first car was a 2001 tayota camry I loved it but then I got another tayota camry hybrid and I kinda like it but I miss my 2001 I dont like that my car haves leather seats and it gets so hot in the coachella valley for me and my 20 month old baby but its what I can afford since I'm still paying it off.
964, 10 months ago,5,"Love my 4runner! It has lots of space in the trunk, heated leather seats, sunroof, & more. I think it looks really good, too! I feel safe while driving it, which is most important."
965, a year ago,5,"My husband has a Toyota Prius 2012! Still looks great, runs great, and we save a lot  of gas money when we travel , more fun !"
966, a year ago,3,I have never owned a Toyota Camry but I’ve sat in one multiple times. It seems like a reliable and affordable car. It is roomy enough for a compact car.
967, a year ago,3,This car is a bit on the smaller side for me. It would be a good first car for beginners to practice. Economical choice.
968, a year ago,5,"I have a 2020 Toyota four runner and I absolutely love it. It is the perfect fit for me,  being 4WD and having plenty of space without the bulkiness of other SUVs in its class. Gas mileage isn’t the best, but now a days, most trucks and SUVs don’t get the best anyways. I highly recommend to any family that needs extra space but wants the off road, 4WD, and smaller size SUV."
969, a year ago,5,"This is the perfect car for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. It has the room she needs while in college and the amazing gas mileage she needs coming back and forth between home and school. The safety scores of the RAV 4 was a HUGE deciding factor in our decision to purchase this car for our daughter. She loves it so much that when the time comes for her to make her our purchase, she plans on buying another one."
970,a year ago,5,My husband loves his car. It's excellent on had miles. We have no issues with it.  So far we haven't had to replace any parts but when looking up replacement parts it wasn't crazy pricey. We love our reliable car. Also it's spacious.
971,a year ago,5,Before I had my Tacoma I owned a 2014 Camry. I loved that car. It was fun to drive and spunky. The get up and go getting on the freeway was impressive! I love the Toyota lineup of vehicles.
972,a year ago,5,I got to drive a Rav 4 when my Tacoma was on the shop for a recall. It was a fun/sporty vehicle to drive. I actually didn’t want to take it back. If I didn’t have a need for a truck I would own one in a heartbeat
973, a year ago,5,My Toyota Prius is great on gas and does not cost a lot to repair when needed. Great features and amazing safety features.
974, a year ago,5,Best hybrid car my 2nd hybrid car 2005 and now 2011 best gas mileage awesome will get new models soon
975, a year ago,5,vet scrunched up cat to drive but was fun to drive and it got great gas milage . I would recommend it to anyone
976, a year ago,5,"My sister bought this car used. It got great gas mileage, solid car. It didn’t sound ""tinny"" when I drove it.

The airbags are literally a lifesaver.  My sister was driving this car with her son & their dog when they were hit by a semi-trailer truck. Yes, an 18 wheeler! 

To the shock of the first responders & ER staff everyone survived. Impressive!"
977, a year ago,5,I borrowed a newer one of these recently and loved it. I was impressed by the updates that had been made since the older models that I use to drive for work. I felt safe inside the solid frame and heavy doors. It really had a lot of acceleration power getting on the freeway which was fantastic! It is also very comfortable to ride in and great for long trips. 👌
978, a year ago,5,"I have this car for 5 years and never had any problems with it ,it’s 2012 Camry le and I’m still enjoying it"
979, a year ago,4,It seems like it works well. There is a lot of space in the trunk of the car which is amazing.
980,a year ago,4,Great cars in my opinion a bit pricey for repairs and parts but overall a great car good gas mileage nice look
981, a year ago,5,Great suv very safe and comfortable. Great body style. My mom loves her RAV4 she has only owned Toyota’s
982, a year ago,4,This is the car I usually pick for a rental. It has good gas mileage and the interior is roomy. I prefer a car that is higher up for everyday use because I am a nervous driver.
983, a year ago,5,I don’t have one yet but this is the car I want in the near future .i have read all the reviews and even test drove one so fingers crossed .it has a great price !!!
984, a year ago,5,Well I only have this car so it’s good enough to go to places and have long road trips as well.
985, a year ago,3,2019 Toyota Camry was reliable and very safe. Limited special features but great fuel economy.
986,a year ago,4,"The Toyota Corolla is a well made, affordable Japanese car. After the Honda Accord, this is my second favourite car. The parts are inexpensive and easy to source and they often last forever."
987, a year ago,4,"Never has given any mechanical problems. Comfortable and spacious, but not too big. Can be pricey, but worth it."
988, a year ago,5,I love this van. It is so convenient now that I have 3 kids and two are in car seats. Toyota never lets you down. The van is so roomy and the back has plenty of room for a double  stroller plus more without having to lay a seat down. But you do have that option for even more storage room. Tons of cup holders which is a must.
989, a year ago,5,This is what my oldest daughter drives. It gets great gas mileage and is so small you can park almost anywhere. It drives good too. The only down side is it has very little room.
990, a year ago,5,"Great for everyday activities!  Big enough to haul all my kids and purchases, but small enough to fit into most compact parking spaces: and all while looking fantastic."
991, a year ago,5,I love my car! Never given me any trouble in the 4 years I’ve had it. Perfect car for me
992, a year ago,5,I owned a Camry for many years and one of my best friends has one and neither of us have a complaint.
993, a year ago,5,"At 140,000 miles and going strong, this is is best vehicle I have ever driven. Our 4WD version with standard armor plating underneath the entire vehicle, I can assure you mine has brave countless situations with intelligent power. Our lives and itself have been saved by the DAC traction control going down steep grades in icy snow, not to mention summer jaunts up 45 degree slopes. Classy, tough and sexy all at the same time."
994, a year ago,5,"Great reliable car, and has good mileage. I feel safe driving this car. It is very compact and easy to park"
995, a year ago,3,"Low maintenance and easy to use no extra cost for anything, smooth drive and less gas"
996, a year ago,5,It’s great! Very spacious and yet it’s very sleek and makes everyone in the car very comfortable! Runs very smooth and looks amazing!
997, a year ago,5,A very fancy looking car! It’s very spacious for both sorbet and passengers. It has a classy look to it and runs very smooth.
998, a year ago,5,Love it! Small yet spacious on the inside! Great MPGs given! I feel safe and cool in the car!
999, a year ago,5,I rented a Toyota Corolla recently it drives pretty nice and smooth. It got excellent gas mileage I would definitely own one of these.
1000, a year ago,5,I have a 2012 Toyota Camry and I absolutely love it. It drives very smooth. I love the fact that I have other seats and it gets really good gas mileage. It has a roomy interior and very comfortable seats. If I would have to say anything negative it would be the keys wore out and I had to get them replaced
1001, a year ago,2,A little tight in the back seat. I hate the feature that beeps as another care gets too close or your lanes. So annoying.
1002, a year ago,5,"I used to own a Silver 2010 Toyota Corolla. My Toyota Corolla was a great car. I really miss that car. Easy to drive, no blind spots, great stereo. Best of all, I would have to say was the gas millage. Absolutely great gas millage considering it was just a regular automatic with great get up and go. Would I ever buy another one??? YES!!!!!"
1003,a year ago,4,The turning that thing can do is slap amazing! I don't like that it's so small. There's no leg room at all in the 3rd row and if someone is in the 3rd row you have no extra space in the back for bags or anything. I hate that if you don't get the gas above half it runs rather rough. The only good thing I like is it can turn a complete circle at drop of dime.
1004, a year ago,3,"This is the car I presently own.  I’ve had it for years now.   I’m currently looking for a new car.  Every single time I get in my car I hit my head. It’s not like I have a big head, it’s just that maybe that year they didn’t do something right.   My family members happen to agree with me.   Overall I guess it’s not a bad car."
1005, a year ago,5,I love my Camry it’s a great and durable car for anyone young or old. It will get you where you need to go no questions asked it’s great on gas and such great quality! Mine is an older version but still runs like a champ
1006, a year ago,5,Loved my Camry and all the features and technology that Toyota uses. Probably my favorite vehicle to date.
1007, a year ago,3,It’s s nice car but I prefer the land cruiser.   If I were to purchase a new car it would be a Mercedes 🤓
1008, a year ago,5,"I love my car , super good car and you can fit everybody seven seats super good and a good price range"
1009, a year ago,5,The Toyota camera is an excellent car. It gets great gas mileage and has good room for the family.
1010, a year ago,5,I love my car! Even though it is an older model it still has everything I need in it. Super easy to service and maintain
1011, a year ago,5,"I bought a Toyota Camry back in 2011. I loved that car! It was dependable, gas saving, and safe. My daughter had a bad wreck in it back in 2013, and because of its safety features, she came out of that accident without a scratch. I would recommend this as a first car for both young and older drivers."
1012, a year ago,5,Very economical car comfortable is medium tires are suitable for trips perfect for maintenance they do car wash free and oil change
1013, a year ago,4,"Vehículo comodo y amplio ideal para todo tipo, trocha, afalto, arena, entre otros. El valor es un poco alto pero la calidad y el dieño vale la pena."
1014,a year ago,5,I was sad to find out they don’t make this anymore. I have an 11 (almost12) year old Matrix and is still in good shape. I love everything about it. It’s the perfect size for me and economical.
1015, a year ago,5,Camry is the go to brand for dependability. Requires just routine maintenance and this car will last a life time
1016,a year ago,5,Very good excelent amplio agradable espacioso juvenil para toda la familia comodo y con muchas ventajas buen sistema hidraulico maniobra genial aros originales asientos comodos y un sistema de aire

1018, a year ago,5,I’m obsessed with this car. My fiancé and I now both own one and think they’re fun to drive and look great too. They’re not the fastest sporty car you’ll ever drive but the quality from Toyota is unmatched.
1019, a year ago,5,I have the 2005 toyota camry and I love it. It's a reliable car. Drives smooth. It's definitely a keeper. Great on gas. Very spacey.
1020, a year ago,5,"Love this car. Almost a tie with the Prius! Excellent gas mileage, still has enough space for passengers and/or car seats, looks nice, reliable & pretty safe"

1023, a year ago,5,"Good car, drove it at work, reliable & safe. No problems, decent gas mileage. Not my style but overall a really really good car"
1024, a year ago,5,"I liked it a lot, basically is a corolla with a hatchback. Good size, more storage than a fit without being a Prius. Good little car, solid & safe"
1025, a year ago,5,"I had to drive a Camry when my car was getting fix from a deer accident.  My car is a Chevy Suburban so going to a large car to a medium sized Sudan was a challenge. I actually felt it had lots of leg room, drove well even in deep snow and had a very spacious trunk."
1026, a year ago,5,Love the Prius cars. Personally I like the Prius C & Prius V the best because they have a better rear-view than the ones with the split back windows. Gas mileage is pretty awesome & I find I'm willing to go more places and plan more things since I'm not as worried about the cost of driving or gas
1027, a year ago,5,I own a 2008 Toyota scion xb . It's a small coupe driver great  Toyota Scion  runs great on gas drives fast too can't complain sporty car .. mines blue
1028, a year ago,5,Toyota's are by far the best cars on the market. My Camry is a 2004 with over 275k miles on her with no major repairs. Still in perfect working order! Nothing really to complain about. Affordable? Absolutely. My family won't ever own any other kind of car!
1029, a year ago,5,"Love it, this is my first new car and it's been a dream to drive. My gas mileage is great! I made sure to get a model with a moonroof."

1033,a year ago,5,"Been having my baby going on 6 years now and it still purrs like a dream! I have not had any major issues and only had to do the normal upkeep (oil change, new tires, brakes). Durable. Dependable and I would recommend the brand."
1034, a year ago,5,Best car for traveling! It’s small but still feels spacious! It only takes about $30 to fill up your tank which is great when you drive everyday to commute to work or to go on a road trip!
1035,a year ago,4,"I drove the RAV4 8 years ago so it’s been awhile. I’m technically rating a whole different car but alright, I really liked it! Loved the interior and steering. Drove it on long trips too and from college and it was quite comfortable to be in. Was able to fit all of my college stuff in it. Knocked a star off because it wasn’t super fancy technically inside."
1036, a year ago,5,"As my first car, this is a perfectly sized car with exactly what you expect of a SUV. Easy to drive and maneuver, and the pricing for it is decent too. Definitely affordable; comes in 3 package tiers (LE, XLE, and limited being the highest). Overall, I would recommend this car 👍."
1037, a year ago,5,"Great car. Roomy. Feels luxury. I love “welcome to Camry” when it turns on. Great value retention. No complaints whatsoever. Camry is a big dog car, for smart people."
1038, a year ago,5,I drive a 2009 Toyota Matrix Hatchback. I love it. It gets wonderful gas mileage. I can get about 200 miles to a tank.
1039, a year ago,5,"Súper confortable, me encanta es súper económica en cuestión de gasolina, llevo tres años con ella y hasta ahora ningún problema"
1040, a year ago,4,"We bought this in 2005.  It was because we needed a bigger vehicle for kids.  We enjoys it for camping and exploring nature as well as day to day use, but it is getting older and needing more maintenance. "
1041, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my Toyota Camry. I have the 2019 Hybrid. It is incredible on fuel economy, which was most important to me when purchasing a car. The exterior looks like a sporty car, and it has the option to drive like a sports car or has more leisurely options. Love the tech on the inside."
1042,a year ago,4,This is a great motor vehicle . I love the leather interior and the affordability of putting in petrol .
1043, a year ago,5,"Spacious, seems safe. Back seat is small and only comfortable for small people. Nice that the seats fold down."
1044, a year ago,4,"I loved the Toyota Prius, it’s great on gas and fits a lot more than you would expect. However, it’s a light weight car and because of this driving on the highway is a little anxiety inducing."
1045, a year ago,4,They like the most popular but im. Or that into it I will need definitely more space
1046, a year ago,5,"I love, love, love my Toyota Highlander!!! It is the nicest car I have ever owned. It drives so nice and has so many safety features. I think it should have a little more room behind the back seat. It is a little pricey, but well worth the money because it should last me a really long time."
1047, a year ago,4,"Great car! Drove around for awhile! I love Toyota... I wish they Sold a Toyota Camry (SUV EDITION) I would totally trade my Lexus in and get it. 

I love Camrys, they are just small cars. The Engine is great too"
1048, a year ago,5,"I use and abuse my vehicles, as I travel for work. I probably travel 10 times as many miles as the average person per year. My Toyota Corolla has over 250,000 miles, and it still running strong despite very little maintenance. When I do need work on it, anyone is able to work on it, and the parts are easy to find. Gas mileage is awesome!￼ A very affordable vehicle as well. My only complaint is that space is a little tight. I would tell anyone to buy a Toyota Corolla.￼"
1049, a year ago,5,"Me encanta, super comodo y con gran capacidad de personas simplemente uno de lps mejores autos que te vas a encontrar."
1050, a year ago,5,I really like Toyota Camrys and would recommend them over Honda any day! They are reliable and get very good mileage! One thing about a Camry is that it is going to last you forever as long as you take care of it! Toyota Camry
1051, a year ago,5,Really nice car from inside to the outside. The sound system was great and the seats were super comfortable. Passenger seat was smooth on the ride

1054, a year ago,5,Is a very good car the every time i ride my sister she surpise about the amount of space do i have it not a expensive car and its not expensive to get a full tank every time you go to the gas station and i love it and if you are a girl tinking to buy a good car this is it
1055, a year ago,5,Great on gas! Drives smooth and is comfortable. I love driving my car 🚗 every day.  Besides regular oil changes and required maintenance I have not had any issues. This was a great buy!
1056, a year ago,5,Best car I have ever had was a 99’ toyota Corolla LE. Had great zip for such a little engine. I regret selling it for a bigger car. Never had any major issues with it. Just did the regular maintenance stuffs.
1057, a year ago,5,Reliable. The take off isn’t as good as I expected for a 6 cylinder car. But I really like Toyotas. Only thing I notice is the plastic interior stuffs don’t last as long as the engine. And if you live where it gets really hot and really cold in winter I’m sure that dorado help the lifespan of it.
1058, a year ago,5,"My 2011 Toyota RAV4 is the best car. It’s taken my everywhere and hasn’t had any issues (minus the minor tune-ups needed). It has almost 200k miles on it and I’ve been driving it for the past 6 years (and someone had it for 4 years previous). It has a good amount of space for transportation, nice features, and I’ll always stand by this car."
1059, a year ago,4,Great car! Not the safest on the road but it is an SUV. Good tech features. There is a good amount of space in the hatch. It could use more space for passengers though. Fun to drive.
1060, a year ago,3,Great if you don't have a family to tote around. It gets you where you need to go but there is no room in the back. Its a cute little car to zip around in but I didnt find it very comfortable. I didn't trust on taking it on big trips either but I didnt have any big issues with it.
1061, a year ago,5,Smooth interior and smooth riding. Controls are easy to handle and it has an interface that lets you know your tire pressure and oil levels. Also gives you a reminder for oil changes. Very great quality seats and steering is wonderful. Been on many trips and one and its always an easy ride.
1062, a year ago,5,Ligero bueno y espacioso. Maneje el carro de una amiga por un tiempo y la verdad es que me gusto ese auto pero me quedo con mi Chevrolet

1064, a year ago,5,I love this car! My mom had 2 of them and I loved borrowing them. Super nice and fun to drive.
1065, a year ago,5,"Honestly I love my car a ton. So much space. I feel like I’m better protected in a higher sitting vehicle than a small car. Has a tow hitch, and large trunk with convertible seats. It does take a bit more gas due to being a v8 but honesty worth it."
1066, a year ago,5,"Perfect adventuring vehicle! You can fit a family or lay down the back seats and fit your dogs. You don’t have to have the off road addition to go on trails, the RAV4 handles tough terrain like a dream!"
1067, a year ago,5,Perfect single person or small family vehicle. Spacious trunk that can easily fit a stroller or wheelchair. It’s small size makes it easy to maneuver in traffic and tight spaces.
1068, a year ago,5,"My first car! And i love since day one, it has been with me for almost 8 years, without a problem. Easy to maintain and cheap in gas."
1069, a year ago,5,"The 4Runner is a great vehicle, I have really enjoyed being a passenger in it. It is nice to sit a little higher than other vehicles, the seats are very comfy and the cargo space is incredible. I live in utah so this is a great car for all of my family adventures. I would highly recommend it. "
1070,a year ago,5,Toyotas are great cars the gas mileage on the RAV4 is impeccable. This is my daughters car I feel it is safe and reliable for her as a 17-year-old driver.
1071, a year ago,5,My Toyota was perfect never had any mechanical issues. Omg this is a go to car for reliability and not a lot of maintenance. Highly recommend Toyota to all my friends.
1072, a year ago,4,It runs great! I like my car a lot. It needs some minor adjustments but overall a great car.
1073, a year ago,5,"Great car!  Reliable, great gas mileage.  Retain their value.  Rarely break and if they do inexoyto fix."

1076, a year ago,4,es un auto bastante cómodolos asientos de su interior son bastante amplios para pasajeros te llevo muy bien a todos lados tiene buen motor el detalle que no me gustó es que la cajuela es muy reducida caben muy pocas cosas
1077, a year ago,5,"What’s not to love about a Corolla. Great gas milage, easy to handle and last forever."
1078, a year ago,4,"I’ve only been a passenger, I love the look on the exterior of this SUV, and the interior is also very pleasing. The ride feels smooth and comfortable. My only complaint is the sound quality on the speakers!"
1079, a year ago,5,"Good steady car. It’s lasted us over 10 years without repairs needed or decreasing gas mileage. I highly recommend this car. Spacious, smooth to drive, and worth the cost."
1080,a year ago,5,"I love my Highlander! It's spacious, comfortable, smooth driving, great on gas for an SUV, and simply beautiful. I received so many compliments when others ride in my vehicle. I love all the features and it's highly rated for safety!"
1081, a year ago,5,I haven’t owned one of these but I have been a passenger in one and it drives smooth and also has good gas mileage. I’m not sure how much it costs to fix but maybe it’s not that bad. I would recommend it’!
1082,a year ago,5,"I love my Rav4! It’s my second, my original was the 2018 model and I just upgraded to the 2021 model. It’s sleek and comes with all the amenities you could ask for!"
1083,a year ago,3,"I wanted to love the RAV4 but was disappointed in the power. It felt like it was struggling to get up to speed and to maintain. 

Unfortunately all of the RAV4s have the same engine too which is disappointing with No option to upgrade. I would much rather get a little less gas mileage and get more horse power to make it feel adequate."
1084,a year ago,4,"I like the Toyota 4 Runner but, I wish it was more of a luxury pickup truck. I know pickups aren’t supposed to be fancy but, I think they should have digital dials & or switches & not turn knobs. It rides nice. The backup camera is decent. We had the Rocky Ridge Edition added onto our pickup truck & we love it lifted."
1085,a year ago,4,My family all have Rav4s of different years/colors. We usually buy the basic package or a tier above. We live in New England and prefer Rav4s for their 4 wheel drive. Overall I feel that Toyota Rav4s are a safe choice as they are durable and grear for the winter. Im not sure if thr highest tier has this but the lower tiers do not come with seat warmers which I wished they would.

1091, a year ago,5,"Amazing car, drives great, most comfortable car I’ve ever driven, runs amazing and has a good bit of power behind it too"
1092, a year ago,4,It’s a great car it doesn’t have enough room in the car it gets good gas mileage it’s just to. Small if it had room it would be great
1093, a year ago,5,Es pequeño pero maravilloso. Sus asientos súper cómodos y los colores muy vivos. Ideal para familias pequeñas.
1094,a year ago,5,"This has the best air conditioning and roomiest interior compared to all the other brands we test drove. Super smooth ride, comfy seats, fits everything and everyone. We test drove in FL in August while I was 7 months pregnant so I can attest to the a/c claim."
1095,a year ago,5,I owned a Toyota Scion a few years back and loved it! It was a car that got me through a lot of changes and withstood the test of time. Even after it got high milage I rarely needed to do maintenance. I would have kept this car if someone had not hit me and totaled it.
1096, a year ago,5,This was the family car growing up and it got us from a-b without any trouble. It is still going strong to this day!
1097, a year ago,5,I love the 4Runners! They are relatable and durable and look great whether you are off road or on. Big enough to travel but not so big that it’s a gas guzzler. Great for camping and taking off road adventures.
1098, a year ago,4,Toyota’s are great care and a reliable brand. This is a starter car or basic car for the price. I would see me getting this for my daughter as a first car or if your someone looking for a good economical choice.
1099, a year ago,5,Great dependable car that is economical for its class while having a high rate reliability and durability. Good midsize car for the price.
1100, a year ago,5,"Perfect size for someone getting used to driving, cool new features like the back up camera make things easier too."
1101, a year ago,4,"I drove two Toyota Camrys prior to purchasing my first car (as my parents gifted me their used models). I loved my cars!

1102, a year ago,5,I love the sleek sophisticated look.This is a pretty decent vehicle and gives great mileage. Comfortable enough for long distance and every day use equally.Easy to take care of and easy to park.

1104, a year ago,3,Its a great family van or rafter can.whichever. its loaded and comfy. You could take a long trip with your family and they not complain too much. My best friend owns one and I really like hers. 
1105, a year ago,3,"Toyota makes good cars simple. Yotas live forever. Tons of people in small mountain areas either have a Toyota or a Subaru. This car was a good family car. I mean, personally I can't have a small car, but I didn't mind riding in this car. "
1106,a year ago,4,"I enjoyed owning a Matrix. At the time, I didn’t want a standard size vehicle or van and this was right in-between. It was comfortable, had decent mileage and looked different than other cars at the time."
1107,a year ago,5,Safest car out there. I felt secure driving my infant/toddler around. I knew it was a car I could depend on. Gas was good. It delivered on space especially when u have a family.
1108,a year ago,4,"Safe car. Great for a first time car. Spacious and drives smoothly. Nicely and fully equipped, even the base model is sufficient."
1109, a year ago,3,"The seats are a bit too firm and oddly feel angled in a bad way, but it is a decent and affordable car with good mileage and convenient features like a temperature display and lighted vanity mirrors."
1110, a year ago,2,"It's sleek but boxy. The interior has a very cramped feeling, everything seems too big and too close so there's no getting comfortable or being able to relax."
1111, a year ago,5,"This was one of the cars I had throughout college. Did not put a lot of money into the care besides brakes/struts. I ended up selling it when it hit 200,000 miles to a family member. They always tell that it’s still running great and haven’t had to do major repairs on it still."
1112, a year ago,4,I like the Toyota Corolla. It drives nicely and performs well. Speed is good and the features are nice

1115, a year ago,4,10/10 for the Toyota but not 5/5 stars because it’s nice but would expect more for the inside! More comfortable and spacious
1116, a year ago,5,Toyota is such an amazing car! I never have problems with my car! My family always was a Toyota type and looks like it’s not going anywhere!
1117, a year ago,4,"These are perfect for those who love the feel of a SUV, but are not interested in a big SUV nor want something to small. Also has great features like 4x4. Which works great when you live in an area that snows. The newer the year of the car the better. I had a 2012 and it has served me well. Always considering getting the newer model."
1118, a year ago,5,I have a 2010 and I love it. My first car. It’s very dependable and has lasted all these years.
1119, a year ago,4,"Es un coche resistente, que además en lo personal tiene asientos cómodos, es fácil de manejar a pesar de que es un coche algo grande, algo que me llamo la atención al menos del corolla que conocí es que tenía un agarre especial para las sillas de los pequeños, cosa que muchos no tienen."
1120, a year ago,5,"I have a brand new Toyota Corolla and it is great! Such an affordable price with a lot of luxury aspects such as two tone leather, heated seats, remote start, iPhone technology, and so much more! I would recommend this vehicle."
1121, a year ago,5,"To be a compact car, this vehicle has a lot of space. At first I was not so keen on how small it is, but once I realized that the back seats fold down and there is a ton of room, I was all in."
1122, a year ago,5,Es in buen automobile. Los recomiendo mucho. En la parte de adentro  del movil  todo es Bonito. Apart Toyota es una compania  que vende carros de Buena calidad.

1125, a year ago,5,"Toyotas are awesome.￼ I have owned several and all of them have been wonderful.￼ Toyotas are low maintenance and run for many many years with no problems. This is one of the best cars I’ve ever had. Camry is a nice size car, It is midsize and comfortably fits five people.￼￼ If you are looking for a good long lasting, long running, easy maintenance car I would highly recommend a Toyota, and I Camry is a good choice."
1126, a year ago,5,"I drive a 2017 Toyota Corolla SE, have had this car for about 6 months now and I love it. It has plenty of room and great on gas which makes this car perfect for my love of traveling."

1128, a year ago,3,The interior deteriorates fairly quick. Fits about 8 people very common for people with kids to want these because of the space. Pretty practical
1129, a year ago,3,Although it has improved the Corolla is pretty slow. It is gas efficient and proficient for daily activity. Accommodate for four people.

1131, a year ago,5,Love the Toyota rav 4. My husband and I have both owned one. Super dependable and good gas mileage.
1132, a year ago,5,I had a Toyota Camry as my first car in High school and College and I loved it! This car lasted me a long while and I was able to pay it off. I made it to over 230k before experiencing any problems. It outlasted my friends newer cars so I have all good things to say about Toyota Camrys. It's also a great family car. 
1133, a year ago,5,Love the Toyota 4 runner. I have drove this before but was a 1998 model which I loved. Would to own a newer style but not enough room for family of 5.
1134, a year ago,5,"Perfect suv for a big family.
Very dependable, has a great mpg.
The 4wheel drive comes in very handy during less fortunate situations or during icy, snowy days.
I drive mine on a daily basis, as long as you keep it up to date on engine and tires as you should this vehicle can keep going past 200,000 miles or more without issue."
1135, a year ago,5,"Toyota is the car for me. We had a Camry for years and drove it until we couldnt anymore. This car was so nice, stylish, and easy to maintain ."

1140, a year ago,5,"My car is very reliable. I've owned it since 2012. It is a 2007 toyota 4 runner. I love my car! Its exactly what I need, from carrying grandbabies to hauling some home improvement products! She is almost at the 200,000 mark and still going!"
1141, a year ago,4,It is a nice car. It has a good looking design.  My friend loves it. It consumes less gass than other ones on the market.
1142, a year ago,5,"Absolutely LOVED our Yaris. We got the hybrid and it was just amazing. Super nippy, easy to drive. Parking sensors and camera which was absolutely ideal for myself that can't park. Got it as part of a motability scheme so cannot comment on cost but honestly would recommend to anyone."
1143, a year ago,5,Love it it’s so  smooth it sounds good smells good feels good one of the best in its class
1144, a year ago,5,"I love my baby. This car is the best car in the world. Compact, great gas mileage and best of all, it NEVER breaks down"

1150, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love the new RAV4. My sister bought the fully load one and I fell in love and want one!! Very spacious, seat warmers are amazing, prefect for moms and a lot of room for cargo. All around great hope to be able to get one soon. ￼"

1152, a year ago,3,"My best friend in high school drove a Prius, and I would sometimes drive her car. It was not my favorite car but it has it advantages. It has an okay drive but the gas milage that the Prius has is superior to so many other sedans"
1153, a year ago,4,One of my close friends in high school drive a Toyota Highlander- it was an older model so I’m not sure how this compares to today’s models but I learned to back in park in this car. It was very simple to drive and was a smooth ride.

1155, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota RAV4 so much it was the best decision ever when deciding on what type of suv I wanted. So spacious and comfortable.
1156, a year ago,4,"I’ve owned my 2010 toyota corolla for 8 years, and got it used. It was my first car at 16, and is a very safe car. Great for new drivers. Brakes are very touchy, but this is a great, long-lasting car. I would have to recommend!"
1157, a year ago,5,Very reliable car at a great price! Drives smooth and breaks well. This car has a lot of space in the car and in the trunk too. The features on the car makes the driving experience easy and enjoyable.
1158, a year ago,5,My very first car was a Toyota Corolla. It was handed down throughout my family to drive when I was done with it bc it lasted so long despite having many miles on it. These cars are definitely meant to last!
1159, a year ago,4,A pretty solid car for anyone who is looking to buy their first car. I feel like the Corolla is a classic and reliable!
1160, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my Corolla.  I have a 2007 Corolla, with 350,000 miles on it.  I am the original owner and have just to replace an alienator.  Other than routine maintenance that was my first repair.  Absolutely LOVE!"

1162, a year ago,5,"Well I had a 2001 Toyota Corolla before and let me tell you, that was one of my favorite cars it was affordable on gas and would last pretty long before going back to E. It was perfect in the snow I’ve never got stuck or had to leave it behind. One thing I would say is that there was not much space in there but overall a great car."
1163, a year ago,3,"My 16th birthday car was a 2007 black scion Tc. I was so excited it was a hatchback and just a sexy car for highschool. I loved driving that car. It didn't have much headroom if you were tall. It's a perfect car for someone who doesn't live where it snows. Coming from Montana, where it snowed alot. Let's say I got stuck alot."

1172, a year ago,5,"I have owned two of them, and I don’t think I will ever switch to a different vehicle. It has everything that I need in a car even as a 2012. It looks sporty, yet still has a family feel."
1173, a year ago,5,Love it and it is comfortable. The seats are a little deep because I have short legs
1174, a year ago,5,My 1998 Toyota Camry has been the most reliable car I’ve owned. It’s made the journey not once but twice from BC to Ontario with one time having a little uhaul trailer. It works well for everyday commuting and it’s great on gas too
1175, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota Camry. It’s great on the miles and gas. I will definitely purchase another one.
1176, a year ago,5,Best vehicle I’ve ever had. I had a different color or previous to this one and I told her in a very bad accident and walked away without a scratch. The safety is impeccable￼
1177, a year ago,5,My boyfriend has this car in grey color. It’s good for his height he is 6”3 I’m 5”2 and it’s not comfortable to get in the car. He loves his car and doesn’t want to change it. The reason why I like it.  Because it’s very smooth and spacious

1179, a year ago,5,This is my Mom’s car. I am jealous of the fuel consumption but not of the size of the car.  It’s actually pretty cool to drive but I am used to SUV size vehicles.  I would love to get a hybrid SUV but it’s too expensive
1180, a year ago,4,"I have a 2019 model, bought in Dec 2018 For a SUV it is very fuel efficient. I hate the fact that the windows and locks are not visible at night on the doors , that’s why I took a star away. That should’ve been a standard feature not an add on per trim 💁🏽. It’s not the fastest suv but it gets me where I have to get to.  It’s loaded with features including backup camera blind spot monitor and more.  Some are more used than others.  Love my electronic seats😊Toyota RAV4"
1181,a year ago,5,Loved my Corolla. It was a fabulous car that had great gas mileage. I had the car for 5 years and there were zero issues. Would recommend this car to anyone looking for something long lasting and affordable
1182, a year ago,5,My spouse has this and it’s been great to have it’s very techy without the price it has a small screen for gps to avoid using ur phone and it’s touch screen
1183, a year ago,5,I love my car it drives great it’s smooth I’ve never had any major issues so far I’ve only had to do regular maintenance
1184, a year ago,3,I rate this car a 3 only because I could never see myself owning this type of vehicle model. For a little person like me it’s just too big and scary to drive. The inside itself though is very spacious and can fit a whole family which is amazing.
1185, a year ago,5,I have had my Toyota Camry for 4 1/2 years and never have I experienced a single problem with it. Toyota’s are such smooth cars that will last you forever if you keep up the maintenance on them. If I ever buy a new car it will only be because mine gave out on me.
1186, a year ago,5,"This car is wonderful. Very spacious and easy on the eyes. Every time I’ve rode in the car l, it has been a smooth ride. The inside of the car feels larger than it looks. Two people could sleep in it, with a lot of space, if need be."
1187, a year ago,3,Terrible in the snow. And in the rain. And pretty much anything that isn't a nice sunny day. Decent on gas though. 
1188, a year ago,5,Love my car. So much fun to drive. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun car. Great gas mileage. And love love love the camera. Makes backing up easy.

1190,a year ago,3,precioso mr encanto una vrz un uber lo tenía edta soñado sobre todo para las personas con familia es  más cómodo y rapido
1191,a year ago,5,Great car. Hit a deer and could still drive it. No airbag deployment no windshield damage just front end damage that was cosmetic. The safety features on this car is amazing. Do your regular maintenance and you won't be able to kill it.
1192,a year ago,5,Best car I have ever owned. I have owned alot of them but this car takes abuse and keeps running. I have a 2005 and I have had to replace very little for repairs. Do your regular scheduled maintenance and you cannot kill a Toyota. Both of my husbands have been mechanics and I have helped them wrench on cars. I will always buy a Toyota before any other brand for a good reason.
1193, a year ago,4,Very nice suv. Only thing I think could be better is if they were made a little wider. Other then that these are very nice good looking cars.
1194, a year ago,5,"One of the better cars I've driven. It's lasted over 300k miles and hasn't let me down yet, mechanically at least! Don't cheap out on a decent battery though, it'll go a long way and always change your oil when it's needed."
1195,a year ago,4,"It fits my family of 4 and gets us comfortably from point a to b as long as it’s not a long ride. If 4 people traveled together, would need 4 smaller carry ons. I drive 30 miles one way to work so this helps with lowering gas utility compared to the Tahoe I really want. I was going through oil like crazy after 100,000 miles and one filter change later, no problem. Back to new. Now that the kids are older I think my next car will be that Tahoe. This was great for my elementary and middle school aged kids"
1196, a year ago,5,My mom used to own one and I’d drive it everywhere. Rides great and it’s such a dependable vehicle
1197, a year ago,5,My family owns the newest version and it drives and rides like a dream. Great SUV!!
1198, a year ago,5,Love my car. Dependable and great on gas. I’ve had it for a few years and still no major issues
1199, a year ago,5,I totally love it. It’s really good and you can use it everyday. Totally recommend to everyone. Once you use it you will never go back. Also it’s very affordable and everyone can get it.
1200, a year ago,5,I totally love it. It’s really good and you can use it everyday. Totally recommend to everyone. Once you use it you will never go back. Also it’s very affordable and everyone can get it.
1201, a year ago,5,I totally love it. It’s really good and you can use it everyday. Totally recommend to everyone. Once you use it you will never go back. Also it’s very affordable and everyone can get it.
1202, a year ago,5,Very reliable. This vehicle is such a workhorse. I appreciate the AWD when we are driving in snow in a winter country.  It holds a lot and I’d definitely repurchase. 
1203, a year ago,4,Great vehicle! Cheap and economical for an SUV. It’s definitely on the lower end of SUVs but it’s a fun vehicle to zip around it. It’s still reliable and will get you to most places you want to go.  
1204, a year ago,5,Pretty reliable car. I’ve had it for like over a decade and it’s still running well.  The only complain I have is that it’s a pretty light vehicle so it doesn’t hold its own very well on highways 
1205, a year ago,4,Slow to accelerate. Definitely just a city car. Nothing too harsh since it's small. Gas mileage was pretty good. The car itself was comfortable.
1206, a year ago,4,"I like the car to drive it, it is spacious and I love that you save money on gas, but in my family there are 5 plus my dog ​​who is a German shepherd and the space he has for the back seats is very small, you can not stretch  Well your feet and although it is for 5 people you are not very comfortable, and finally it does not have any type of light for the back seats or in the trunk and if you are looking for something at night or taking your purchases from the supermarket you have to use one  flashlight or your cell phone to be able to see, it is definitely not a comfortable car for a family of 5, but it would be the ideal car for a family of 3 or someone single."
1207, a year ago,4,"Recently drove the car for a bit while my personal ride was down. Pretty smooth drive, like the added tech of it (the model had a really good sensor and camera system) pretty impressive. Not a fan necessarily of the size of the trunk but overall good drive"
1208, a year ago,5,It’s been a great car for my sister..... it’s great in gas....... it gets in spaces a lot of cars can’t
1209,a year ago,4,mis muy bueno tienen un modelo muy bonito es una muy buena marca de carro tiene mucha capacidad de velocidad y mucho espacio para los pasajeros

1213, a year ago,5,This is the only car I’ve ever driven and I’ve had no issues with it I really like it and will probably always use it
1214, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my 4Runner! This is my second I have owned. It is such a great vehicle! I live in Wyoming and winter driving can be scary but with my 4Runner I have zero worries! It is spacious yet not too big. It comes with so many great features and keeps it's value so well! Plus, JUST LOOK AT IT!! My model is a 2021 Nightshade in Pearl White."
1215, a year ago,2,It’s not very stylish looking it’s very compact doesn’t have enough power I guess it’s a good car if you are just going around the neighborhood
1216, a year ago,5,Smooth ride! Easy to adjust seat and steering wheel for my size. Love the back camera feature and the music sounds great
1217, a year ago,5,Si buscas comodidad para ti y tu Familia o amigos esta camioneta es la mejor y la calidad mucho mejor es lo principal ante todo .
1218, a year ago,5,"I have never personally owned this vehicle. However, my father in law is obsessed with his Toyota Corolla. I have comfortably sat in the back with two other children and one in a front facing carseat. It seems to even have enough leg room in the back and front passenger seat as well, rides smooth."

1220, a year ago,4,"I wish the windshield was a bit bigger, but overall a solid, reliable car. Has a decent amount of space for items and comfortable seating"
1221, a year ago,5,"This car was not mine, but I definitely drove it a handful of times and it’s fast! The look is sleek and has a smooth ride :)"
1222, a year ago,4,Very reliable car. An old 1998 camry was my first car. Very good on gas. Didn't seem to have major known problems with regular maintenance. I haven't seen the newer camrys though so I'm not sure if they are the same quality the older ones were known to be.
1223, a year ago,5,"This is my second 4Runner in 15 years. I had my first one for 10 and plan to keep this one for as long as I can! They are proven to last long and have a smooth drive. They have been reliable and durable and have all the elements that I want to have in a car. Seat warmers and coolers, a navigation system and they just keep getting g better! I would highly recommend this car!"
1224,a year ago,5,"Cette petite voiture a vraiment tout d'une grande(comme le dit la pub). sa taille me permet de me faufiler partout sans problème et son rayon de braquage est vraiment exceptionnel. Quand à la capacité de son coffre, on peut y glisser vraiment beaucoup de chose. Je l'adore!"
1225, a year ago,5,"I have a 1998 Toyota 4Runner and when I tell you this is the most reliable truck I mean it. Toyota can last a long time if they are kept up and painted correctly my car is a reflection of that. I would like to upgrade to a newer model soon however, I love my baby :)"
1226, a year ago,5,Love the exterior of the new RAV 4 and the big screen in the middle! Really spacious
1227, a year ago,4,It’s a great car! I’ve had it for a while and hasn’t caused too many problems! I would def recommend if you’re in the market for one
1228, a year ago,5,Omg.  I love renting this car.  Always super cheap and available.  Great on gas.  Nice features too.  My perfect travel car to rent.

1230, a year ago,5,Love my yota.   Great on gas. Easy maintenance. And the dealer rer ship I purchased at gives me free car washes for life of my car.
1231, a year ago,3,I like Toyota’s but the rav4 wasn’t my favorite. This particular model had the tire on the back so it was very heavy to open the trunk.
1232, a year ago,4,This one my first car in high school. It was a perfect little car that really had no issues!
1233, a year ago,4,Very convenient for a first time driver or for a first car. Car runs very good and small to fit in small places and parkings.
1234, a year ago,5,I love the Toyota vehicles. The Prius saves on gas and drives like a dream. This is my second Prius and love it just as much as my first one.
1235, a year ago,5,"It was a great car. Roomy, great fuel mileage. Great redesign and sporty. Plenty of back seat room."
1236, a year ago,4,"First car I ever bought was a Toyota Corolla. It was a great little car but I was young when I bought it and I wish I would have just bought a new one. Not knowing any better I bought a used one, and I think it may have been used as a rental car previously. There is nothing wrong with a preowned car, but just do your research. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was preowned strip down model."
1237, a year ago,5,Toyotas are the best. Next time I buy a car and for the rest of my life it will be a Toyota. I love Honda too but Toyotas are the best and they have better air conditioners. Basically my whole immediate family buys Toyotas and nothing else. and most of the extended family has Toyotas or Hondas as well.
1238, a year ago,5,I have an older 03 Camry but it takes me from point A to point B and that’s all I need it to do! It is also very fuel efficient and is very low maintenance! Parts are additionally very easy to find and are affordable! I love it!
1239, a year ago,4,"Nice car, love riding in it. Smooth ride. The speed can get away from you if you don’t watch it. Gas mileage is great."
1240, a year ago,5,"I had a manual 1998 Toyota Celica Convertible for my first car and I miss it so much! It had leather bucket seats, an incredible heater, a great sound system, automatic/manual retracting top, automatic windows. It was truly my Barbie car and as an Adult with a real world job, I would be thrilled if Toyota would bring them back."
1241, a year ago,5,"This a perfect size car for a small family (3) super smooth and fast at the same time, I really love this car"
1242, a year ago,1,"not very good, the price is higher thsn others and it works the same, you have many other options, its good if you like the style, but personally i would go for other options for a cheaoer price but besides that everything's good and they have pretty colors"
1243, a year ago,4,Excellent gas mileage. I can see why this car is so popular. Could not think of 1 thing I disliked about this car. Fantastic purchase.
1244, a year ago,5,"I will forever be a fan of toyota vehicles. Specifically the corolla. Now I am fairly partial to these cars. Mostly because I started driving with an 05 corolla. Each time I traded in...it was to get a new car n ended with a corolla. I've had the 05, 2010, 2013 and now 2020. I am in love with my 2020. From the color to the standard things that come with it. Lane travel assist and the way the brakes r when u step on them n they blink 3 times. I love it!"
1245,a year ago,4,"The Camry is much more spacious in comparison to the Corolla. Still small, however, I was able to sit in the back seat quite comfortably."
1246,a year ago,3,"This car got me from point A to point B. I am 5’8”. When I wasn’t the driver, I felt so crammed in the car. Especially when I was sitting in the back seat."
1247,a year ago,4,"Spacious and reliable car for family. Though I am not too much of a fan when it comes to the style, it comes in handy for our long road trips across the country."
1248, a year ago,4,Good gas mileage. This is the car I learned how to drive in during drivers Ed. Easy on the pedals good maneuver ability.
1249, a year ago,5,Recently purchased a 2020 Highlander Hybrid XLE and I’m obsessed. Amazing features and it’s a super smooth ride. I opted for captain seats in the second row and it feels so spacious. The trunk space is unreal even with the third row of seats up.
1250, a year ago,5,"Nice car! Small, compact, suv. I wish they had better paint colors to choose from. Toyota makes well made cars that will run for a long time."
1251, a year ago,5,"My best friend had this car. I thought it was cute, got great gas mileage. I’d love to have one."
1252, a year ago,5,"I was brought home from the hospital in a Toyota Corolla, and purchased one for my first car!  That car I bought is the one I'm still driving today.  It's getting a little old, but it's incredibly reliable.  The only problems I've had were caused by people or things on the highway hitting me! I would purchase another one of these, though at times I've wished I'd gotten a hatchback, or something with larger/more comfortable seating.  "

1256, a year ago,5,This is the best car out there!! It has great gas mileage. The quality of a Toyota is unbeatable. They are so safe and affordable. I would highly te come de this car to anyone driving a bunch of miles!
1257, a year ago,5,I had a camry many years ago. It was a great car. Only reason I got rid of it was because I needed a bigger vehicle to transport my children & their friends around in
1258,a year ago,5,"Rapido, ahorra gas, excelente motor, espacioso, es excellent carro , se consiguen repuestos, es bastante popular, traction en las 4 ruedas"
1259,a year ago,4,"Highs Attractive design, optional hybrid powertrain, generous standard features. Lows Few driving thrills, skimpy third-row room, fussy interior styling"
1260,a year ago,5,"I used to have a 4runner and I have no negatives about it at all. I used and abused that poor thing and it just took it like a champ. It was smaller than most SUVs but roomy enough for our family of 4. The fuel economy was pretty decent. It handled excellent in all weather conditions. I have 5 kids now, so I'm stuck driving a minivan for at least another 8 years, but I definitely wouldnt mind replacing it with another 4runner when the time comes."
1261, a year ago,5,"Je l’aime, mon mari en a toujours acheté du Corolla, ils sont très fiables. Ils ne consomment pas beaucoup d’essence. Je le recommandé énormément!"
1262, a year ago,5,I love Toyota's they drive great and last forever. I prefer Toyota over Honda. I think the repairs are cheaper and I had less issues with my toyota.
1263, a year ago,4,"Great little car. The gas mileage is great and the ride is decently smooth, for a smaller car. I feel like this car will also be easy to teach my teenager how to drive in, and feel safe about it."
1264,a year ago,4,"It is a comfortable, practical, low-maintenance, economical vehicle. It's a very good option for those who cannot have an expensive vehicle."
1265, a year ago,4,"I shopped around for SUV's and test drove many vehicles from high to low end models. We absolutely fell in love with the RAV4, lots of leg room and very spacious even with 5 people in the vehicle. I found this SUV to be worth the investment with options to personalize with upgrades. Lastly, great gas consumption."
1266,a year ago,5,I think this car is great compared to the others I have owned. I've always been told Toyota and hondas last forever. I would improve the space inside the car I wish it was a little more room on the inside. I think the price is fairly. I would recommend!  Toyota Camry
1267, a year ago,5,"My roommate has this vehicle and it is amazing. The only thing is not having a sunroof, you have to get it as a custom add on when purchasing the vehicle but other than that, it has everything right."
1268, a year ago,5,"My family has had almost every model of 4Runner. I drove a early 90’s model as my first car for a bit, they’re amazing vehicles. Can’t wait to get my own."
1269, a year ago,5,"Amazing vehicle, super safe, fast, comfortable, beautiful interior, great stock sound system. All the bells and whistles you need for hands free."
1270, a year ago,3,Nice car but it is not All Wheel Drive and i insist on AWD.   Nice exterior  and interior and holds its value.  So nice for someone else. 
1271, a year ago,5,This is the best vehicle that you can buy Toyota always makes the best vehicles. I highly recommend the Toyota Sienna. It's long lasting.

1273, a year ago,5,"Very reliable car, extremely affordable, get great gas mileage. Perfect commuter car"
1274, a year ago,5,Great fo family and kids. So many opportunities to rig it up and take it in many adventures. Highly recommend
1275, a year ago,4,I like this car. Saves a lot of money on gas. It’s kinda small and one thing I absolutely hate about the car is air circulation. Nothing ever gets to the back unless you are sitting in the middle. I like the add on features like Apple play and maps that hook up to your phone and the -your not in your lane- signal. Really helpful sometimes
1276, a year ago,5,"Excellent economy car, low gas milage. I love the Toyota service department when I go for oil change and tire rotation. Improvement would be the headlight covers become cloudy and looks terrible. This problem has been going on for years Economical price and I will buy again."
1277, a year ago,5,Literally love my car. It is a 2007 Toyota Camry and it is in great shape. Even being an older model the design does not look outdated. I don’t drive much so the mileage is pretty low still and I haven’t had many mechanical issues over the years but have had to fix a few minor things. Over all it is a great car and would purchase the same kind again.
1278, a year ago,4,"Très bonne voiture, solide et efficace, rapide et fiable. Celle que j’ai essayé n’était pas la gamme de luxe, les sièges en tissu et confort basique mais était confortable et faisait son travail. Je recommence cette voiture"
1279, a year ago,3,"Got this car when I was a student, small and convenient to park anywhere in downtown. It wasn’t powerful but it was enough because I was living in a sunny country but I’m not sure it would be very convenient in a snow country like Canada. To be determined"
1280, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota Corolla. It’s sporty looking but practical. It drives smooth. Toyota dealers are always helpful.
1281,a year ago,5,I have driven Toyota’s for years. To be honest my 4Runner is my favorite. I have the 2007 4WD and most people mistake it for something slightly younger. It drives great and I like the design better than the newer models.
1282, a year ago,5,Amazing truck will run forever and parts are easy to come by!! Smooth ride and lot of room!
1283, a year ago,3,This is a great car but like most cars the more you spy the more equipment it has. They have improved a lot over the years. I have a 2011 and the wind from the window it’s a 7 I can hear a lot of noises the car quality it’s also a 7 it’s fragile. My regular driving seat it’s damaged from me sliding in and out and that extra space is better than my old other brand name.  Overall it’s economic and good.
1284, a year ago,5,"This is the second Toyota Camry I’ve owned in the past 15 years. I love, love, love my Yota ! Neither car ever broke down on me. All I have to do is change the oil and do basic  vehicle care. Plan to have this one for seven more years. After that- Betsy will still be an awesome trade- in for someone else to enjoy for at least seven years."
1285, a year ago,5,Hands down the best vehicle I’ve ever owned. 1998 4runner with 311000 miles on it and daily drive it 29 miles round trip.
1286, a year ago,5,"Great product. Big, spacious and very luxury. This is a truck for a big family, fas milage isnt as good as other toyota cars but it have all the toyota quality"
1287, a year ago,4,"I really like this suv. It's got a decent backseat, a fair amount of room in the trunk. It can fit 2 carseats decently, although you do lose some legroom in the front when rearfacing. It's fairly affordable, I'd recommend it if it is in your budget."
1288, a year ago,5,"Very good car, reliable and comfortable for the whole family. I use it everyday for the last 4 years and u havent experience ant defects. Definetely recommended for a person that drives a fair amount of miles everyday"
1289, a year ago,5,"I looove Prius! It is what inspired me to get a hybrid, after being a passenger in one. I loved the gas mileage and being able to see the battery charging when driving, it was great! They're a little more expensive than their counterparts. I'd still recommend it."
1290, a year ago,5,"I lovvvvveeee my Toyota Camry. It is a hybrid 4 door sedan. The gas mileage is great, I have heated seats, leather interior, and an internal GPS. I'd improve the lcd display for the a/c and heat. It's really great for cost after purchase, I don't need to buy gas often, and I've personally never had any issues with it aside from a flat tire, which was no longer an issue after I got new tires. Totally recommend."
1291, a year ago,5,Nice car! Toyota’s will last forever! Camrys have been around since the beginning of time so you know it will be a wise investment
1292, a year ago,5,"We owned a 2006 Toyota Highlander and traded it in for $10,000 towards our new rav4.  We could have kept going since we only hit 100000 miles before the trade in."
1293, a year ago,5,"We bought a new 2018 Toyota RAV4 and have been very pleased. It runs great, drives smoothly and sips gas. The Toyota care service is nice too.  I plan to get many more years out of it."
1294, a year ago,5,"I have wanted this vehicle for a very long time but always talked myself out of purchasing a newer vehicle.  Well this time I said - Toyota is a great manufacturer of vehicles, they have great longevity, it was the size I wanted and well I just LOVE IT!  I am so happy with my purchase and I will keep it forever!  #toyotaforlife #4runner #suv Toyota 4Runner"
1295, a year ago,5,I like this car because it has space and the feel of the inside is so homey. I like it that it does give you that grand feeling of having a fancy car and or luxury car because of the inside interior design. Easy to clean and the money saving for gas; this car doesn't use up gas that much.
1296, a year ago,5,"My first car I got was  Toyota Celica and I love the vibe I get from it, does give you that hint of sport car and convenient car to use on a daily basis. Doesn't cost a lot to take care of and the bonus is that you save up on money for gas especially when it doesn't use a lot."
1297, a year ago,4,My brother got this car and I have to say it is nice on the inside however I would not buy one for myself just because it does use up a bit of gas and the cost to take care of the car is pretty high.
1298, a year ago,4,This van is very accessible and easy to use. If you have a big family I would recommend especially when you need auto doors that slides open and close when you are shopping and or need on the go. I like that there is space and that it is easy to clean whereas smaller cars can be a hassle for me. 
1299, a year ago,5,My best friend has one of these and has had the car for over 5 years. It still runs great and she hasn't really put a lot of money into getting it fixed.
1300, a year ago,5,"My husband to be decided that since we were having our first child it was time to purchase a safe and reliable vehicle, it's amazing on gas, it's safer to drive than our previous cars, and I like the radio set up and that I can make calls safely and hands free, and i like the fact that it also tells you the temperature and if ice may be on the road, and a bonus to me, auto lights! Toyota Corolla"
1301, a year ago,5,I love my Camry! It’s comfortable to drive and my SE V6 has a lot of power for merging and passing.
1302, a year ago,5,I love my car. I have the base model so I wish I had upgraded just so I had heated seats. I love the way it drives and how reliable it is.
1303, a year ago,5,I loved the interior of this car. It was spacious and I loved the touch screen in the car. It is great on gas as well.

1312, a year ago,5,My Matrix is awesome!  170k miles in and it has never required any major work.  It is my commuter car and with its low maintenance profile it fits right in with my lifestyle.  Gas mileage is incredible which also fits in my lifestyle especially when gas prices skyrocket.
1313, a year ago,5,"Lots of driver assistance technology, love the big screen and the Apple car play. It also has a good fuel economy and its a very comfortable compact car to drive around and travel in. The safety features like lane assist are very useful, and the excellent sound system as well. Sometimes the engine can be a bit loud when accelerating but overall the car feels very smooth when driving it. The car is reasonably priced, fuel efficient, and a very reliable car."
1314, a year ago,4,This car is perfect for a small family or a single person. There is plenty of room in trunk and in the front seats as well.
1315, a year ago,5,When I had my RAV4 I absolutely loved it. So easy to drive & it wasn’t too big to park
1316,a year ago,5,My rav4 is now 10 years old and still working. It saves me a lot of money on gas. It has 2 extra seats (total of 7) that can be folded for space. Its low maintenance. I am very happy with toyota and how my car has lasted
1317, a year ago,4,I had a Toyota Echo 2004 5 speed (basically the same as a Yaris). Super easy to drive but got rid of it for a newer car with a great deal!
1318, a year ago,5,I knew I wanted a Camry without even trying it and I wasn't disappointed. It drives great and I feel safe always. I love the features and it was a great deal. I got service a few weeks ago and the Toyota center was super helpful and friendly!
1319, a year ago,5,"I like Toyota Corolla. Italy Grandma’s favorite car. it will always remind me him, he always gets a Corolla"
1320, a year ago,4,"My husband has always talked up Toyota, so when I had one as a rental recently I had high expectations. However, out of all the sedans I have rented over the years the Corolla was my least favorite. It was just not as comfortable of a drive."
1321, a year ago,5,I loved my Yaris. It was so small but comfortable to sit in. I had to upgrade to a Toyota Kleugar because I had 3 kids in 3 years
1322, a year ago,4,"Camry vehicles are nice and ride smoothly. The interiors are comfortable and easily accommodate someone with a larger frame. You don't get a ton of road noise which is nice. Price can vary based on the features you choose. Overall, they are dependable."
1323, a year ago,5,This is a great car. It’s spacious and it’s has a good deal of cargo room. It’s not a very fast car but it a safe car. It’s perfect for moms or dads who need a little extra space. The car is super reliable and affordable
1324, a year ago,4,This is a comfortable ride for short or long trips. It has plenty of room and many accessories which I used on a daily basis.
1325, a year ago,5,Best car ever! I have the limited platinum hybrid and couldn’t be happier. Gas mileage is fantastic for a full sized SUV.Toyota Highlander

1327,a year ago,5,"This is a smooth ride 😎. I really like the feel of the pedals and the clean-cut, beautiful interior of the car. It is so exciting to drive this car. It's very fuel efficient and I like the color of the car."
1328, a year ago,4,I like it because it is a spacious off-road car and apart from that the toyota is a very good car the only bad thing is that it consumes a lot of fuel but I love it for the snow season
1329, a year ago,3,"Even at the highest package I feel like this is a very basic sporty car. I absolutely hate the interior fake pleather on the dash board on over to where the airbags are. Feels like it will rip if I just look at it. Ok on gas mileage, Overall this car is just ok. It does do good in the snow. "
1330, a year ago,2,I love the looks of this vehicle however they have the absolute worse blind spots. The FJ is notorious for having cracks in the frame which are unsafe and have been recalled. I like toyota but the only thing this has going for it is the exterior looks.
1331,a year ago,3,This was our rental car on vacation.  It’s fine.  Nothing special.  I would not buy this for myself but it was a good rental car.
1332, a year ago,5,"Love the sporty and rugged look of this SUV. Does well in the mountains and in the city of Denver. Great for its price, ok on gas mileage, love the sporty interior as well. You can get this vehicle with 2 or 3 rows depending on your needs but the 3rd row which has plenty of space for tall women like me who are 5'10. Leg room is important and this vehicle has it. "
1333, a year ago,4,"Great car, will last a long time, maintenance cost is rather low to fix any problems. Decent on gas mileage, cheap for your general commuter car, Great reliability, does well in the snow which is important since I live in Colorado and travel in snow and ice through the mountains. "
1334, a year ago,5,I had my Camry since we bought it new in 2015. My son has my car now and I can tell you that this car can take a beating. There is nothing that I would improve other than the touch screen going out in the corners over time. I will be looking at another Toyota when I purchase.
1335, a year ago,5,"I love our Matrix. It’s served as a great family car for 14 years. 212,000 miles and still running strong."
1336,a year ago,4,"Recently purchased a 2016 4Runner. This car has been great, uses quite a bit of gas, but that was to be expected. Does great here in colorado, but I have yet to drive it in the snow to see how it is. I’m looking forward to taking it up into the mountains!"
1337, a year ago,5,Upgraded to the highlander from the RAV4 when I found out I was pregnant! I’m obsessed! It drives just like the RAV4 and you don’t feel like your in a giant car trying to navigate. Amazing trunk space even with the third row! Started as a lease but buying it outright once the lease is over!
1338,a year ago,5,My mom drives a Highlander and she loves it. It’s super comfortable and spacious. Fits all of our groceries and then some.
1339,a year ago,5,"I love my rav4 and it’s the best car out there. Not to small and not to big, it truly is the perfect car. I test drive a few and none of the rest competed with this one."
1340, a year ago,5,We have an 07 and we love it. It still rides good. We plan to keep this car forever!
1341, a year ago,5,"Was our family car for a few years. Great car, spacious trunk space. Held about 7 people. Had car in burgundy, smooth car"
1342, a year ago,5,I believe this is literally one of the safest vehicles we just got hit a couple days ago. The person that rear ended us fled when we looked back the car didn't have anything but a scratch. We were surprised by how hard we felt the other car hit.
1343, a year ago,4,"Interior not very spacious, but has very good mileage. Easy, efficient, casual ride. But definitely A classic car for many families"
1344, a year ago,5,"Everything is perfect for my space. My vehicle is currently a competitor, I am thinking of changing for Toyota Sequoia when I had the opportunity to test the deeler and I fell in love."
1345, a year ago,5,My niece has this vehicle and it is comfortable for her. It is not my favorite but it seems to me that it is a great vehicle.
1346, a year ago,5,"My husband's car is currently fascinated by Hybrido because he does not use gasoline to travel for two people, it is perfect, but for 5 the idea is not good."
1347, a year ago,5,"A great SUV for family and to carry all your traveling needs. Third row seat is a great plus and like that you can have up or lay them flat. Passengers have their own control of the heat/cooling system, big plus for our family. Could improve on the door/window sealing of front doors. If windy you can hear it sneaking in or sounds like it. "
1348,a year ago,3,"I was surprised that I liked the shape and style of the Toyota Corolla.  The rear camera was amazing to use and it had some great features.  However, it had no power and wasn't that great on fuel economy.  But overall it better that what I expected."
1349, a year ago,5,"My husband was for a few weeks with the toyota sienna and I had the opportunity to guide and be a passenger and I liked it a lot since we also had a baby I liked all the space, the color, and that happened 23 years ago today to improved a lot."
1350, a year ago,5,"My husband rented the Toyota camry 3 years ago and I liked it, I felt light to guide and comfortable the hundreds of others, also comfortable."
1351, a year ago,5,My sister had a Toyota yaris but for me it does not work because I am tall and the car is low for me but it seems to me that it is a good car.
1352, a year ago,5,"We love the Rav4. We've had it for 3 years. Very comfortable and the most reliable vehicles on the road. The gas mileage is not fantastic and the tank is a little small. We would absolutely buy another, but with all of the options!"
1353,a year ago,5,I had the chance to drive one of the newer RAV4’s and I will be buying one in 2021 because of how much I liked it. The car seems very reliable and I loved the safety features. The new exterior look is amazing too!
1354, a year ago,4,"It’s ok, my husband has it as a company car. The dashboard is nice but not super comfortable. I wouldn’t mind renting one but not to buy"
1355, a year ago,5,"My dad just recently purchased a 4runner. He absolutely loves it! His came with a rack on the top of his car. I rode in the car while he was driving, and I really like how high up I feel, and how smooth the ride is. I like how the seats fold down super easily with no effort!"
1356, a year ago,5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY 4 RUNNER! It’s very spacious and very safe. I have a nightshade and it’s my favorite vehicle to date
1357, a year ago,4,"Solid vehicle. For the price, Toyota doesn’t include any luxuries at all. Still, we like the brand as much as anyone. Good vehicle. Safe. Runs forever. Will keep buying from the brand."
1358, a year ago,5,"We love our FJ! We have the original, first release. It’s a great vehicle. Do not buy the standard. It has a lot of issues, go automatic. (Which we would normally advise against) lots of upgrades available."
1359, a year ago,5,Toyota is a great brand and a  Reliable brand with longevity. You can see Toyota brand on streets and can be years old and still running good and worth the money you spend.  I have no cons with the brand.
1360, a year ago,5,"My son has this car, i like so much is very spacious for a big family also is the car i want in the future. Love it!!!!’"
1361, a year ago,5,So in love with the way it drives! Super good on gas! It was a little small for my preference and takes a little longer to take off. It is eco friendly so that was a plus. It is also affordable!!!  I did feel safe in it so I would personally recommended for your loved ones!!! 
1362, a year ago,5,My mother owns a Toyota Sienna and it is very spacious. We love taking family trips in her van and drives great! I would have TVs in the back of the seats just as a plus. It is very affordable as well. We purchased it from my boyfriends car dealer brokers company. 
1363, a year ago,5,I love my baby !!! She’s a hot wheels and the mileage is great to have the roads ‘ and rides smooth
1364, a year ago,4,I used to have one. I loved that it was amazing car. It was great with gas mileage and drove very smooth and roomy. Wasn't liking that if was so close to the ground.
1365, a year ago,4,I have one now and I love it. I have an older version but I still love that has mileage is amazing. I just dont like the fact that it sits so low.
1366, a year ago,5,I have had my Corolla for over 10 years and it still runs great! Little to no problems and very reliable. I only need something to get me local and the occasional trip to the beach. Love the smooth ride
1367, a year ago,5,"I have a 2001 toyota camry and that was my first car. This car has held up perfectly in many winters, still drives like a champ and I refuse to sell it. They definitely hold their value and hold up through the years. 10/10 would recommend!!!!!!!"
1368, a year ago,5,"2019 model, still has new car smell. Rides smooth and has third row folding seats. Back cabin air vents."
1369, a year ago,4,"I do love my RAV! I am 5’1 and have a couple blind spots. My model doesn’t have air vents in the back row, this isn’t ideal for hot summers and cold winters. However, it does hold my family of 4 currently my 2
Children in car seats,
Comfortably. Toyota products last and I am overall, happy with my purchase."
1370, a year ago,5,"My dad just got this car and it has had huge improvements! It drives smooth and doesn’t feel like a truck at all. The ceilings could be a little higher, but the whole family fits comfortably! This is a great road trip car especially with all the room in the trunk!_"
1371, a year ago,5,This is a great car my parents own one it drives smooth and has awesome extra features they average 40mpg
1372,a year ago,5,"metro encanta este auto. la belleza es unica. no me canso de usarlo. cada vezque me subo ando poir todos lados sin querer bajarme. 100% recomendable, su seguridad es especial me siento muy seguro conduciendolo. es el mejor que coduci y volveria a hacerlo"
1373,a year ago,5,excelente vehiculo.  muy comodo para andar. lo recomendaria 100%. re conforme con lo que brinda. una verdadera maquina. si tendria que adquirir un vehiculo nuevo lo elegiria de vuelta. es muy bueno de verdad y muy economico en cuanto a gasto de combustible 
1374, a year ago,5,"I loved my Camry, 2005 basic package and still going. It’s been an amazing car the entire time, no major issues at all! A few minor things are breaking now. We will trade in soon for a SUV due to a now larger young family than when I purchased it. Other than that I have loved it."
1375, a year ago,5,"It’s  a compact car that has a lot of room inside.  Runs smooth, it’s gas efficient ."
1376,a year ago,5,"It is a good car, it never gave any problems with its maintenance only the basic one.  Economical on gasoline.  It is true that it does not attract attention but it is not designed for that nor does it pretend to be a sports car, it is a car for day to day"
1377, a year ago,5,"My mom drives a Camry. Compared to my Corolla, it is noticeably larger and hence more comfortable when travelling with my dad and husband. Her Camry is an older model than my Corolla but perfect for her. However, I know the new models of Camrys tout more luxurious options. Still, the larger car comes with a higher pricetag, which was not justified for me personally."
1378, a year ago,5,"I love the Rav4, but it was out of my price range. I know that the Rav4 is not even comparable to the Corolla as it is a completely different kind of vehicle, but if I were in the market for switching to a small, sporty SUV, then it would have been my top pick."
1379, a year ago,4,"I considered the Prius when purchasing my last car, but chose the Corolla inatead. The Corolla had a bigger fuel tank, lower starting price, and I personally liked the look and feel of it better too. I knew that I had to give up the better fuel econom of the Prius as well as the larger cabin and cargo room, but I was OK with that. My last 3 cars have all been Corollas, so there had to be really great reasons to switch."
1380, a year ago,5,"I am not a car connoisseur. I like an affordable car that can get me from Point A to Point B reliably. I have been rear-endeded twice, and both times I decided to get a brand new Corolla by trading it rather than fixing it. I like the seat warmers and the easy to clean fabric inside as well."
1381, a year ago,4,The car itself is very small on the inside and cramped feeling. The drive is nice though
1382, a year ago,5,"This thing runs forever. It has legit over 300,000 miles and I swear I’ve only ever gotten an oil change and new tires."
1383, a year ago,5,Love love love our sienna! It’s spacious and comfortable for all of us. the back seats fold all the way down and leave the back end large enough for a twin sized bed. There is also enough cup holders for like 20 people it’s a great  vehicle.
1384,a year ago,5,"I love my Corolla! If I ever want to upgrade, I will definitely go back and get the newest Corolla again. I love how reliable it is and the fuel cost is good to my budget."
1385, a year ago,5,My favorite little car. It has the best gas mileage and is comfy for long road hauls. I will definitely purchase another one as my kids get older.
1386, a year ago,4,"This is a very safe and reliable car. However, if you are wanting space and comfort I would not recommend this car. I recently took a road trip in one and it was just not too comfortable. It is great on gas and would be good for a work car or beginner."
1387, a year ago,5,Camrys are a great car. They are great on gas mileage as well. If you are looking for a easy car to drive this is a go to!
1388, a year ago,5,"Once again, Toyota is a great and reliable brand. The RAV4 is a very comfortable mini SUV. It has so much room and is very comfortable. This is a great car and I would definitely recommend test driving one."
1389, a year ago,5,"This is a great vehicle. Toyota is a safe and reliable brand that will last you for years and years. The 4Runner has plenty of room as well as many other awesome features. If you are looking at buying a new or used SUV, you have to look at the Toyota 4Runner!"
1390, a year ago,5,A RAV was the first car I learned to drive in and when it was the time for me to buy my first car there was no question what I wanted to return to. I feel safe with the size and build of my car and comfortable with the interior design and accessories that are provided with a RAV.
1391, a year ago,4,"Very spacious. Seats 8 comfortably with plenty of room for storage. This van drives very nicely, the turning radius makes it easy to park!"
1392, a year ago,5,"I like this one super cool in highway, super gas saver, any kind of weather doesn’t matter"
1393, a year ago,5,"Love my car. It's aforable economical, and the perfect size! It also has different modes on the car snow, dirt and speed. I don't really notice a difference on each mode but they are good to have. Also connects to apple music and android play. I do need to have the connection cord attached to have the maps work but it's a great vehicle."
1394, a year ago,5,"Beautiful car. Runs great! The white color doesn’t look like it’s dirty, even if it is really dirty. The car has plenty of space in the back to storing things and also space in the back for people to sit comfortably. Love it!"
1395, a year ago,5,I’ve owned a lot of vehicles in my life and I will have to say that the Toyota Corolla is defining in my top 3!  It drives and handles smooth. It drives great on these West Virginia roads! It’s sporty yet practical. I will be driving it for a long time .
1396, a year ago,5,This is my first car I've bought that was less than 8 years old. I was lucky to get a good deal on it. I have a 2019 and really love it! It is so quiet. I like the touch screen and the backup cam which are new features to me. I also love how quick the heater heats up.
1397, a year ago,4,This is the first reliable vehicle I’ve owned so of course I’m happy with it. It is however a V6 engine and my gas mileage is not great. I’d definitely recommend Toyota.
1398, a year ago,5,"We have the TRD package and absolutely love it! It gets great gas mileage and handles off roading with ease. It doesn’t come with cross bars on the roof rack, which I don’t like. But overall a great mid size SUV that handles like a truck!"
1399, a year ago,5,"2015 - love the sunroof, bluetooth, gps, radio. this was my favorite car ever! even in an accident, it held up when i broke my back"
1400, a year ago,4,i have an 09. a little outdated but i love the toyota brand. that’s why i bought the car used!
1401, a year ago,5,I love my Rav4.  Toyota is a great car manufacturer and has been my go to make for a very long time. These are great family vehicles and are very reliable.
1402, a year ago,5,Love my Toyota Highlander.   Drives so smoothly.   Love the safety features such as the blind spot mirrors and the large backup display on the dash
1403,a year ago,4,"I think it’s an awesome product, I deal on cars and I can vocally say that it’s an amazing and complete quality product, affordable and convenient for anyone who seeks a long last car."
1404, a year ago,4,This is a very reliable model car!! It is good on gas and only needs checkups every few thousand miles or so. I haven't had anything gone wrong with it and I've had it for 5 years. It has alot of leg room and is great for road trips .
1405, a year ago,5,My RAV4 has been great. I got it after my 2004 CR-V was in an accident. The gas mileage is decent for a 2010 but I think they now make a hybrid that’s even better. It can store a lot— I used it to move myself across the country. It’s a small suv without feeling too small or too big.
1406, a year ago,5,Owned a 2012 Camry Hybrid and this vehicle was excellent. Very reliable and fuel economy was amazing. I was able to drive from Edmonton to Penticton on one tank of gas! Very comfortable and spacious interior! Highly recommend.
1407, a year ago,4,This car had been good on gas. A very comfortable good car to drive. Not to big for someone that is short.
1408, a year ago,5,"I love my Prius C, it gets me from point A to B and my fuel economy is amazing! I can get about 800 km on a single tank of gas and I do a fair bit of highway driving. I have the technology package which I highly recommend. It’s 6 years old and maintenance has been minimal (knock on wood!). Great vehicle, very reliable!!"
1409, a year ago,5,Obsessed with my RAV4! I feel safe while driving it and it is a reliable car. I will repurchase these forever. Great resale value as well
1410, a year ago,5,I love my 4 runner! It’s roomy and comfortable and keeps my family safe. I love that I can still pull a trailer and even my small 2 horse trailer can be pulled fully loaded. Love it!
1411, a year ago,5,"I used to own a Camry and it lasted over 15 years (I bought it used) and rode it until ""the wheels fell off""! A very reliable car to own. "
1412, a year ago,5,Great product to use and own. Very handy and was just what i was looking for and needed. This product went above and beyond my expectations and highly recommended it to all♡
1413, a year ago,4,This vehicle is like a cult classic. It is similarly called the Pontiac Vibe. These cars will run forever. They're not very good looking but highly recommended for storage while still owning a compact car. They are affordable and reliable vehicles. 
1414, a year ago,4,"The Sienna is a favorite among families. It is very roomy, enough storage for sports gear, or what not. The sliding back doors are convenient when you have your hands full. A very good buy for families with small children. It isn't the most affordable of the minivans, but it's safety standard is very high. "
1415, a year ago,4,"This vehicle looks stylish but you have to keep up on the maintenance. Toyota products are very reliable and maintenance is easy. It's comfortable. and affordable. Not as affordable as others, but you get what you pay for. Very safe car. "
1416, a year ago,5,"Holds their value, high quality made vehicle, tough yet rides smooth. Doesn’t feel top heavy even with a luggage rack. Roomy and comfortable. All around phenomenal vehicle for a fair price"
1417, a year ago,3,This vehicle rode well and was comfortable but did not have the packing space I would have expected for a family vehicle. It was easy to get kids into car seats so that was a plus. I could recommend
1418, a year ago,4,Very nicely made whilst being comfortable and stylish. Servicing/ maintenance is cheap and simple and always readily accessible at any mechanic/ dealership.
1419, a year ago,5,Foo curse the best Toyota out right now is the Camry ! Not much to say except I NEED ONE!!!
1420, a year ago,5,Oh I love my camarys I've had 3 of them and all of them 3 lol. There safe to drive. Great family car. Gets you where you need to go in a safe timely manner
1421, a year ago,5,"This is a great car for sure, I love the features and the different types of sleek lines it has. I do not like that some parts are plastic but it is an affordable car. Def recommend! Great car! Would buy again"
1422, a year ago,5,"I love Toyota. I have a 2001 Toyota Corolla and it only has 130,000 miles on it. It’s only had some minor fixes and it does need air conditioning but it is reliable and never seems to fail! I will keep it as long as I can!"
1423, a year ago,5,"Best car I’ve ever driven. Rides smoothly, parts are really cheap and easy to get and easy to change out yourself. A money saver"

1427, a year ago,4,"Es un carro muy bueno es resistente,de colores hermosos y tiene comodidad , y sobre todo súper económico es un carro chico !!!"
1428, a year ago,5,La voiture parfaite pour une conduite citadine. Elle dépense pas beaucoup en essence. Très économique ne fait pas de bruit. Et moteur très costaud.
1429, a year ago,4,"This is an older model that was given to us.  It runs great.  Besides the normal wear and tear, it is like new."
1430,a year ago,5,Just surrendered my 2002 4runner after 14 years of ownership. Toyota is a brand that has a reputation of being reliable and long lasting.
1431, a year ago,5,"I LOVE THIS Car! Cheap, affordable, can be negotiated down in price at a good dealership; 10/10 suggest"
1432, a year ago,4,Very good car has soo much space especially for those who have a big family has a big space in the trunk the seats are removable which is good its a very comfortable car to drive in
1433, a year ago,5,Got the sports edition rav4 when my car was totalled. It was honestly the best car I’ve driven in awhile. I loved everything about it.

1436, a year ago,5,I wanted a large car. It’s a bit on the more expensive side. This car only takes synthetic oil for oil changes.  Three rows of seats and a sun roof
1437, a year ago,5,"Good quality, my favorite family car so far. Big enough to bring home new furniture. It fits two big car seats on the second raw and two big dogs on the third. The third raw is comfortable for any passenger under 5'9"", so you can bring your extended family with you (don't do it). The car has many USB charges around, works wonderfully with Android Auto, has AUX, and a good sound system. It is good with gas, very economical, and easy to service."
1438,a year ago,5,"El mejor carro del mundo! Amo toyota es de excelente calidad, hermoso, cómodo. Nunca se daña! Para mi el mejor carro del mundo"
1439, a year ago,5,These cars are excellent on gas and last years for a family car. I don’t like the older styles but the new ones are beautiful
1440, a year ago,5,Este es un vehículo que cuenta con grandes cualidades las cuales se adaptan al pasajero para darle comodidad ergonomía y descanso en el viaje que esté haciendo por lo que llegado a la conclusión de que este vehículo es uno de los mejores tanto en fuerza como en velocidad los colores son llamativos y la forma interna hace que sea agradable a la vista
1441, a year ago,5,"Great vehicle, will take you anywhere, never get stuck! Smooth, comfortable ride, roomy, great way."
1442, a year ago,5,"Super spacious and love the air controls in the back. Having a younger child, 8, allowing her to control the temperature herself is a great tool for a parent."
1443, a year ago,5,"I’ve had my Prius for several years now and can speak to its safety, reliability and ability to be gas efficient. It’s not the sexiest car in terms of physical exterior but I do love how comfortable it is and it’s ability to help me save money on gas - especially for a heavy driver like myself."
1444, a year ago,5,Car looks shorter on the exterior but when driving it looks much higher like truck driving high. Super comfortable for travel and extremely spacious!! You can literally run a business with the trunk of this car
1445, a year ago,5,The design on the outside it seems luxurious than that of the past models. It’s sleek design gives it a more expensive look. The interior is very comfortable good for daily travel and great for longer trips as well
1446, a year ago,5,Toyota Corolla is for the long haul! This car requires little maintenance  and gas to perform well
1447, a year ago,3,I cant tell you much about this car. First and last time i drove a camry was about 13 yrs ago when i was taking driving lessons ! It seemed like the best car in my eyes because i was an 18yr who jist wanted to drive!
1448, a year ago,5,"This car is surprisingly nice and spacious inside. The gas mileage alone is a huge win, especially if you live in California."
1449, a year ago,5,This is such a comfortable car to drive and ride in. It's a really smooth ride. We've been able to drive this car really long distances with no issues. It has built in safety features such as lane assist. It also has a backup camera and when the seatbelt is not done up it has an alarm until you put it on.
1450, a year ago,5,"I thought it was a great built vehicle, it was inexpensive to fill the gas tank, I had no problems with the vehicle at all it’s a great choice for the college student, and others hoping to have reliable vehicle that is safe"
1451, a year ago,5,"I love this car! It’s super reliable and is in it for the long haul. I had a ‘98 Corolla until 2018 with nearly 180,000 miles on it and when I got rid of it had not one part gone that would have cost a great deal to repair it would have been fine."
1452, a year ago,5,This car makes me feel@very safe when I drive it. It’s a bit bigger than the Rav4 but not huge
1453, a year ago,4,I had this car for a few years and it never gave me trouble. Very reliable more@compact car
1454, a year ago,5,I feel very safe in my car because it’s bigger than a Corolla but not extremely large like@a pickup. Toyota’s in general have the best motors and the parts are very affordable
1455, a year ago,5,"Absolutely love my 2017 Toyota 4Runner. She runs great, gas mileage isn't too great, but she really does well on the road. She's good on road trips, plenty of space to hold things and stretch out. Always a smooth ride."
1456, a year ago,4,"The new model year is definitely nice to look at. At first glance I thought it was an Infiniti not a Toyota. The drive is a bit jarring, not too smooth. Seems like it would take some getting used to."
1457,a year ago,5,I love the Corolla I really would like this to become my next car. They are safe and reliable as well!
1458, a year ago,5,I love this van.. It runs great. She sits a little low to the ground but over all a great ride. I would definitely recommend to any one

1460, a year ago,5,"When I graduated from high school my mom gave me her Corolla .... I loved that car ....safe, reliable, fun 🤩"
1461, a year ago,5,"For a small car, a Yaris sure is roomy. I really am impressed with the trunk space of the hatchback. My 6’9” husband can also fit without his head touching the ceiling. I enjoy driving this car and like how it handles. I wish it was AWD, though."
1462, a year ago,5,Great vehicle for larger families in some of the models you can have it seat eight people￼. They’ve been true in the middle is click and lock into place it’s updating easy￼
1463, a year ago,4,"Had a Sienna after my second was born. I had 2 kids in car seats and although it was big, the van made it so much easier to get the kids in and out of the car. We took many long road trips in the van and loved it"
1464, a year ago,5,"Really great commuter car. Good gas mileage, comfortable to drive and ride in. Would purchase again"
1465, a year ago,3,I semi liked this car when I had it. Ended up selling it for cheap because alot was wrong with it and very costly to fix
1466, a year ago,5,"This car was pure class!  Beautiful details, strong, reliable and efficient on gas."
1467, a year ago,4,"My husband drives a Rav4. He really likes it and it has never had any issues. I will say that his seats stain very easily, they are tan and black cloth. "
1468, a year ago,5,"I have a 2019 Toyota Corolla. I LOVE MY BABY.😩 MOST INCREDIBLE AND AFFORDABLE CAR FROM TOYOTA. it saves a lot of gas, has dope interior and exterior. I wouldn’t trade my car for anything."
1469, a year ago,5,"My very first car was a 2004 Toyota Corolla and whenever I upgraded I decided to stay with the Toyota family. My commute to and from work is about an hour each way and I need a car that is reliable. These cars have efficient gas mileage and they are reliable. Any repairs, oil changes, etc are never too expensive like for other brands."
1470, a year ago,5,I’ve always heard you can’t wrong with a Toyota. And they were absolutely right! I love my car and I wouldn’t trade it for anything!!
1471, a year ago,5,Older model but it was so fuel efficient. Fantastic in the snow and where I'm from it tends to snow a lot. The navigation was great. Definitely would recommend.
1472, a year ago,5,"Although, I am not a very discerning car driver, but I’ve had no issues with the car! It works great and has great features. No complaints here!"
1473, a year ago,5,I drove my friends 2010 camry a few times to drive her to appointments and back. I love the smoothness of the ride and the power. The cabin is perfect size although it seems to be a downside on the toyota camry and corollas that when you plug in a device to the lighter outlet the radio goes staticy.
1474, a year ago,5,I have a 2002 toyota corolla I love the gas mileage as $20 fills up my tank and I can almost go all week on it. It's definitely the smallest car I have owned and fragile (I accidently pulled the door handle whilst it was locked and it broke right off.) Other then being fragile it is a great car for long driving or everyday use.
1475, a year ago,5,"I currently own a Nissan Altima, and I adore Nissan vehicles. Not so much the company itself, due to issues in the past. The car runs great but after 12 years we are having stalling problems and electrical problems. Definitely would recommend but make sure to run a full body scan around 10 years or so."
1476, a year ago,5,We love our Toyota Highlander! Nothing more than routine maintenance has been needed since driving off the lot. We will always be a Toyota family.
1477, a year ago,5,I like the way the car rides . One of the first cars I’ve drove . I liked every feature the car had to offer.

1480, a year ago,4,Have a 2017 Tacoma. Nice to have because I use the extended cab specifically for my husky. Good on gas. Wish I was able to get it with all wheel drive. It was a good price love the rear view camera; helps a lot with backing up and making sure I don't hit anything.
1481, a year ago,5,"I’ve had this car since 2017 & it has been such a reliable car. I have had no problems whatsoever (knock on wood). It’s a good mom car as well. I love that it’s not too small, there is a lot of room. Best car I’ve ever had."
1482, a year ago,5,I used it once. Feels pretty good and sturdy. Do like the console. Seats are comfortable and spacious.
1483,a year ago,5,"Great on gas and is a spacious, yet compact, vehicle. My LE version offers leather heated seats, strong radio waves, and a clear dashboard and screen display."
1484,a year ago,4,Absolutely love my corolla I bought a 2020 hatch in the nightshade package. The car has a few little quirks but what doesn’t. Definitely not a very fast car but it can keep up with most other naturally aspirated cars in its class.
1485, a year ago,5,My 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is my favorite car I’ve ever owned! I have owned two other Toyota’s in my life. They are such great cars!
1486, a year ago,5,"I love my mom’s RAV4, super comfortable and spacious, sporty but also luxurious, and the upgrades are fantastic!"
1487, a year ago,5,"I love my Corolla, and it’s wonderful on gas! Plus this car last forever! I’ve never had any major problems; just keep up with the oil changes and you’re good to go! This will for sure be my forever car!"
1488, a year ago,5,"This car is Phenomenal! I got this car in 2018 and it is so smooth on the road. Also, it has lane departure which is very helpful safety wise when traveling as a family. While this isn't a certified smart car, it is very cautious of alerting when at a dangerous proximity for the driver's safety!"
1489, a year ago,5,"Mi corolla es super cómodo fácil de manejar. Tiene buen rendimiento, los mantenimientos son económicos. Amo mi carro"
1490, a year ago,5,"I love my Rav4. I’ve had it for almost 4 years and it is still like new! Extremely reliable, has a user-friendly interface, and looks really nice. Highly recommend Toyota."
1491, a year ago,5,"I love my car. The size of perfect for me, I can fit 5 people very comfortably but it’s not too big to drive."
1492, a year ago,5,okay cars. Very reliable car. Although i would not recommend for a family. Kind of tight with no leg room.
1493,a year ago,4,"The Toyota camry is very nice and sleek, and has all the upgrades you could want but didn't have a leather luxury option, which if I can I will go with luxury option."
1494,a year ago,5,"Used a RAV4 rental to drive from Florida to Louisiana smoothest ride ever, love the Lane assist feature... wish I had one of my own!"
1495, a year ago,5,I love my car. I got it for my 18th birthday/graduation present. It's a great car. I love that it looks feminine. It's good on gas. I wish the interior was a little different color option wise. It's an affordable car. It's great for a first time driver.
1496, a year ago,4,A friend was in a bad accident in a Toyota and she came out with just some scratches. Not only is this vehicle safe but it’s stylish. The inside is a little basic for most newer cars but it does have features like the rear window rolling down and the smart screen. I also like that it has 4 wheel drive for driving in bad weather.
1497, a year ago,5,"I own one and this baby is just perfect for the everyday spree, whether it's picking the kids or for grocery shopping. it's maintenance is low and the Toyota services are far better than any other. Would highly recommend their cars."
1498, a year ago,4,"Die Maschine ist leistungsstark und hatte genug Drehmoment.  Wir befinden uns in einer hügeligen Region und haben festgestellt, dass dies aufgrund seines Komforts und seiner Kilometerleistung eine großartige Fahrt war"
1499, a year ago,5,My current vehicle and I love it! I’ve had other Toyota’s before but this is by far my favorite. I drive all highway miles and get 26-28 mpg.
1500, a year ago,5,"I have owned a few of these and they are well worth their money. They get amazing gas mileage, run forever and only ever required routine maintenance."
1501, a year ago,5,Great gas mileage and reasonably priced. Well built and only ever had to do routine maintenance.
1502, a year ago,5,"Before buying a car, especially in this price range, a little research goes a long way. My choice was between the Toyota Highlander and the Honda Pilot, both top of the line models. The Pilot had an edge because I already own one. After test driving both vehicles at least a couple of times, I found that the safety features on the Toyota Highlander were better than those on the Honda Pilot. With the Pilot, I found that I had to purchase features such as a video system in order to get the lane shift feature I really wanted. I love the Highlander, which surprised me since I've really enjoyed my 2012 Pilot. The Highlander rides like a luxury vehicle. In comparing both 2018 models, the Highlander was a more luxurious, comfortable, feature laden car."
1503, a year ago,5,I personally owned a 4Runner. It was reliable and low maintenance for the duration of my ownership. The ride was a bit rugged but tolerable. MPG was very good.  I would say that it is a very reasonably priced auto for what it offers. I would highly recommend this product.
1504, a year ago,4,"I’m not a sedan person, otherwise this would be 5 stars, but this car is great. I’ve heard good things about mileage and I appreciate that you can go further than an suv. The inside of these cars is also always nice."
1505, a year ago,1,Plastic. Would not drive this car again. I rented this car and I hated how small it was.
1506, a year ago,5,"Gets great mileage with gas, sleek, updated, sportier look. Comfortable interior. Easy maneuverability and smooth ride. Good safety features. Great customer service."
1507, a year ago,5,"I bought my Corolla in 2006, and I still drive it to this day.  I have never had any major issues, and it has been a very reliable car.   The gas mileage is amazing, and the interior has held up great."
1508, a year ago,5,"This vehicle has so much room, and it is comfortable.  I previously owned a Corolla I had for 13 years, and I needed more room after having a little one.  We upgraded to the Highlander, and I would highly recommend it to everyone."
1509, a year ago,5,This is a great car would definitely repurchase. Has lots of get up and go and is a great running car
1510, a year ago,5,I had a 4Runner for 10 years and it was one of my favorite vehicles. I’d 100% buy another one.
1511,a year ago,4,i have a 2020 rav4 and i enjoy it.  it has good pick up and is good when the weather is poor.  i do wish it was a little bit bigger but the seating space in the back is decent and i have had adults back there with plenty of leg room.  the trunk space is good as well.  i like that there is an eco gas feature to try to help with gas savings.  
1512, a year ago,5,Great car. Very efficient. Runs great gas wise. Perfect for a commuter. Only thing I would say negatively is that the parts don’t feel high quality like in older models but I think that is with a lot of new cars now.
1513, a year ago,5,Very spacious. Nice sized SUV. Very comfortable and has great features. Very smooth drive. I think this is an overall great car!
1514, a year ago,5,"I love my Rav4, it has lots of room in it, its easy to get in and out of, I like how it drives. If I buy another it would be the Rav4"
1515, a year ago,3,"It's a good car, I just find it hard to get in and out of . It's not bad on gas, It was giving to us, not sure if I would go out and buy one"
1516, a year ago,4,Very good car my mom bought hers about two years ago and it’s running good still and although it looks small its pretty good with space too and has an Aux input for your phone. Although its not for snow its also pretty good in it.
1517,a year ago,4,"i love my car, it works well and drives comfortably.  although my car is relatively new (less than 5 years old), i wish it had the blind side alerts, but that’s just me. overall though, i would recommend this car, it’s a good size, gets pretty good mileage, is comfortable, and works well"
1518, a year ago,5,My first new car was a Toyota Camry with all the bells and whistles. By far Toyota is the best on the market. I would highly recommend Toyota vehicles before any other.
1519,a year ago,4,Nice car it goes fast and my friend has it I’m pretty sure it’s a solid car and has nice interior
1520,a year ago,4,Nice reliable car my friend has it and it goes fast and also is safe and nice interior
1521, a year ago,5,"I love my toyota highlander, I love how comfortable my family fits in it with out having to have a van. My favorite thing about my highlander is the pull up sun shades, I know it's a small thing but with kids it's a life saver!! My highlander is a 2014 and I still love it!!"
1522, a year ago,5,"We got the hybrid and it’s so nice a smooth, I love the inside of the car, leather seats make it comfortable to sit in. It has a wireless phone charger!! That’s the selling point for me. We also have a growing family and having a 7 seater car is a must!"
1523, a year ago,5,"This was my first car - it’s a great, dependable and safe vehicle. It’s great on gas as well."
1524, a year ago,5,"My husband is on his second Prerunner (here’s had it for 8 years now, his first one he had for 10 years). I love how dependable this truck is. It’s a great truck for moving - small furniture, boxes, etc."
1525, a year ago,5,"I adore my RAV4 - best purchase ever! It’s the perfect size vehicle for my family, grocery shopping, etc. It’s pretty good on gas as well."
1526, a year ago,5,"Good car, hardly any problems with it. Really not good in the snow because it sits too low."
1527, a year ago,4,"I have always liked the look of the FJ Cruiser. They don’t really make newer models and I prefer vehicles with third row. But overall, love them snd love the look."
1528, a year ago,5,"Honestly love this car so much!! I have been driving a Toyota RAV4 since 2019. Personally, for me being short, I love that you can adjust the steering wheel and the seat to be higher or lower depending on your preference."
1529, a year ago,5,This car is fast and it doesn’t take up a lot of parking space which is something that I like
1530, a year ago,4,I believe Toyota Cars are very easy to drive and are very save. There are many futures on how to save gas while you have stopped on a red light. I believe they can improve their rechecks on cars because this was the second time I purchased a car and in the first 2 weeks I had started having problems with the front and back cameras  
1531, a year ago,4,Toyota Corollas are great cars. They are very easy to drive and have a lot of space in the car/trunk for many uses. I do not own a Toyota Corolla but I have heard they they are another very useful and reliable cars to get for families or individuals who need their first car. 
1532, a year ago,4,The car is very comfortable. I have been a passenger and find the back seat and front seat to be comfortable for long drives. I have also driven the vehicle for short drives and thinks it handles well. Long lasting cars.
1533, a year ago,4,"Not bad. Good om gas. I owned a toyota before and it was the best car i ever had , never had any issues besides the normal wear and tear ( breaks ) .. was a great car"
1534, a year ago,5,My toyota scion was amazing!  We loved ours!  Mostly my husband drove because he always claimed the fastest car .. lol. ;P
1535, a year ago,5,Great car fun to drive and ride in could have a little more room in the back seat other than that I like it....trunk space is good I did find the charger ports aren't that great but other than minor things like that it's a great car and being someone who likes to be as comfortable in their ride as they are at home I should know 
1536, a year ago,5,I was gifted this car when my parents could no longer drive its 1997 model and more of a toy than anything it has probably 300 thousand miles on it and besides the seats being a little torn up from wear and tear I can get in it and it drives like a brand new car everything still works like new great ac/heat and more than anything it's really fun to drive
1537, a year ago,4,"Very nice car. I don’t currently have one but I did drive one for a while a couple years back (Red) and I can say that it’s a sturdy car and pretty fast. I took mine all the way to Oklahoma and back to Texas within a day, and the ride was very smooth."
1538, a year ago,4,"Pretty good drive. Felt smooth, not much bad to say about it. Only reason it gets 4 stars is that it’s a little big for my preference and makes parking difficult"
1539, a year ago,5,"I’ve driven a Toyota Rav4 for 5 years now & have absolutely zero complaints. Such a reliable car, beautifully designed, and drives smoothly. It’s affordable & I recommend it to all my friends looking to buy a car!"
1540,a year ago,4,I like the space in this car .. the infotainment system is easy to use and love the sound.
1541,a year ago,5,We loved our FJ so much!! Such a great SUV.  Love the space in it.  They last forever.
1542,a year ago,5,These babies last forever!!! They hold their value super well and are such a great buy.  My favorite SUV of all time.
1543, a year ago,4,Great car very economic! Gas is never too expensive for this car and generally last. Never had any major problems with this car and is super cute and comfortable. No complaints.
1544, a year ago,3,It was not my car but I loved the interior and all the amenities it comes with. Can’t give a lot of information on it
1545, a year ago,5,"I owned a Camry for years and it was dependable, nice and never had issues. Would definitely buy again"
1546, a year ago,4,Pretty speedy for a smaller car! It is priced appropriately and is perfect for college students!
1547, a year ago,5,"Even though my car is from over ten years ago, it is still running perfectly. The biggest perk of the Corolla is the gas mileage, this is a big deal when you have a long commute like I do. Parts are cheap and easily found if needed. "
1548, a year ago,5,You have to love toyota! This car for us has been the best thing that happened! Having a great reliable car for the family I find it super affordable for the type of car although our family outgrown it is still our daily car! Highly recommend Toyota to anyone.
1549,a year ago,5,"La voiture familial parfaite.
Niveau sécurité, elle est très bien équipé, et ça dès l'entrée de gamme.
Ne vous attendait pas à une conduite : ""on roule comme des cons"" mais à une voiture moderne avec des aides à la conduite faites pour garantir un voyage confortable en toute sécurité.
La consommation est faible et ses 122ch donne une bonne accélération.
La tenue de route est excellente"
1550, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love the Toyota Camry!! This was the first new car that I owned New !! Best decision I ever made . I had this car for about 10 yrs until a n unfortunate accident and never had an issue with it. It had almost 200,000 miles on no repairs ever made only matieneced it oil change ,tires,wipers& brakes..best car I have ever owned definitely will purchase another one soon!!!"
1551, a year ago,5,"Un carro súper económico, casi nunca falla y es súper.comodo para personas que necesitan movilizarse dentro del are de ciudad"
1552, a year ago,3,Honestly a pretty reliable car. There’s not much that’s special about it but if I’m looking for a car that will last this is always a go to.
1553,a year ago,5,I'm in love with my 2020 toyota camry! It has more features than I could imagine. I even have the beautiful red interior and it drives smooth
1554, a year ago,5,So my mom owns a Prius and it is a little bada**! It really gets on it and goes. It's also very comfortable to drive and also a lot of fun. My sister and I got a speeding ticket last time we borrowed it to make a trip. I would definitely recommend everyone buy a Prius!
1555, a year ago,3,My mom owns one so as a back seat passenger its not that comfortable and kinda small. It does drive really smooth and quiet and the drivers seat is pretty comfortable.
1556,a year ago,5,Super cute cars. I drove one from TN to Vegas. Very reliable. No issues what so ever. Perfect family car or an every day car. Great power. A lot of room. I loved this car.
1557, a year ago,5,I had one of these along time ago and it was great. Always ran perfect and we never had problems. Went all the way to almost 400 thousand miles and sold it and that person still has. Id recommend and great family ride.
1558, a year ago,2,I know a few people who have had these and had quite a few problems. One of my friends had hers hit by someome driving only 25 mph and it destroyed and totalled it. So i wouldn't recommend them. She paid a lot for it as well.
1559, a year ago,5,"Best car, so comfortable and great on gas, sleek body style. No cons come to mind when I think of my 2019 se Camry"
1560, a year ago,2,"I wanted to love the Yaris. Unfortunately I was just not impressed. It is very small, so at least it's great on gas. The heat and AC were very weak. After only a year, it started to get this really terrible smell that we could never locate the source of. Turns out many others had this same issue. We ended up trading it in for a Corolla and were much much happier."
1561, a year ago,5,"I was really happy with my Corollas! The only thing better was the Camry. Very good on gas. A decent amount of room, though a little cramped for my 6ft+ significant other. I don't know that I would say there was anything extra special about these particular models, but they are a very reliable, affordable vehicle."
1562, a year ago,5,Muy buen carro muy amplio y bueno para manejar en fuera de la cuidad es un carro donde puedes llevar a toda tu familia perfectamente
1563, a year ago,5,"This is my baby, very first car and I love it. It’s sport, save gas, is not that expensive and works really good."
1564, a year ago,5,This is a great suv. Super comfortable and nice. The radio sounds good and save gas.
1565, a year ago,2,"Didn’t like it. Although is cheap and works fine, it could be better. It’s not for me"

1567,a year ago,4,Elle ne tombe pas en panne facilement elle conduit très bien et cela fais plusieurs années que je l’ai
1568, a year ago,4,Great car. Very reliable. The new body shape is gorgeous and even looks a tad sporty.
1569, a year ago,5,My husband owns this car and I personally love it. Great energy efficiency which is a must since he drives an hour one way to work. I like the trunk of the car as it has a privacy curtain to cover the contents. This is great since he lives in the city and can leave a bag in the car that’s out of sight to passerby’s.
1570, a year ago,5,I safe a lot of money on gas and fits everyone because of the size love my car. I will buy another Yaris when the times comes
1571, a year ago,5,I had a Toyota Sienna until january 2020. After 5 years i hear a noise and after the dealer work in that the noise still in it. We never know what happened and i decide change my car.
1572, a year ago,5,"I have a 2020 Corolla and is so economic, less than 28 dollars for two weeks milllage is so good. The air conditioning is very good."
1573, a year ago,5,No puedo decir como es la experiencia manejando este carro por que yo no se manejar. Y tampoco se como es en el motor y las necesidades que se tienen cuando tienes un carro. pero como pasajera puedo decir que a simple vista el carro es muy hermoso y cuando entras en el tiene unos sillónes muy amplios y tiene una conformidad muy buena. Lo que más me gusta es que tiene una pantalla para ver cuando te estás estacionando y haci evitar chocar con algo 
1574, a year ago,5,"Love the highlander, so happy with this purchase! Can’t beat Toyota! Such a smooth ride."
1575,a year ago,5,A work of art and a workhorse combined!! Super car! Reliable and cost efficient! Highly recommended!
1576, a year ago,5,"Can’t go wrong with aToyota, this one was so smooth - once I had one tire explode while going 70 mph and although I heard it, I didn’t feel it, the car didn’t move."
1577, a year ago,5,"Very reliable car, lasted 10 years and 3 accidents until the last one totaled it, otherwise I would still be driving it."
1578, a year ago,5,Amazing car keep up maintenance and the car will run forever my cousin has owned two and my aunt bought a brand new one and they all run great and smooth also cheap on gas and up keep I highly recommend camrys
1579, a year ago,5,Drives great the smooth is smooth. The newer ones have separate heat and air conditioning adjuster for driver and passenger. Very roomy great family car.
1580, a year ago,5,The Toyota Sequoia is such a nice car and is great if you have a family. I love the way the back window rolls down. It’s pricey but very nice.
1581, a year ago,4,This car is a nice alternative to the 4Runner if you are looking for a Toyota but I felt it was too low to the ground and I didn’t like how it handled.
1582, a year ago,5,I love my 4Runner. I live in a snowy area where it’s winter the majority of the year and I feel so safe driving. It handles well in all conditions and I like how high it sits off the ground. It doesn’t get great gas mileage but what it lacks in that aspect it makes up for in performance and reliability.
1583,a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota Camry! Toyota is such a highly recommended and trusted car brand. Their prices are affordable and their finance team is excellent. When I got this car, it was without a doubt in my mind that I was leaving the dealership knowing that I had made the right decision and a great investment. "
1584, a year ago,4,"I loved the size, very good on gas. The inside was spacious. There was never any mechanical issues and nothing to fix. My only problem was that I was getting stuck everywhere in the winter time."
1585, a year ago,5,Love this car!! The price for them is great!! They never break down and the depreciation rate is extremely good!! The power on them is okay but how fast are you trying to go anyways? Would recommend to all ages!
1586,a year ago,4,"I absolutely love my 4 Runner.  I feel safe and that my children are safe when we are in it.  My not so favorite things are the gas mileage and the fact that there is little to no air that reaches the third row. Other than those things, I would be happy with purchasing another one!"
1587, a year ago,5,We have a 2017 model year Toyota Highlander. I am a stay at home mom so mainly have used the car for just around town. Lately we took the car for a long road trip which was very comfortable for the whole family. I would recommend this car for either.
1588,a year ago,4,So powerful and fuel efficient! The back seat is kinda tight. But I love the styling of the car. Standard LED lights are a wonderful and surprising addition. The engine and transmission make the car like a rocket even with the base engine
1589, a year ago,2,Don't like this car one bit Toyota has this SUV and it's really uncomfortable to be sitting in the back. It's really small and the camera of the on I was a passenger in was super small located on the rearview mirror. I wouldn't purchase a Toyota car.
1590,a year ago,5,I have a 2018 SR5. Absolutely love it. It’s big enough for road trips and camping yet not overly big where I can park it easily downtown. Also great vehicle for off-roading.
1591, a year ago,5,LOVE my Camry!!!! So comfortable for the whole family. The only thing that drives me crazy is when the rear windows are down there is a loud whapping noise. Thank goodness the ac works great so it is not usually a problem.
1592, a year ago,5,I’ve owned a Camry years ago and it was a great start up car. Loved the trunk space and how spacious the backseat was as well.
1593, a year ago,5,I just purchased my new Highlander in July and can’t be any happier! I love all the features and it rides so smoothly.
1594, a year ago,5,Great car my lady car was 2005 with 415k and finally for in December 2020. This is a great brand car and I really love it
1595,a year ago,3,"A great starter car! Great on gas and very reliable. A bit on the compact side so if you plan on having more than 2 people in the vehicle I would suggest a different vehicle. If you take care of them, these cars last for ever though, mine is 2007 with almost 470,000 miles on the original motor and it's still going strong."
1596, a year ago,5,Comfortable and nice and big but it consumes too much gasoline but it has a lot of space for the family
1597, a year ago,5,Good car I like it a lot of space and beautiful design consumes too much gasoline that’s a cons
1598, a year ago,5,"White body, black roof and red interior sound and look so sexy. It’s a very sweet ride I should tell you. After riding in one , I want to own one of my own. There are many cool features that you will impressed by."
1599, a year ago,4,"Is really very good car, looks good and nice. Economic in gas and parts. I’m absolutely improving this car"
1600, a year ago,4,"Nice little car. I like that it's a hybrid. Had this for a work car and l switched jobs a few months after being it, so didn't have it too long. Very nice, but not too good in the snow."
1601, a year ago,4,My first car that I didn't share. Had this for a number of years. A very excellent car built to last. Retains it's value for years.
1602, a year ago,5,"I've owned a couple toyota vehicles and they last forever! Great gas mileage too!! They were both pretty owned! My camry eventually unfortunately blew a head gasket! Now I drive an old Avalon with 200,000 miles that is still going strong and in good condition!"
1603, a year ago,3,la verdad a un comienzo me gustaba pero tiene cosas que la verdad no me gusta del todo execelente motor eso si
1604, a year ago,5,la verdad para ser sincera es uno de mis autos preferidos no se pero me parece muy comodo espacioso no amerita tanto gastos de los necesario 
1605, a year ago,5,la verdad me gusto un poco es comodo pero no ha sido de mis autos preferidos hay algunos detalles que no me ha gustado del todo
1606, a year ago,5,This is a good car not to many problems. The car is modern. The pro the car will keep running even past 299999 miles on the odonmintor.
1607, a year ago,2,"I can truly say I cannot stand my 2017 Toyota Highlander XLE. It has the most ancient ""car play"" system, it looks like it's from 2010. After driving 4,000 miles in it (I got it used from a Toyota dealership), the battery started dying, I needed new breaks, and the bluetooth completely quit working. I cannot wait to trade this piece of junk in. "
1608, a year ago,5,"My brother’s 1982 Toyota Celica was the car I taught myself how to drive a stick shift in. My Daddy use to let me change gears when I was only 2 years old, so I knew how to do that part already, but I taught myself the clutch coordination in my brother’s car when I was 12. I had the cool brother who would let me sneak his car behind my Mom’s back. My Dad died when I was 9 so I didn’t have him to teach me how to do the clutch so what do you do when you want something done right? You do it yourself and that’s what I did. This Celica was such a good car! When I got of age and it was time to get my license, my brother had given me this car as he was away at sea in the Navy and since it was the car I learned to drive a stick shift in, it was uber familiar to me. I enjoyed the smoothness of the ride and the dependability of the car. It never gave me any trouble. Toyotas have always been stellar cars. Their caliber of a vehicle was topnotch then just as it is today. "
1609, a year ago,5,Loved the FJ Cruiser. My husband had one a few years ago. It’s very spacious. Great for outdoor activities and also driving around the city. It’s affordable and loved that it took regular gas. Would recommend.
1610, a year ago,5,"This was my favorite car, but it didn’t fit my whole family so I had to buy a bigger vehicle. This car gets excellent gas mileage."
1611, a year ago,5,This is a great family car! It gets really good gas mileage if your traveling somewhere. Very comfortable as well. Not much to improve on this.
1612, a year ago,5,Kind a Toyota RAV4 is a very comfortable very easy fun vehicle to drive with it’s either gas or hybrid version either way you can’t go wrong the hybrid sounds like an alien spaceship which is fun and gets a lot of head turns
1613,a year ago,5,I’ve never had major issues. I appreciate the reliability of my car. Over all maintenance is affordable. Great value for the price. These cars last a lifetime and are well worth it. I recommend Toyota and will repurchase.
1614, a year ago,5,This is such a good car! It’s easy to drive so it’s good for new drivers. It’s not too bad on gas and has enough room. I do sometimes wish I had more space though. I love the Toyota Corolla!
1615, a year ago,4,"Very affordable gas! It is a hybrid, very great for road trips! Doesn’t look super cool but saves me and my boyfriend lots of money is very convenient, easy to learn how to drive! ☺️"
1616, a year ago,3,"Excellent safety scores, efficient four-cylinder and hybrid options, and strong available V-6, it has sloppy handling and an accord is leagues better in every regard"
1617, a year ago,4,Great on gas and the safety rating is very good if that is something you consider when buying a vehicle. The base model has all your needs. The price is pretty average but well worth it considering it holds its value.
1618, a year ago,5,"In all honesty, this car lives up to Toyota's reputation of reliability. It hasn't broken down once in the years I've owned it. The only problems I have are that at some places, the interior material feels a bit cheap however, that is to be expected considering its price. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable compact SUV."
1619, a year ago,5,I have quite a few miles on this baby and it is still going! Great car to maintain. The low gas prices are honestly a reason alone to get this car. It may not be the coolest but I promise you- this will be the road trip car for the rest of all time.
1620, a year ago,5,"I had a 2006 Toyota Avalon. I miss my car so much! As soon as I can get another car, I'm going to try to get another one. It's basically a luxury car with a more affordable price. And because it's a Toyota, it'll last forever. My other car didn't even die or breakdown on me. It was stolen. I'd be even happier if it was recovered but I'm losing hope it'll be found."
1621, a year ago,3,"The car itself ram great, the majority of the features were cool. My issue which may have been more on the dealer but it's a faulty part of the car to me, is apparently there is some type of hybrid switch under the back seat. Apparently the switch is right under my daughter's car seat and her foot hit it. I didn't know this switch existed but when pressed the car doesn't run. I went through days of issues to find out about this stupid switch. The car was traded in"
1622, a year ago,4,Love this car. Good for all weather driving. I always feel safer in a 4 wheel drive car during the winter. Plenty of room for passengers and cargo.
1623, a year ago,5,"Ive been driving my toyota sienna for almost 7 years. All i can say is i love it sooooooo much. The space, the engine, the style of the van everything that i need in a van it has it. I have 3 kids and this van is so convient. I even use this one for moving very useful and if i will be buying a new van i will definitely stick with toyota sienna"
1624, a year ago,5,I enjoy this car. I have a 2011 and it runs well still and minimal work has had to be out into this car. It runs well and is gas efficient. I do wish it had a larger gas tank. It’s affordable too!
1625,a year ago,5,"Amo el color de sus autos ,el diseño nada que ver a las otras marcas,su color brilloso intenso y claros,su velocidad a la que viaja y sus aguante para todos tus viajes los hace mejores"
1626, a year ago,5,I’ve had my Toyota Yaris since I’m 16 so in total 8 years! I love it. It’s tiny so parking is a breeze. The only downside is that it only has two doors so getting the kiddo in and out can be quite a hassle
1627, a year ago,5,"I love my Corolla!  My dad handed it down to me when I was in need and I would never go back.  My Corolla has over 260,000 miles on it and is still going strong.  Never broken down on me and never left me stranded.  I would definitely recommend!"
1628, a year ago,5,in love with my purple Rav4. I have only ever driven Toyota and I TRUST THIS BRAND WITH MY ACTUAL LIFE. I have seen my dad first hand get into an accident tat should've been a lot worse but his toyota saved him. The bigger steering wheel is one of my favorite features 
1629, a year ago,5,"Súper cómoda , con unos asientos de piel espectacular, la línea de carro me encanta ya que su diseño es muy sofisticado , con un precio bajo para todo lo que nos ofrece , muy amplia por dentro , por lo que la recomiendo ampliamente!🤗"
1630,a year ago,5,"bueno El SUV mediano más resistente de la marca japonesa, el Toyota 4Runner, recibe en su modelo 2020 un equipamiento más completo que incluye un nuevo Pickup con esencia 4x4, que cuenta con un diseño robusto y musculoso; nada parece detenerlo.I highly recommend it"
1631, a year ago,5,"This is a very reliable and safe car. It gets decent gas mileage, but not as good as our Prius. It has a lot of space for both passengers and storage. There’s a lot more usable truck space than most sedans."
1632, a year ago,5,"The Prius is the best and most reliable car I’ve ever had. It runs completely smoothly after 15 years of owning it. I’m about ready to replace it with a new car, and I’m hoping it will be another Prius. It’s safe, smooth, and gets amazing gas mileage."
1633, a year ago,3,Takes too long for the AC and heat to run. Happened with every Toyota my dad had. Everything else about the car is fine.
1634, a year ago,4,"I like the way it drives but doesn't have enough room when using the 3rd row seating, I need more room for next car for sure"
1635, a year ago,5,I have a 2018 Camry and must say this is the most comfortable and reliable car I have ever owned. I'm excited about the 2021 model.
1636, a year ago,5,It’s absolutely beautiful inside and out. Love how it’s for off reading as well but still looks so sleek.
1637, a year ago,5,"This is the most reliable car ever. I love how smooth it drives. I also love how spacious it is. It gets me to point A to point B in no problem. There’s two features, eco mode and sports mode. Overall, I would recommend a Toyota Corolla to anyone!"
1638, a year ago,5,"The newer versions are quite lovely! Spacious and quite the pep@for the price. I wouldn’t say great family car as the trunk@space is quite small, unless you have only 1 child."
1639, a year ago,5,I have a 2007 Toyota camry and i love it. One of the best cars i have ever had. I would definitely recommend to a relative or friend.
1640, a year ago,4,"The body has been developing a sleeker and slightly more aggressive look over the years, which I like. The features on the luxury models are very high tech and tempting to splurge for. I do wish it had more acceleration power, and I believe the line runs too expensive compared to its competitors."
1641, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota Corolla LE Eco Plus. It has a sleek look and the pearl white has a beautiful shimmer. It drives smooth and gets great mileage. It was also a great deal. I'll be driving it for years to come and I highly recommend it!
1642, a year ago,5,"Love my Toyota's! All of them all my life! Best car.. Never had a problem. Do your regukar maintenance, give it new tires and keep up with your motor and you have a car for life!"
1643, a year ago,4,I really enjoy driving a Rav4. Drives smoothly and does well on gas. Feels very safe for my two children to be in their car seats in the back as well. Lots of room in the trunk too.
1644, a year ago,5,"I loved my Toyota Camry!! Unfortunately I was trapped into a lease and ended up parting ways with it rather than purchasing to get out of the negative situation. However, I would purchase this vehicle down the road! Drives smooth, very nice feel for a fair price."
1645, a year ago,5,"I experienced riding in a 2011 Toyota Camry.  It was really nice, smooth riding.  This particular model had a soundproof interior, I truly couldn’t hear any typical noises from the outside as we rode.  I would highly recommend this make & model."
1646, a year ago,5,"El carro es de lo mejor que he adquirido , es Yam confortable para cuando viajas lejos , con unos asientos estupendamente cómodos , la camioneta está dentro del precio para todo lo que te ofrece tanto en tecnología como en comodidad, realmente es uno de mis carros preferidos , súper recomendado! 👏🏼👏🏼🤗"
1647,a year ago,4,Personnellement j ai ce n'est pas ma voiture a moi mais pour ce qui est de confort je vous assure que vous le trouverai et pour ce qui est de la chaleur est arrivé très vite. Je l'a trouve vraiment mignonne. Si jous chercher une voiture je l'as trouve sympathique
1648, a year ago,5,"One of my favorite cars! Easy to drive, comfortable for long trips, lots of fun features and a smooth ride. As long as you do regular upkeep/maintenance, this car will last forever!"
1649, a year ago,5,"I’ve owned this car before.  Probably one of the most reliable cars I’ve ever owned.  Never had it in the shop for anything except oil changes and regular maintenance.  It’s safe, reliable, fun to drive and can come in more traditional sedan (family) looks or sportier versions!"
1650, a year ago,5,My husband has this car I drive it once in a while I like it very much.￼ He loves it to
1651, a year ago,4,Love my Toyota. It’s reliable and never let me down. My only complaint is having cloth seats but that is my fault. Lol!! It rides smooth and is very quiet when it is on. I love it so much my next vehicle will be a Toyota.
1652, a year ago,5,I love love love the gas mileage and the dependability of prius. It's like driving a videogame and trying to get the high score of mpg!
1653, a year ago,5,I love my Camry. This is actually my second one. It is the perfect car with enough space and goes well in the snow.
1654, a year ago,5,"Very good gas mileage, a little tight on space to fit 5 adults in but it works good. Takes me where I need to get."
1655, a year ago,5,Rented this last year. Really liked it and considering buying - good power and gas mileage.
1656, a year ago,5,"I had a Four Runner used and I must say it's definitely my favorite car I ever had. I have had brand new cars, sporty cars, trendy hybrids but as far as a fun car my Four Runner was fun and tough looking as well , it had great big tires and a brush bar across the grill. It had 200 thousand +miles when I got it babe had over 300 when I sold it. I ended up having to sale it cause it was hard on gas and at the time gas prices were record highs. So if they could make the 6 cylinder a little better on gas it would be perfect."
1657, a year ago,4,Best gas mileage around. This was my childhood family car and it lasted 16 years ! The newer models are really good looking too. Somewhat affordable and saves lots of gas money
1658,a year ago,5,Our Corolla has been in the family for a decade now and it’s the most reliable car I’ve ever had. It’s seen it all and it’s a definite keeper for our family!
1659,a year ago,5,Obsessed with my Camry! Great family sedan and so comfortable! So reliable. The trunk space is great and the hybrid gets great gas mileage !
1660, a year ago,5,"Great car!! Runs great, comfortable easy to drive. Lots of room for four adults. Backseats fold down for extra room when moving boxes, small pieces of furniture or stopping at the home improvement store. Great gas mileage too!"
1661, a year ago,5,I purchased this car when I had my first child because of the convenience of it being a 4 door. It has adequate trunk space. This car is affordable.  Toyota vehicles last an extremely long time so I would definitely recommend this car!
1662, a year ago,3,"Not my personal vehicle for comfort but I am a long time SUV girl.  Long to ground so challenging for elderly to get in and out of.  Toyota certainly built to last though, so trade in value great.  Not my pick but may work for your needs"
1663, a year ago,5,"We are a family of five. We were in search of a ride to comfortably fit us all. We can pack in bikes and camping gear. Reliable ride, very little road noise. Love our family mobile!!"
1664, a year ago,5,I used this as a rental car after I was in a bad car accident and I loved it! So easy to drive and great gas mileage. I’m a Chevy girl but would happily drive this car
1665,a year ago,5,The Camry is a very well built car. Toyota has done a great job of creating a luxurious roomy small to medium vehicle that is great on gas. And it's built to last.
1666,a year ago,5,"Amazing SUV! The 4-Runner is luxurious, very roomy, has lots of space, plus a 4x4! Everything you need in an SUV. This is literally my dream car!"
1667, a year ago,5,I love the fj. Safe reliable and powerful with lots of room to enjoy with a luxury feel. I love Toyota company because their cars last extensively. I feel its affordable for its class. I would definitely  recommend this car to anyone looking for reliable safe vehicles.
1668, a year ago,5,Roomy! Was my first car and I loved it. Was a bit too big for me but it was great because I always had room for all of my friends. Recommend.
1669, a year ago,5,"Convenient and reliable. Super handy when driving through busy, tight roads.  Speeds up quickly. Wish I had more room@on the inside but can’t complain too much."
1670, a year ago,5,"Love my 4runner! I traded in a Jeep Wrangler for my 4runner 3 years ago and it was the best decision I made. The 4runner is fuel efficient but still an SUV. The only con is that it can only fit 2 car seats so if you are looking for a big family car, sadly this is not it. A fantastic feature is the back hatch window rolls down...who cares about that?!, you do especially with how much it gets used! Recommend for sure!"
1671, a year ago,5,"This is a great car that will never die, it just keeps going and going and going! I have one with 110000 miles on it and it still looks brand new."
1672, a year ago,4,I have been just a passenger on this car so I don’t know how it is to drive it but I can say it is comfortable also for long travels
1673, a year ago,5,"I love the Toyota Rav 4. The comfort, ease, and overall style are what inspired me to purchase the Toyota Rav 4. Not to mention, it's big enough to transport my teenagers and all their friends! This is not my first Toyota and I can guarantee it won't be my last."
1674,a year ago,4,"Good service all the time 
The motor is great the heat is good and you drive great in it have a car already 5years and still good working"
1675,a year ago,5,Buen coche última tecnología coche híbrido en carretera tiene una respuesta muy buena aunque el consumo no es demasiado bajo
1676, a year ago,3,"It’s reliable but ugly. Good gas mileage, good for young people because it’s pretty low maintenance. If you put down back sits you can fit a lot of stuff in there. It’s not ideal for driving in extreme conditions"
1677, a year ago,4,Smooth ride and comfortable to sit in.  The interior was nice. I enjoyed being a passenger in this car.
1678, a year ago,5,I love my car I really do. I have never had a major problem with my car. I love that I feel safe whenever I get into my car which I think is really important. I would say that it also gets pretty good gas mileage. This is a really good car and I would recommend to any 1st time car buyers.
1679, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota RAV4 hybrid. It gets amazing gas mileage around town and has lasted for many years and I hope many more to come!

1681,a year ago,5,Is so nice car I love all Toyota cars is the best in all have long life and the parts is most easy to find
1682, a year ago,5,I think this is a good car. I have an older model so it does not have a lot of the newer features.
1683, a year ago,5,"I’ve had three of these vehicles! I love this SUV! Has a lot of room inside, plenty of trunk space! Amazing on gas . Surprisingly durable!! Dependable as you will ever get in a car! I love."
1684,a year ago,5,Un auto de gama alta  para cualquier terrenoluboso espacioso par toda la familia es muy hermoso me encanta su estlilo
1685, a year ago,5,"this is a great car and i wish i could have this as my current car, it’s super sleek and great on mileage! the interior is really nice also, i would definitely recommend this car for any new driver or long term really :)"
1686, a year ago,4,"15 Scion tC
Cool little car that gets me from point a to point b. It’s quick enough to be a little sporty with the right hands on the wheel. Paddle shifters 6-speed and/or automatic."
1687, a year ago,4,I used to love my car. It's getting old and pretty beat up now. Great little car though. It's 10 now. I have never had to put it in the shop. 
1688, a year ago,5,My 1980 toyota Corolla was a champ! It was my first car and it was a manual! That car seriously lasted forever. I would nothing more then to get another one.  Newer though
1689, a year ago,4,Just as a passenger but I love the environmentally friendly message of this car and the ride was pretty smooth.
1690, a year ago,4,I’m not the biggest fan of Toyota in general but honestly it’s a VERY reliable brand. My mom had one forever and it was great. A bit old school looking for my taste but this was a few years back. I’m sure the newer models are much more aesthetically pleasing.
1691, a year ago,5,"Así la quiero pero azul y si viene con chofer mejor porque no me gusta manejar, quiero ir a recorrer Venezuela cuando sea libre, enseñarle a mi nieto cada rincón de este país en esta camioneta💕"
1692, a year ago,5,I love this car. It’s affordable and repair parts are affordable also. Saves gas and there’s so much room inside.
1693, a year ago,5,"It’s a really big car, feels great when driving, the back seats are very roomy but take some time to get used to"
1694, a year ago,5,"Pretty good car! Feels heavy when driving which is a good thing for me, doesn’t use a lot of gas"
1695, a year ago,3,"I love driving! In a Toyota Camry? Meh. It’s average in most ways and gets the job done. But is it fun to drive? Acceleration is slow from a stop and the ride is cushy but not engaging. Inside materials seem cheap. Not my choice, but a practical choice for millions of people."
1696,a year ago,4,Pues me gustó la verdad no la eh usado mucho máximo unas dos veces pero me gustó mucho la verdad no me arrepiento de usarla
1697, a year ago,4,"My first car was a 2001 Toyota Camry. It was bought used from a family friend. I drove it for 3.5 years. It was reliable on the road, affordable with purchase and with mileage. Everyone has told me this car is very reliable."
1698, a year ago,5,Toyota Camry  is a very safe an durable car. I truly enjoy the low cost maintenance an reliability of the Toyota Camry . The heated seats an sleek textured leather make the Toyota Camry  very comfortable for long rides. ￼￼The Toyota Camry  gas mileage is beyond any car I have driven previously with needing to only fill the tank once a week makes  the Toyota Camry  a low cost an affordable transportation vehicle. Toyota Camry  ￼
1699, a year ago,5,I have a 2008 and it still runs great. It’s a very dependable car that I trust to get me where I need to go.
1700, a year ago,5,"Good running,  long lasting,  fuel efficient, trustworthy, reliable, low maintaince, sturdy,  dependable"
1701, a year ago,3,"I have the Toyota Hybrid Rav4 XSE 2020 and its two-tone blizzard pearl body and midnight black roof design looks ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. It drives really smooth and saves so much gas compared to my previous Acura TL 2007. I only get gas ~1/month!! Since we’ve been avoiding eating out due to COVID, I’ve really enjoyed placing down the back row of seats to expand the trunk into a little picnic area, I’ll include a photo (also disclaimer: my gf and I are both 5’2 girls so it might be tighter for taller ppl). I’m only giving it 3 out of 5 stars though bc I find it weird the LE and XLE both have power folding side mirrors, yet the XSE (a higher and pricier trim) does not. Also the gas tank has a 14.5 gallon capacity but bc of a shape design issue (Toyota is still finding a fix) when the tank is read as empty you can only load 9-10 gallons max, which doesn’t allow me to use the car at its full glory. I still really love it and once Toyota resolves the issue I’ll reconsider my rating. (I’ll add a full car photo tomorrow!)"
1702, a year ago,5,"Great ride, smooth ride but the one we owned lacked in features as it was an older version. However it was wonderful on fuel so got me from A to B easily."
1703, a year ago,5,Love my corolla It was thes best car I ever have never let me down. Good quality and good gas economy. Not much fun to drive but pretty secure
1704, a year ago,5,"I have the Rav4 hybrid and I love it. The gas mileage is great but it still is a powerful, fast car. The large touch screen is perfect size and looks great with the rest of the interior. This car is also perfect for road trips, especially if you have a dog."
1705, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my car! The technology is amazing and I feel so safe. It’s very spacious!

1712, a year ago,4,Love This 4 wheel drive. 1st car I drove and it’s great. Interior and exterior are definitely sporty
1713, a year ago,5,Me encanta! Diseńo moderno con todo lo necesario para ir protegida y viajar en un atumovil bonito. Me gusta mucho
1714, a year ago,4,"overall a great car in terms of price, gas costs, and environmental impact. i took of one star just because of how the car looks. definitely would recommend this car to anyone"
1715, a year ago,5,I bought a 2007 Camry when I left for college. I knew Toyotas are a reliable car and the Camry seemed like a good choice. 5 years later she still runs great! It is a roomy car without feeling too bulky. It runs well and is a smooth ride. it currently has 200k miles and keeps on going! 
1716, a year ago,5,The toyota corolla was my entry vehicle to automotive use and care. i love its low maintenace cost and fuel efficicy. I have always loved and recommend it.
1717, a year ago,5,Toyota is a great manufacturer and they make strong and fuel efficient vehicle. I love the stability and comfort most about the camry. I love it but not so much for a family of five and more.
1718, a year ago,5,"It is a very good car although very expensive also when it goes over 45,000 miles it sounds a lot on the road"
1719, a year ago,5,A 90 celica was my first vehicle! It was a fast little sports car that was super fun to drive. Maintenance was easy to keep up with and we even managed to change out parts easily ourselves. We drove this car until it had nearly 300k miles but unfortunately it blew a head on the engine. I was very impressed with this vehicle and would consider getting another one with all the current bells and whistles.
1720, a year ago,5,"I loved to ride in this car so much! It goes so smooth, it's very comfortable, beautiful design! It has everything you need!"

1726, a year ago,5,"I have had a lot of cars, this car is by far the BEST I have ever owned. The fact that it gets almost 50 miles to the gallon is one of the biggest perks!! Love it so much!! I would highly recommend!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
1727,a year ago,5,Perfect car for a new driver. I’ve had two and they’ve never let me down. You can easily get to 200k miles.
1728, a year ago,4,my mom had a highlander for 15 years i think. i drove it a good handful of times. it was pretty smooth and was easy to pick up speed but sometimes the car just felt heavy
1729, a year ago,5,Its very easy to drive and no mechanical problem since I bought. I recommend everyone to have this car. Its amazing and the color choice is fabulous. I love to drive everyday to my work. Just amazing.
1730, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my highlander... I love the versatility of having an suv...the second and third row seats fold down flat and i can haul my flowers, furniture, rummage sale finds, etc... true story, went to my mom's about a month ago, I brought back a dresser an two night stands... it is a very good investment in my humble opinion...  Toyota Highlander"

1736, a year ago,5,This was my first car. I have been driving a Toyota ever since. The Corolla is a great first car. It has all the modern features of a luxury sedan for half the price. Not to mention they drive just as smooth as a regular size sedan in my opinion.
1737, a year ago,5,This is one of the Best sedans on the road! I have owned the entire Toyota family. They offer a awesome product when it comes to a vehicle. I love the body style and interior on the new body style!
1738, a year ago,3,This is a good car for the family but not my type because the ride on it on the road is very rough it kills your back!
1739, a year ago,5,Muy lindo carro lo recomiendo muy seguro muy atractivo en gas muy espacioso muy bonito
1740,a year ago,5,This is a great car. I have owned 5 Toyota Camry's. They continue to run with no problems. I complete the routine maintenance by changing the oil etc. I have had no engine problems in the over 2 million collective miles driven. There is just a quality and feel that is present in Toyota that is not in other cars. 
1741, a year ago,3,"Smooth ride, it doesn’t seem like it would be a bad car to own and good on gas. That always helps!"
1742,a year ago,2,Ugh. Wasn’t the best. Rough ride. Always needed maintenance. Only thing good was the gas mileage.
1743, a year ago,4,"Drives smooth, roomy interior and trunk space, long lasting, easy repairs and lower cost in maintenance; prices have increased during previous years. "
1744, a year ago,5,I love this car I always said I won’t ever buy a Toyota until this line came out now I’m a owner and I pile the cha he it

1747,a year ago,5,"Best car ever! So good with the gas and never had any mechanical problem. Definitely recommend this car, especially as a first car. I had this car over 5 years and never had a problem. Only downside is I changed the headlights three times."
1748, a year ago,5,I recently bought a brand new 2020 Toyota Camry. It’s the best choice I’ve made. I’ve driven different makes however nothing compared to the reliability of my Camry. It’s quiet and extremely spacious
1749, a year ago,5,"Super smooth ride! Seats were nice leather, soft and comfortable. Good amount of leg room for a car. Also, seemed very responsive as far as steering, braking, etc. Tech on the inside was easy to use. Highly recommend!"
1750, a year ago,4,"I'm only making this a 4 star review given I've never OWNED one of this but rather have only been a passenger. But my stepdad has a hybrid Rav4 and I'm completely jealous. It's the perfect mid-sized SUV and the gas mileage and fact that it is hybrid is crazy. The ride is super smooth and all of the options, especially on the XSE, make this car feel like a luxury vehicle for only 35k. This will definitely be my next new vehicle but I just paid off my Camry so I plan to wait another 5 years or so. "
1751, a year ago,5,"My first car was a Mazda 3 and it started to have mechanical problems right around 40000 miles. Tires, engine mount(s), shuddering at lights, brakes, the works. So I traded it in for my Hybrid Camry (SE) and it was the best decision I've ever made. The engine in this car is POWERFUL and when you turn it on you can barely hear anything (similar to a Prius.) It gets 40+ miles to the gallon even now at 100k miles and 5 years later, and it has the normal ""getup and go"" of a non-hybrid vehicle, so much so that my boyfriend LOVES driving my car. Toyota's prepaid maintenance was a good value and I bought it up until 60k miles. Now that I'm at 100k I'm replacing my first parts (sway bars and the non-hybrid 12v battery) but outside of regularly scheduled maintenance I've only had to replace my tires (twice) prior to this. My brakes and everything else are still in great condition. This car has served me much better than my Mazda and I love feeling like I have a safe, dependable vehicle to carry me around. Totally recommend. "
1752, a year ago,4,"Toyota is a great general brand. Both my cars so far have been Toyota. Easy to navigate, features are good as well and the new cars have all the high tech stuff."
1753, a year ago,4,I really liked my Toyota Rav 4. It was pretty good on gas for the size of the car but I expected it to be more spacious
1754, a year ago,5,I have driven a camry and it it smooth ride. I own a totota Avalon which I prefer over the camry
1755, a year ago,5,"This is  a Wonderful car.  It gets super efficient gas mileage and runs smooth.  It is a Great car for family and for singles , too."
1756, a year ago,5,I LOVE my Toyota Corolla! I have had it for years and never had any problems with it. I was always told Toyota’s are some of the best and safest cars and I have to agree. I love how it is Bluetooth compatible so I can talk on the phone without taking my eyes off the road. Best car ever!
1757, a year ago,5,When it comes to classic and reliability then Toyota is your car brand. I own a Toyota Camry and it has been held strong though several winters and family trips over the years. So reliable that I handed down to my oldest as his first car.
1758, a year ago,5,"For 8 years I owned a 1999 Toyota corolla. It went years without messing up but then towards the end it did start needing plenty of things fix. Plus I had been in multiple car accident where I had ppl hit and run and getting a few things still lasted me. Good strong car, that is worth every penny."
1759, a year ago,5,We leased this vehicle from Toyota directly. It is the perfect size for city driving and the reverse parking camera helps out even the worst reverse parkers!
1760, a year ago,5,"We purchased this vehicle used from Toyota directly. Despite the high miles already on the car, it has been perfect. It’s never broken down and the maintenance costs are minimal at best."
1761, a year ago,5,Wonderfully fuel efficient while having a lovely presentation. My passengers believe it is a newer car than it actually is. The interior is very roomy. Its exterior has a subtle grace to it. You feel like you're driving a luxury car.
1762, a year ago,5,"These cars on another level! I know someone that has one for a very long time and almost has 450,000 miles on it, with basically no issues but needing new tires and breaks. When it turns on, you wouldn’t even know it the engine is so quite."
1763, a year ago,5,Really sturdy and reliable car! This is my current and first car I’ve owned and it’s very reliable
1764, a year ago,5,"I buy only Toyota! I currently own my third corolla. My husband also owns a Tacoma. These are great little cars. Good on gas, good looking, very energy efficient and doesn't cost your left kidney! They will just about last forever as long as you keep up the maintenance on it. My first was used. My second I bought brands new and drive it for 15 years before trading it in for another used one that was newer and has less mikeage. Keep in mind that during the 15 years I had the second car... I had a two hour a day commute between my home and work and I am The one that runs all the errands, does all the shopping, I have friends I see often that live 45 minutes to an hour one way away and I rolled that odometer TWICE during my ownership of that car. The reason I traded it in is because I am much older,band I am now handicapped and no longer work. My husband was concerned that I would soon start acquiring needed repairs that he himself would not be able to do. I highly recommend Toys to everyone I kniw, have for years! "
1765, a year ago,3,I had an older Camry and it was so much lighter than any other car I had driven. I would drift even in the slightest bit of snow. Ran well and easy maintenance but definitely wasn’t a good car for New England weather.
1766,a year ago,1,"Dear God, I loathe this car. The seats are terrible for long drives.  I mean excruciating! We drove down to Florida and I had to stop at a Walmart to get seat cushions as there is no support whatsoever! On the way back, my sciatic nerve was pinched from the bad seats! The navigation system is a POS as it sends you to dead ends.  It doesn’t read your text messages out loud if you are driving (CarPlay) .  Trunk storage is small. Gas guzzler ! Mind you it’s a 2019 Platinum fully loaded! I can’t wait for this lease to be over! I will never do Toyota again!"

1769, a year ago,5,"No major problems yet! I’ve had the car for about a year, it’s a 2020. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a car that keeps its value and wants to pay less for gas!"
1770, a year ago,5,"I have a 2005, but it’s still a great car. Gets good gas mileage and has saved me from a few accidents."
1771, a year ago,5,"I love my Sienna, at 1st I thought It was to big, I was going to have a problem parking, it was to low, I was going to be hitting it all the time, that it was a soccer mom van, but now I have got use to it and love 💘 we have the SE, leather seats, warm seats, and is very comfortable, there is 3 rows of seats so if you are going on a road trip you only have to take 1 car, and we have a great big screen for movies you can entertain the kids or even grownups, seats on the back fold if you need to put your luggage 🧳, so overhaul is a multi use SUB Van. 

#influenster #toyotasienna #roadtrip"
1772,a year ago,3,"A green four runner was my first car and I loved it. I had an older model, but the new ones look even better"
1773, a year ago,4,"We have this car for a town car and for my husband to drive to and from work. We absolutely live the gas mileage on it and it runs extremely smoothly and is spacious for when you need to run a quick errand. The back is very spacious for lots of groceries or suitcases, more than I expected! It’s really nice! "
1774, a year ago,4,"We bought the highlander after retiring our rav4 since we are a family of 5. It has a lot more space for the kids and the diaper bags, strollers and car seats we needed to get around town. It is such a smooth ride and has incredible performance! The gas mileage around town is good too and we’ve been very happy with how easily you can maintain it. "
1775, a year ago,4,"This car is great for travel and is perfect for a newly growing family. The only thing I wasn’t happy with was there’s not enough space for a family of 5. We needed more room not just for people, but for diaper bags, strollers and car seats. It’s a little too snug for all those things. "
1776,a year ago,5,"Love this car. Affordable and nice. My mom has an older, basic model and it's still very chic and smart for the price she paid. No negative things to say. Great gas mileage."
1777, a year ago,5,"This car is so durable that we have 5 of them in my family. We’ve have one since 2004; it made it through part of middle school, high school and college for me. I still drive it until this day and have no issues with it,"
1778, a year ago,5,"I will never not drive another Prius for probably the rest of my life. I love it. I live in Michigan where winters are rough, but my Prius does decent in the snow. It’s not a 4 wheel drive truck, but I’ve never gotten stuck (knock on wood). Gas mileage is great and I like to feel like I’m doing my part to better the environment by driving a hybrid."
1779, a year ago,5,"I haven’t had my RAV4 for a very long time, but it is definitely a great car. It gets good gas mileage, rides very smooth, and fits way more than you would expect. It’s also very comfortable and roomy!"
1780, a year ago,5,The Toyota Corolla is a very reliable car. Toyota in general has been known for making long-lasting vehicles and I find that’s very accurate and true. Also got very good gas mileage which is a huge plus.
1781, a year ago,5,It's a good car I like it. It's reliable and drives well and gets good gas mileage. Not super flashy or fancy but it's cute and a good car. The sound system is pretty good and the seats are comfy. It's affordable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a car.
1782, a year ago,4,I love my Toyota drives smoothly and lots of room for 5 people to fit comfortably .  Great on gas ⛽️ I would recommend this car to everyone.  And affordable on any budget
1783, a year ago,3,I was a passenger in this car but I did enjoy the ride I noticed it ride very smooth so I would not mine one day buying one for myself .
1784,a year ago,5,"I love my camry! It is a safe vehicle and great ride for a family of 3. Plenty of room for all of us. Also, is great on gas. Seems like it can just go and go without having to stop and always fill up. Toyota makes great, long lasting vehicle. Mine has over 100,00 miles and it still runs like the day it was purchased. They also keep their value!"
1785,a year ago,4,"This Suv is very spacious for traveling, but it does lack quality when driving it. Overall its a great car for daily use"
1786, a year ago,5,This car so great on gas around town and on the highway. So much room in the trunk. Good leg room in the back.
1787,a year ago,5,BEST CAR EVER. I have never had an issue with this car. I’ve had this car since 2010 and have about 160k miles on it. I gets about 45-50 mpg. I’ve taken multiple road trips along the east coast and into Canada without a problem. The hatchback makes it easier for moving and storing things. The seats in the back also drop for extra storage space. This is the ultimate road trip car that will save you a ton of gas $$$
1788,a year ago,5,My favorite part about this car is definitely the interior. Everything is so simple to use well looking modern. There’s so much storage in this car as well. It drives very smoothly and comfortably. Definitely recommend
1789, a year ago,5,"Our Yaris is 12 years old and still going strong. It is well-built, well-designed, and surprisingly roomy inside. It is an awesome little car and great to park in small spaces and so fun to drive. Definitely don't regret that purchase!"
1790,a year ago,4,"I love scion tcs! I’ve had many friends own them, and they have let me drive them. I almost bought one this year but went with a Mazda speed 3 instead only because the one I looked at had issues but if it didn’t I probably would of gone with the scion instead."
1791, a year ago,5,"My very first car was a Toyota Camry. It was a horrible red and yellow color, and it was a 1994. That car took me everywhere though. It was phenomenal on gas and got me from point a to point b. It definitely wasn’t a looker- but it got the job done."
1792, a year ago,5,"I rented this vehicle by accident. I was supposed to get a full-size car, but there were issues at the counter and the agent suggested a van and I obliged. We had a very long trip, Georgia to Connecticut. My teenagers LOVED the space in the back. I loved the functional space for a driver. If it were better on mileage, I’d most certainly buy one."
1793, a year ago,5,"Toyota Prius is one of the most reasonably economical and comfortable cars I’ve been in that’s affordable. It drives very smoothly, and it is very reliable, in my opinion. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a solid vehicle without spending too much money."
1794, a year ago,5,Toyota is a very comfortable car and gets super gas mileage. I don’t drive it much as it is my husbands car but I have loaned it to a few people when needed and both of them fell in love.
1795, a year ago,3,I drove my sisters Corolla around when i@first started driving. The cars horn was the dinkiest horn. I wasn’t a fan of the brakes and overall the car was just fine. It was affordable for her first car so that’s when I would recommend.
1796, a year ago,3,"My dad had a Camry and I personally didn’t like the look of the car. After a few years, the top liner of the car started falling off. He didn’t seem to like the car and eventually traded it in. We like the Toyota brand though!"
1797, a year ago,5,My car is very old in fact is made out of steel and not plastic lol but she is still kickin it I will definitely buy another Camry when this one is done for
1798,a year ago,4,"I love my car. I am from the country, so the only down side about this is they aren’t the best in snow. I love the backup camera, has great heat/AC and a bigger size truck (for all you shoppers out there). I get great gas mileage and if you’re looking for a nice car to get around in, I’d say this is the one!"
1799, a year ago,3,I owned one of these a few years back. It was a nice drive and pretty reliable. Easy to maintain and would recommend for a late teen or early 20’s drivers.
1800, a year ago,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE. It does drive more like a truck. Sits higher than most SUVs and loud start up. Drives VERY smooth. Has third row seating but with third row up it leaves very little trunk space. I won’t ever own another car other than a 4Runner.
1801, a year ago,5,Definitivamente es un carro para el diario hasta poca gasolina y súper bueno y noble
1802, a year ago,5,"Tengo este carro y es un lujo, me encanta lo suave y rápido que reacciona. Además de inteligente amo mi Camry"
1803, a year ago,4,"So good, i have one toyota yaris since 2006, and it still functions! Then, my parents have another Toyota Yaris, the new one and it’s amazing. I love the Bluetooth stereo and the agility to drive it."
1804, a year ago,5,"I love my car , it's really portable, is black and I try to have this one so clean, and my husband help me with that"
1805, a year ago,5,"This is our backup car, a car we bought new 15 years ago and is still our favourite even after new cars have been bought, we just can't seem to let it go because it's such an efficient and well built car for running errands and getting around"
1806, a year ago,5,Absolutely one of my favorite crossovers. The newer years are super impressive. We have a 2019 and it has so really cool features.
1807, a year ago,5,"My husband surprised me with our car, at first I was frustrated he didn’t take me with him to decide together. Now years later, I shouldn’t have ever even been upset! This car is wonderful and I am in love! Our family is growing and I don’t want to give up my car! It has gone through many road trips across country and numerous trips to the beach and mountains! Reliable isn’t even the word! I love this car so much and I’m so happy my husband took the chance and went for it!"
1808, a year ago,5,My brother has this car...I go for rides in it. It's not bad..not my favorite design. Kind of boring. Basic model really is basic. It is good on gas and reliable vehicle. Just not my type.
1809, a year ago,4,"My hubby owns a toyota corolla and he enjoys driving it. I don't drive though.
Its a Low mentainance and affordable car.😇"
1810, a year ago,5,"I bought mine brand new in 2017 and it hasn’t failed me yet. I love the safety features and the touch screens. My family is a Honda family, but the same thing at Honda was at least a few grand more for no reason. I commute a long way to work and it’s worn nicely!"
1811, a year ago,4,"I love this car, it has great gas mileage and a smooth ride. It has plenty of storage space and roomy seats as well. I love the built in navigation and ease of use. I also really love the automatic lift gate, great for when you have full hands or are unable to lift your arms up."
1812,a year ago,5,my mom and I love our 2016 toyota rav4 we got it in 2016 and she is upgrading her car this year. but overall amazing vehicle. Has everything the family needed
1813, a year ago,5,"would very recommend this car to a single person or a person with a family. This is a very well equipped car. Great for driving in town and out of town. Also, lasts a long time before breaking down and needing maintenance. Also a really good car on gas. "
1814, a year ago,3,Very good! It's roomy even with all the kid's stuff. Very smooth and comfortable to drive. Highly recommended!
1815, a year ago,4,I was very happy with the Rav4. It's compact and user friendly. We upgraded due to not having enough space with two car seats. It's just seemed a bit cramped.
1816, a year ago,4,Great car and very user friendly. No complaints and I would definitely consider purchasing again in the future. Always have had a positive experience.
1817, a year ago,4,"To me, these have always been a trustworthy, enjoyable car. On the top of my list for reliability and would purchase again."
1818, a year ago,5,"This is a SUV that drives like a sedan this car is such a good vehicle and gets decent gas mileage for being an SUV. Overall, this car is very spacious and nice throughout and a really good price. 10/10 would recommend"
1819, a year ago,5,Okay little car - fully paid off still only has 100k miles on it and is a trooper. Will drive it till it dies before o upgrade
1820, a year ago,5,"It was years ago when I owned a 4 runner, but it was the most amazing vehicle I have ever owned.  It had the most amazing stereo system, had the smoothest ride ever.  It was well built, a little on the expensive side but if you have the money and can afford one, you must have this vehicle.  I highly recommend this vehicle and I will have one again and you should too.  :)"
1821, a year ago,4,This is my first car ever and I have to say she have been serving me well. She has gone through some craziness and messiness as a first car with a college student. I would definitely recommend. My whole family have toyotas! Great with gas as well. My car is cute and spacious. Toyota’s gift with the 5 free oil changes really made me feel special and their service has always been smooth.
1822,a year ago,5,My mons have this car is a RAv4  2017 is super comfortable. Is super economic  car and. Have greats feature. I think this car don't  need any improvement.  If 10 is a expensive car this is a 4. I recommend.
1823,a year ago,4,Is a family car that  is super comfortable and strong car that last many many year  if I have to say any cons will be  the suspension is firm. To improve this car just need a better suspension. Is expensive but your money worth  what you paying.  Yes I  recommend.
1824, a year ago,5,My husband recently bought a Cruiser and it’s a great car. Decent gas mileage and great features. Very spacious and we love the roof rack to transport kayaks and Christmas trees! Love that the interior floors can be sprayed out to keep clean. A fun car to have!
1825, a year ago,5,Very dependable! My friend had one that lasted her 15 years! I have never in my life seen someone own the same vehicle for more then 10 years! It had really nice factory radio too! The base really pumped in it!
1826, a year ago,5,I used to drive a Toyota Camry until I was in a car accident and let me tell you this car is one of the safest cars I ever owned. It was completely totaled when someone t boned me. The paramedics said that I should of been a lot worse than I was and that it was truly a miracle.
1827, a year ago,5,"Affordable, comfortable, less mileage coverage and yes very user friendly for a student trying to cut down expenses to manage a budget !!! Requires minimum maintenance as long as you do your inspection and oil change you are good and safe on the roads"
1828, a year ago,4,Love driving these. A little gutless compared to my car but 4runners aren’t meant for speed. Great handling and lots of room. The fuel mileage isn’t spectacular but a great family vehicle or can also be a great off road vehicle with modifications. Love the back window feature but the 2017 I drove could really use some tech upgrades. The nav/Bluetooth seems dated
1829, a year ago,5,This car had great mileage to a gallon of gasoline and if vehicle need repairing they were not very expensive
1830, a year ago,4,I would love to own one of these but the price is high! However if you own one they hold their value!
1831, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Sienna is the only minivan I recommend.  I previously had 3, switched to a SUV for business purposes, and I miss driving the van.  This is coming from a girl who said she would never drive a van..now I can’t wait to get back into one.  The easiest vehicle to have for families with children."
1832, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota. I totally recommend it. Such a good car! My mom had it first and she bought me a Mercedes but I stayed with the Toyota😂

1835, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Corolla is an extremely reliable car. They are compact and absolutely great on gas, which is a necessity because that saves a lot of money on something that you are required to have. It's also low maintenance. As long as you get your oil changes regularly, you'll be just fine."
1836, a year ago,5,"Toyota is the leader in car safety technology, with its undeniable reliability and style that rivals expensive luxury cars. Once inside you feel like you are inside an expensive luxury vehicle with its vast technology, beautiful interior and outstanding performance!! Never going to another brand like Toyota, ruler of the automobile industry"
1837, a year ago,5,It is an Econ car that save gas and plenty of space for a kid’s bike.  Can’t beat the mileage.
1838, a year ago,5,"I love my Rav4! I have the limited trim that has everything you can want in a car and more. Including ventilated and heated seats, heated steering wheel, rain sensor for wind shield wipers, safety features to keep you in between the lines and keeps a safe distance between you and the car in front of you during cruise control and more.. if you’re looking for a smooth ride and want luxury at an affordable price- check out the 2019 rav4 limited, with Toyota you can’t go wrong!!"
1839, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota RAV4. The interior and gadgets are amazing. The vehicle rides very smoothly. The trunk space is big and I was able to fit a ton of items in there while moving.
1840, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota Highlander limited. Spacious up front, has every little gadget I would dream of!"
1841, a year ago,5,"We love our Prius. In addition to the great gas mileage, we love the roominess (it's not the larger version, but we could fit a treadmill in it) the low amount of repairs (we've had it for 7 years, put 170,000 miles on it and had no issues other than routine maintenance such as brakes and tires) and the smooth drive."
1842, a year ago,5,Me encanta mi auto es bello y confortable es mi pies a todos lados me encanta que te puedo decir al respecto muy recomendado
1843, a year ago,5,"My husband has a Toyota Camry and has for years. It is a reliable car and he can drive them for well over 200,000 miles"
1844, a year ago,4,It's a great car! May look small but it is quite spacious. Very sporty which I like very much. The only thing I would say is to be careful driving through speed humps because of the low profile of the car it sometimes hits the bottom.
1845, a year ago,5,2002 Toyota Sequoia. It's still running perfectly. The car from my entire childhood and now I'm the one driving this thing. Toyota is absolutely reliable and durable and this car is a prime example. Still powerful and got that comfort feeling of an SUV.
1846, a year ago,5,"It's the best selling car for a reason! Toyota is just simply reliable and durable. The corolla that my sister has is 8 years old and still going great. A basic car with many features at a great value. For a starter car or someone who wants a compact car, I believe there is no other way but the Toyota Corolla way."
1847, a year ago,5,"My Toyota RAV4 saved my life, literally. I was in a car accident and the car was totaled, however I walked away with minor injuries. I ended up buying the same exact car because I love and trust it that much."

1849, a year ago,5,"The best car I've ever had. Hardly ever has broken down. I have the 2016 Rav4 and I love the bluetooth, backup camera, and lane-changing alerts. I always feel very safe. This is a car that I would definitely recommend to friends and would buy my children. "
1850, a year ago,5,"I owned a Corolla before my current car and I can’t say enough good things about it. The gas mileage, the style, and the comfort were all 5 stars for me. The only reason I went with anything else was because there was another dealership 2 minutes down the road from my house! I think after my current car, I will go back to Toyota!"
1851,a year ago,5,Great family cars! They ride smooth and are really quite. They are super well built as well. This would also be a great first car!
1852, a year ago,5,"My sister owns this car and I absolutely LOVE IT! you rarely EVER need gas , super great on miles and overall just awesome ! It’s very much affordable for anyone looking for a first car and/or a family car."

It’s features are very nice, the price wasn’t outrageous, and it rides very smoothly. I am almost scared to drive it it’s so nice."
1856, a year ago,5,"I had a hybrid and loved it until it was time to trade it in. It served me, my farm lifestyle and family well. I owned on older model and didn’t think I would ever trade it in, however, it began having problems at around 200,000 miles and, alas, it had to go."
1857, a year ago,5,"Though an older model Prius, this car gets such great gas mileage and is comfortable to drive. It was difficult to give this vehicle, but it was time."
1858, a year ago,5,I feel so safe in this car and super comfy ! My friend drives one too and we both love it!
1859, a year ago,5,This was the first car I ever owned. It helped en learn how to drive and i saved a lot of money in gas. I would have kept it longer but I needed a newer car.
1860, a year ago,5,I really loved this car. It was a 2020 Toyota Camry with red interior and egg shell exterior. And I loved how easily you could drive it and how nice it looked.
1861, a year ago,3,"It was a really nice car, it saved a lot in gas. But it was just not my prefer car because if it’s shape and how small it looked."
1862, a year ago,5,"Great car. Extremely reliable and haven’t run into any mechanical issues for years. Great mileage as well, love this car and affordable compared to other companies. Overall, definitely recommend and the most important thing is that it is reliable!"
1863, a year ago,5,Just got our new car! Toyota hybrid actually and we love it! Great for kids and it’s 2021! Feel truly blessed!
1864,a year ago,5,"My partner has a Camry, and it’s perfect for a daily commute or long trip. They are very spacious with high quality interiors. I believe they are a very affordable option, highly recommend."
1865, a year ago,5,There’s a gray SUV. It’s comfortable and has lots of room. You can even find an air mattress made for the back so that you can go camping and sleep in the car rather than on the ground. The only trouble is the gas mileage is not great compared to two other cars. ￼
1866, a year ago,5,Nice travel buddy car for long drive. The features of this car are great easy to drive. It’s good also for gas you can save.
1867, a year ago,4,"I love these SUVs. I’ve had the privilege of riding in this type of vehicle because both my uncle and my cousin has them. One has a gold one, the other the black. My personal favorite is the black version, of course (hence the picture). They drive great and the ride is smooth. The only two draw backs are, when we took it on vacation, we did have to stop to fill the tank up quite frequently, but I suspect that is the case with any sport utility vehicle. The only other con that I have is that with my husband and two sons, all of who are over six feet tall was not a comfortable ride for all, at the same time, but I am not sure I can completely blame the vehicle for that as that’s genetics, but still, it wasn’t as comfortable a ride for them as it was for me. All in all, Toyotas are very reputable in the auto industry, so quite naturally their SUV will rank rather highly as well. If you take care of them, they’ll definitely take care of you; both my uncle and my cousin’s odometer had close to two hundred thousand miles on it, yet the ride was still impressive."
1868, a year ago,5,"My first car was a Toyota Corolla-silver. I had it from 2003 to 2017. It was a great car! Good gas mileage, super dependable and minimal maintenance. It is an affordable car, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this car as it was a huge part of my life and many memories were made with this car!"
1869, a year ago,4,"I drive a 2008 and it is enjoyable to drive.  It is a hybrid, so great on gas.  One downside is the radio gets a little staticy when it switches to battery power, but not a big deal.  Can't say how affordable new is, but bought used, and in great shape."
1870,a year ago,5,I absolutely love driving this car!!!! I was impressed with the one my parents have but then I got my own and could not be happier. 
1871, a year ago,5,My husbands Prius prime is a great little commuter car. It has a lot of pick up and he is really happy with it. I like the flexibility of both EV and HV. I think it was the right price and the right car for him and his needs commuting. Highly reliable (like all Toyotas) and highly recommended.
1872, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my Rav4. I was always a sedan or compact person until I got this SUV. It fits all 3 of my dogs and luggage, accessories for adventures. It has AWD which is great for the mountains in CA. If I ever have to get another car I will get another RAV4, maybe even the upcoming RAV4 prime!"
1873, a year ago,5,"I love Toyota!! I first fell in love with a Toyota 4Runner when I was 11 years old. My dad was a salesman and had a white 1993 or 1994  4Runner as his demo. Later in life I was a delivery coordinator at a Toyota dealership and I loved it!! My whole family owns Toyota products. We’ve had 4Runner, Sienna, Tacoma, Tundra, RAV4, Yaris and even a 1988 Supra!  I love the reliability and the value of Toyota!!! My favorite is my 2nd generation 4Runner with 300,000 miles! It is a beast driving in the snow!! I can’t wait to get a TRD Pro 4Runner in the near future!! #YotaLife Thank you, Toyota for years of reliability!! Toyota 4RunnerToyota Motor Company"
1874, a year ago,4,I love Toyota’s. I have had several and they last forever.  I will always but Toyota because they are reliable and it drives smooth
1875, a year ago,5,Perfecto para mis necesidades y para las de mi familia. Me gusta el carro la verdad.lo recomiendo
1876, a year ago,5,Nice little car and great fuel economy.  It's a very reliable vehicle (like all Toyotas) and has great performance.  It is also quite stylish for a small sedan.  I definitely recommend this model (we own three!) and would purchase again! Can't beat Toyota!
1877, a year ago,4,I LOVE my FJ Cruiser!  It is comfortable and I love how high up I sit.  The fuel economy is adequate and it is a very reliable vehicle-- never had a problem with it.  And GREAT performance!  It's peppy and responds really well.  It's sad that Toyota has decided to discontinue it.  I only gave it 4 stars because 360 degree visibility is obstructed due to the car design and the size of the external mirrors but otherwise I definitely recommend it!
1878, a year ago,4,"Good basic car.  Can't beat Toyota's reliability!  A Corolla is a good first car, very reliable, very economic, but also small, and not really suitable as a family car. It is more affordable than most Toyota models and it performs really well with great fuel economy.  Definitely recommend."
1879, a year ago,5,"We love our Highlander. The store away this does seating has been great in a pinch and it feels like a solid ride. Of course there is also the undeniable reliability of a Toyota. It was a bit pricey but compared to other vehicles with  similar features, it was worth it."
1880, a year ago,5,Had a Highlander from 2004 - 2010. Very reliable! Designed very well. No blind spots in the windshield and can have the windows open in the rain without rain guards!! That truck took a beating and held up. Held its value really well and got a good trade in for it. Miss it!!
1881, a year ago,4,Ok I own an OLD Toyota Matrix. 04 to be exact. But I’ve had it about 4 years. When I tell you this old car holds up - it does. I rarely have to take her in for issues and she’s great with mileage. I love it. Only thing is i wish her pick me up was quicker but I can’t complain.
1882, a year ago,5,"I had a white FJ cruiser. This car is wonderful, and I was lucky enough to drive it in high school. It is great for off-roading, and I love the size. It's not super affordable, but it is cute. I only wish it had doors for the back seats. "
1883, a year ago,4,For a 1999 my avalon is a really good car that I would recommend to  a friend without hesitation. Also since its a Toyota to replace the parts when necessary they are relatively cheap and i don't have to go to the dealership to get anything fixed on it. Which is a personal pet peeve of mine on how cars are currently being made.
1884, a year ago,5,It’s an amazing car drives great looks good great on gas mileage used to own one in 1980 Toyota Celica and it was the car that lasted me 10+ years
1885, a year ago,4,Nice ride comfortable  drives great good on gas a little to big for me I’m not in to this type of vehicle
1886, a year ago,5,Love this product! Worth the buy! You should try it if you haven’t! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
1887, a year ago,5,Love this product! Worth the buy! You should try it if you haven’t! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
1888, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my Toyota Rav4 Sport! Excellent handling, safe, reliable and sporty. It has all tbe bells and whistles needed, and they are VERY durable. 
My SUV is actually almost 14 yrs old, but one would never know it! The paint still looks brand new and there's no wear on the interior at all! 

If you want a reliable vehicle that you can be a proud owner of, and ride in style, buy Toyota!!"
1889, a year ago,5,The perfect vehicle for me to haul my two young grandsons to the ark or appointments or my two large dogs to the vet or dog park to play. Easy and gas.
1890, a year ago,5,Excelente carro súper bueno y económico en repuesto duradero en motor es un carro que no pide dinero solo volante y chola 😋
1891, a year ago,5,My brother owns this car and is very smooth to drive and efficient! Very beautiful interior.
1892, a year ago,3,"For me and my family, personally this car is very big. It is 8 passenger seat and it’s just 3 of us so by space it’s big but other than that it runs smoothly and it very easy to drive. Definitely would recommend to big families:)"
1893, a year ago,5,"This car is very quite, its nice car, very good in gas you can save. This is good for long drive since it has eco fuel. Also I love the feature inside this car."
1894, a year ago,4,"Comfortable ride and great on fuel. The vehicle lasted very long and very little maintenance. Currently the vehicle is built much lower and smaller. Bought used at a great price. Would recommend this car, new or used!"
1895, a year ago,5,"This is a very smooth driving vehicle, great gas mileage. I have not had any problems with the Toyota Camry I have been driving. Only cost about $30 to full the tank up and get close to 500 miles if not more."
1896,a year ago,5,"En mi opinión personal considero que es un vehículo muy bonito en nivel estético, ya que lo hace muy atractivo a la vista, de los interiores me agrada bastante porque es espacioso y sus asientos son muy cómodos esto hace un viaje placentero y cómodo, lo recomiendo bastante."
1897, a year ago,5,"It has been a long time since I had this car but I loved it. It is easy to drive, nice looking and easy to take care of."
1898, a year ago,4,Sturdy car. Can be a bit hard to turn and park because of its size but overall feel really safe in this car and love its size.
1899, a year ago,5,"Toyota Prius was my first car. I loved it, it was so easy to drive, gas mileage was amazing, filling up the tank didn’t cost an arm and a leg. Great first car."
1900, a year ago,5,"Best car to take to the beach or road trips. Fits the entire fam, including dogs comfortably. Haven’t had any issues with the car."
1901, a year ago,5,toyota builds a fantastic car!!   they will run for years without a problem.  i've seen toyota's with over 200k miles on them and they're still running.  this is a car where the body will give out before the engine does!
1902, a year ago,5,"I love Highlanders. They have lots of seating for big families, backup cameras, and a dashboard display that can be used for multiple things like navigation, radio, bluetooth, etc. Reliable, low matinence, affordable SUV that can handle most any terrain. If you need a car that will last many years this is a good choice."
1903, a year ago,4,"Received this car as a gift & it's the first car I've owned. It's kind of small which is the biggest downside to me, but it gets great mileage and doesnt cost much to full up. Its pretty low matinence which is perfect for me. Although theres only 2 air vents they WORK and you dont even notice because they do a great job of carrying air throughout. Smooth ride. Overall good option if you dont need a ton of space."
1904, a year ago,5,Que puedo decir es el mejor para mi la mejor marca ami me encanta mi carro Toyota Camry se maneja súper y nunca he tenido problema desde que lo compre para mi el mejor de todos 🥰🥰🥰 Toyota Camry
1905, a year ago,4,"Great, reliable car. It’s no wonder Camrys have been around so long and are one of the most popular cars around. The newer ones are stylish and have good performance. Comfortable inside and great accessories."
1906, a year ago,5,"My favorite car! Design, comfort, gas usage everything is perfect in this car! I used to have one, but had to sell it, still missing my RAV4"
1907, a year ago,5,"Es un buen vehículo, tiene buen desarrollo, no consume mucho combustible y es uno de los mejores vehículos"
1908, a year ago,5,"Buen vehículo, tiene una capacidad de manejo muy buena y es un vehículo con muy buen espacio."
1909, a year ago,5,"Some of my family members own a Rav4, so I have plenty of experience riding in these. The suspension feels great when you hit a bump. It cruises on the interstate with ease. I would recommend this to smaller families."
1910, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my 4Runner. It is the most reliable vehicle that I have ever owned, and I never have to worry about it leaving me stranded in any situation. It has roughly two-hundred thousand miles on it and is showing no signs of slowing down."
1911, a year ago,5,Such a reliable and great car. Will never own a never type of car I love the room and the V8 in it. It’s always reliable and I love it
1912, a year ago,4,I love my car! I have a 2013 so it feels like a mom car but honestly I love it. I’ll be trading it in for a newer Camry soon but they are average-priced and reliable. Fixing any issues that may arise is not ridiculously expensive either!
1913, a year ago,5,By far my favorite car. Big and roomy. Comfortable. Easy to handle. Great on gas. Holds down to the road.
1914,a year ago,2,Don’t love it. It’s so small and sometimes it’s so quiet I don’t turn it off and come outside hours later and it’s running. 👀
1915, a year ago,5,"A great vehicle with so much room!! This is the best vehicle for our family, because there is so much room!"
1916, a year ago,5,A great option for an in between for a car and a SUV. Love this vehicle - both riding and driving it!
1917, a year ago,5,"Absolutely love this car, just wish it wasn’t so expensive! It drives so smooth and is a wonderful vehicle."
1918, a year ago,5,I love my Corolla! It’s a compact car but still roomy enough to have a car full of people!
1919, a year ago,5,Ok this was one of my first suvs I ever purchased. I needed a bigger car to transport the kiddos and all their equipment to and from games and practice. The car runs smooth and has plenty of room it’s a go to vehicle for me.
1920, a year ago,5,"Love Toyota and this is my second time owning a Corolla. I know I can rely on this brand name of car. It has a great reputation, it is good quality in that it is made to last a long time. It is great on gas and it has a good turn over if you ever want to sell your car later and upgrade. It is great on gas for mileage. It is a very roomy backseat for passengers seating back there."
1921,a year ago,5,"I love this car! Best first car ever! Doesn’t give me any problems and it has all my favorite features. I don’t know much about cars, but this one I’m sure I will have for a long time. So in love with my Luna (that’s my cars name)"
1922, a year ago,5,"Este es el de mi marido y la verdad que somos muy fieles a Toyota, siempre dan muy buen resultado!"
1923, a year ago,5,Enamorada de mi coche! Es automático y además es híbrido! No solo es cómodo si no que también es ecológico!
1924, a year ago,5,"I love this car, it has a lot of cool features and it's very spacious and comfortable. Its also very good on gas and has all the newest safety features. It isn't overly expensive either. I really don't have anything bad to say about this car, I would definitely recommend!"
1925, a year ago,4,"Great made car. Very sturdy and over my year of owning I never experienced an issue. The I my reason I wouldn’t give a higher rating is because I feel the interior could be more impressive. But if flashy isn’t your style, no need to worry! The back window is amazing and it drives great!"
1926, a year ago,5,Use to have 2004 Prius until a lady hit me head on and totaled it out. I loved and missed it so much though that I bought me a 2011 prius
1927, a year ago,4,They are great cars and quite a reasonable price but they just don’t make Toyota’s like they used to. Mine started to sound a bit rough and didn’t have much go from when I first bought it so I sold it.
1928, a year ago,5,Spacious and well built. I love this vehicle. It was pricier than some car brands but will hold its resale value.
1929, a year ago,5,Love my Toyota. Have had no mechanical issues. Gets good mileage and has a great resale value.
1930, a year ago,5,"Love my Camry, drives smoothly, is safe for me and my family. I save money on gas because it doesn't use to much gas."
1931, a year ago,5,"Living in the great Northwest requires a vehicle that gets around in all terrain. Our 4-runner is a beast when it comes to being a versatile vehicle for all kinds of weather and conditions. We comfortably fit 2 full-sized car seats in the second row, and still have tons of room in the back for more."
1932, a year ago,5,My all time favorite vehicle. I have owned a 1998 and it lasted a long time. Will be purchasing a newer camry in the near future
1933, a year ago,5,"I love Toyotas not only are they in the top for safety ratings, but they are fuel efficient.  I fill my tank and it can last up to 2 weeks depending on how much driving I do.  I feel safe driving this car and even more I know my kids are safe."
1934, a year ago,5,"Me gusta mucho porque son fuertes y rápidos y especialmente para mujeres a mi parecer, yo lo tome de segunda mano y la verdad esta muy bueno"
1935,a year ago,5,"I love, love my Rav 4. This vehicle is perfect in size for family. The kids love the way the back seats can recline separately."
1936, a year ago,5,Absolutely love! Roomy slick sweet! Stylish! Would most definitely recommend especially for Toyota! What a steal! I’d consider this for my next purchase
1937, a year ago,5,"Toyota Camry Es un carro de lujo, es muy cómodo y gasta poco combustible. Es un carro bonito y elegante."
1938,a year ago,5,Camrys are very practical cars but have a smooth ride and are very sexy... I think I can say that  lol! Anyway I love the Camry inside and out! They are affordable in my book and I would recommend it to anyone I know.
1939, a year ago,4,They are nice but I am not quite sure what all of the hype is about. The interior looks dated and I wish that Toyota would give it a makeover. Exterior doesn’t need changing and looks great but the interior is a dealbreaker for me and I would not purchase for that reason. 
1940,a year ago,4,"I love Toyota! My family had used this brand since I was a kid. They make quality automobiles. I love my corolla, it's great on gas, compact and dependable. It would be nice to have more options for the CE models."
1941, a year ago,5,My daughter and I both drive Toyota’s. Mine was still working so well I gave it to my daughter and got another one! Awesome reliable brand
1942, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota! My mechanic says it’s super easy to work on and I’ve only had minor things to repair and maintain. Great reliable car I would recommend to anyone! #Toyota Motor Company
1943,a year ago,5,Best running vehicle I’ve ever had mine is a 2004 and it runs better than my husbands car who is 10 years newer highly recommend
1944,a year ago,3,I dont like the outer body buts its overall a good truck for a family! Rides nicely.
1945, a year ago,5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE my car. His name is Pubert, and he is a 2007 Red Toyota Camry. He is absolutely amazing, and he gets me where I need to go. I am so thankful for him, and he is an amazing first car that will las me a long long time...I hope............."
1946, a year ago,5,I loved my Corolla! It was super cute and sporty. It drove great and was the perfect price. Great MPG. Super comfortable for long drives and road trips.
1947, a year ago,5,"Es muy bueno, gasta poco combustible y es muy cómodo de manejar a la hora de hacer largos viajes."
1948, a year ago,5,I loved my 4Runner but a little big for my needs. I do miss sitting up high. Really reliable also. ￼
1949, a year ago,5,"Toyota vehicles in general will last forever. The Camry is functional yet still sporty enough to pass as an all over use vehicle. And price wise is amazing it is very affordable, very easy and smooth to drive, technology is amazing."
1950, a year ago,5,Sister just got a brand new car. It’s sharp! The 2021 Corolla in Nightshade is absolutely stunning. The gas mileage is phenomenal and frankly I don’t think there is a downside to the toyota products.
1951, a year ago,5,Compared to other cars this car fits more people and it also has a lot of truck space and space in the car. This car is also a smooth ride and doesn’t make any noise or anything like that. I would recommend
1952, a year ago,5,I grew up with a Toyota Corolla before my family bought a Previa. I've always thought that Toyota's were long-lasting and reliable vehicles and I would buy one without hesitation.
1953, a year ago,5,"I actually owned the Echo version of this car. I love Toyotas, I grew up with my family owning them and I just find them very reliable and they work well for a long time. I loved my little Echo until my family outgrew it."
1954, a year ago,5,"I bought this car when it was traded in at the dealership I worked at. I love every aspect of it. I bought it used at 31k miles and now I'm over 40k. It has AMAZING fuel economy. Approximately 29 city and 41 hwy. Shifts smooth, suspension is smooth and reliable, and overall a very safe and reliable car for me, my wife, and 2 year old son. My only complaints is its not compatible with Sirius XM but that's fixable, and the Toyota app is atrocious so I had to get an aftermarket remote start installed but its not very expensive. The on screen GPS is decent but it goes through an app on your phone and is a huge hassle. But for all I know it could be my specific submodel. In a nutshell it is an amazing car."
1955, a year ago,4,"The car is great , except the road noise. we have so many features like seat heating , adjustments , roof top , comfortable driving , affordable , safe driving with warning signs, lights , beeping through rare when approaching a car and it’s sensors are outstanding."
1956, a year ago,2,"I am not the happiest with my scion. I have had to put more work into it then I feel I should, honestly I feel it to be poorly done."
1957, a year ago,4,Great van with enough space for everything! Seats are easy to move and adjust depending on number of passengers and the heating and air circulate very well
1958, a year ago,5,I had a Toyota Sequoia 2002 and it was reliable. Just oil change and regular maintenance. Pro if you just do regular maintenance you can put lots of miles. Con if you don't keep up with it it won't be as reliable. I would recommend but gas mileage is not good.
1959, a year ago,3,There is not much room. It feels cramped for a full size suv. Our kids car seats were cramped in the back and the heat/air did not reach back there to them. They were always too hot or too cold!
1960,a year ago,5,"Loved this car when I owned it! Had I not moved to snowy Colorado, I would’ve kept my Corolla. It rode smooth and had plenty of space for five people. The trunk space was great too. I would recommend this car!"
1961,a year ago,5,I have a 2017 RAV4 and absolutely love it! Everyone who rides with me says it rides so smooth. It does well in the snow and is a breeze to drive. I also enjoy the cruise control features and how much space there is in the back. I fit a twin size bed in the back once all the seats were down. Super spacious!
1962, a year ago,5,"Love my Sennia!! I've not had a bit of trouble with mine and I've racked up the miles in it. It's got plenty of room if you have a family as big as mine. I have 5 kids so room is a must. The van rides and drives amazing, the gas mileage is great as well."
1963, a year ago,5,"I love my car, even if it is 12 years old and if I had to buy all over again, I would buy the same one.  Once I do update cars, I hope to get another highlander or a rav4.  I love the options I have with this car such as heater seats, awd, sun roof, traction controls and such. These are things that came into other cars at a later day.  Toyota is always ahead of the game.  My only problem so far is the ac when out and I hope to get fixed soon. "
1964, a year ago,5,"Good car. Colors and functionality is good.
Range is good, price is ok.
Love the deign."
1965, a year ago,5,"Excellent, reliable and cost efficient vehicle that gets me safely from one place to another. Have owned a Toyota for years and love it, it’s affordable and good for single or families. Highly recommended vehicle!"
1966, a year ago,4,"I bought my brand new Toyota Corolla in 2018, and so far, the car has been very reliable and now issues. I decided to buy this car based on my parents' and relative's recommendations and I don't regret my purchase. "
1967, a year ago,5,"My dad got one on 7-7-07. We LOVE it! I have always wanted his truck. So safe, dependable, and not horrible on gas for a large vehicle. "
1968, a year ago,5,Top of the line vehicle! Couldn’t be happier with our new addition! Needed a new vehicle for our growing family and this truck is the best! Roomy and beautiful! It provides you with great mileage and reliability is key !
1969, a year ago,5,"Long lasting with little maintenance. Gets good gas mileage and holds up to wear and tear. Runs on the more expensive side even when used, but can travel longer mileage than most cars. Drove one past 250,000 and sold as it still worked. Have more of a tendency to leak oil later in their lifetime. "
1970, a year ago,5,"Renting, driving this spacious car was great. I was surprised that my seven foot tall child was able to fit in it comfortably and  still had legroom."
1971, a year ago,4,Renting and driving this vehicle was enjoyable. It was worth the rental fee & wouldn't mind renting it again.
1972, a year ago,5,I loved the whole design of the truck and everything how I run and everything is very beautiful inside
1973, a year ago,5,"Cute car and seems to run well.  The efficiency is also great.  Although I haven’t driven one, it seems like a good car"
1974, a year ago,5,"My last two cars have both been Camry’s, they have great safety features, they drive beautifully not to mention how absolutely GORGEOUS they are, my current one is a pearly white with red interior, ♥️ it!!!"
1975,a year ago,5,This sedan has amazing power for the size and style of car. Its sleek and classy no matter what color. The interior is very well thought out and accessible. My only complaint is while I'm short I somehow still hit my head exiting the vehicle.
1976, a year ago,5,"I love the reliability of Toyota and the compact, yet still roomy size of my Corolla."
1977, a year ago,5,My corolla is a good reliable car that gets great mileage.  The corolla is an affordable car and is great on gas.  Its a small car that is easy to maneuver.  I would definitely recommend a corolla to anyone!
1978, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my toyota camry!! It's nice to look at, runs incredibly well all the time!! Always has the best features available. I love the back up camera"
1979, a year ago,5,"I had a 2004 Toyota RAV4 and drove it to over 150,000 miles.  One of the reasons I chose that model was the great gas mileage it got. Great mid-size SUV, that had room for all our stuff on vacation and fit two car seats with plenty of room."
1980, a year ago,5,"We have an older and a newer year model of the camry. They are both comfortable,  get decent gas mileage, easier to maintain,  and are reliable."
1981, a year ago,5,"Toyota’s are nice cars, that last a long time. If you take care of them, they will go for many miles."
1982, a year ago,5,"This is the most reliable car on planet earth. We have had two different 4Runners and they have both been spectacular and so reliable. Our first forerunner lasted 400,000 miles. They don’t make cars like this anymore￼"
1983, a year ago,5,"My Jeep Commander was getting very tired so I had to give in to the monthly payment club :(
The Rav was in my price point so I decided to lease. 
It was my 1st brand new car is 13 years and loved it! 
Great in snow, and has so many safety features! 
2.5 years into my lease and I am getting a wee bored of feeling like a grandmother in my Rav 4 but it served me so well!!"
1984,a year ago,1,Personally never felt safe in that car something always broke on the car and it was only an 08 had to get rid of it because I refused to put a baby in the car.
1985, a year ago,5,I loved my Scion TC. Great car. Beautiful. Reliable. Fast. Spacious. Handled well. Wish they also had a four door model.
1986, a year ago,4,"This was my first car. Reliable and handled decently.  Not very spacious, but it did its job."
1987, a year ago,4,"I drove a manual transmisssion Toyota Celica for about a year. I loved how it handled and it was predate fast. Not very spacious, but it did its job. Reliable."
1988,a year ago,4,I own a 2017 Corolla and love it. Switched from a Hyundai Elantra and would say it is a much better car for the same price range. Elantra required a lot of maintenance where the Corolla has not.
1989, a year ago,5,My mom has only had camrys. She just traded in her 2005 Camry for a 2020 Camry and both were perfect for her. The new camrys are gorgeous and so sleek. I love it!
1990, a year ago,5,"I drive an older version, a 2001, to nanny children in. I have every seat taken with 10+ bags and we still all sit comfortably. Even though it’s older, it still drives very well and the automatic door are still working perfectly!! Only bad thing about this car is the gas mileage, but that’s to be expected with a bigger older car."
1991, a year ago,1,I hated this car.  It was so small and had no leg space in back of the car.  The driver and  front passenger would the only people comfortable in the car.  It is affordable but not worth it in my opinion.
1992, a year ago,5,This car is a really nice car!! It is an electric car very luxurious as well as very convenient and need no improvement very cool! It’s a little more on the expensive side! All you need is a little battery life charge it up and your good to go!!
1993, a year ago,5,"This car hauls like a truck but is still a car. It’s durable, reliable and fun to drive. I use it for running errands and my DIY projects. It has been my workhorse through the years. The best part is that it’s very affordable. It gets great gas mileage which has been a huge relief."
1994, a year ago,5,"I love my RAV 4. My lease ended this July (2020), but due to COVID, I decide to just extend my lease, but I think I would have done so even if there wasn’t a pandemic going on. I love my car! Great on gas, not too big, and SAFE!"
1995, a year ago,4,"Great car, it is very tiny but a good car for a beginning. Excellent on gas which is amazinggg!"
1996, a year ago,5,Absolutely LOVE this car. I will be driving it until it dies. It rides so smooth and haven’t had any serious problem.
1997, a year ago,4,"Nice little car my family rented on vacation. Is roomy despite smaller size, great on gas, and really enjoyed someone of the newer features like back up camera. Would be great for a younger couple or small family."
1998, a year ago,3,I mean come on it's a Toyota! Toyotas are awesome cars!! this one is great if you live in the mountains and have a lot of curtain roads this little buddy will just hug the curves like it's not pain.
1999, a year ago,3,"Toyota's overall are excellent cars. They get  great gas mileage, they last a long time, and they're just really great cars. Issue is I hate the shape of this car I just think it's funny looking, that's all"
2000, a year ago,5,"I have the sports edition which is absolutely amazing! It drives really well around curves and corners, you get great gas mileage, and there's not many issues with it at all."
2001, a year ago,4,This is always going to one of my favorite cars. It had great gas mileage it drove wonderful and it overall was just an awesome car
2002, a year ago,5,Best car I’ve ever owned. So good on gas and spacious. One tank of gas could last me over two weeks. They are very reliable and worth every Penny!
2003, a year ago,5,Love my Camry! It is incredibly reliable! I’ve had mine for about 8 or so years and it’s been awesome! The perfect starter car that will take you through college and into your first few years as an adult!
2004, a year ago,3,"I love Toyota, so I might as well let that be known first. I generally don't have many problems with my Toyota's and they seem to last me well over 200,000 miles. I wanted a Sequoia for many years and was so completely stoked when I actually bought myself one. Now I just want to upgrade my Sequoia to a new model."
2005, a year ago,5,I think it nice but not if you have children. Its more of a go out car.  Cons it kind of hard to get into if you have some arthritis. no its pretty nice good on gas.
2006,a year ago,5,"me gusta bastante manejar este modelo porque es super económico, ya que el motor no consume mucho. Y además los cambios no son tan duros como en otros carros, para una mujer que lo necesita día a día está super recomendado. "
2007, a year ago,5,"I did not have bread because I do not have a driver's license, but my husband had a Toyota Corolla, he admired it, it is such a comfortable car that you just can not not love"
2008, a year ago,5,"Well first off my mom owns this vehicle and let me tell you I love it, it so fast and good and gas and feels extremely safe to drive. I feel as of now the product need no improvement it's great the way it is. And I would definitely recommend to family and friends looking for a reliable vehicle"
2009, a year ago,4,"I drive a 2013 Toyota Rav4 and it's amazing. At times I feel a lack of space compared to Hyundai Santa Fe and even Honda CRV but this one is better in performance and reliability. 
The sport mode makes you feel you are driving some powerful vehicle and on the other side, eco mode is also not bad in driving. I would recommend it for family usage."
2010, a year ago,4,"I have been impressed with my Highlander. The third row has proven beneficial for unexpected guests, or having visitors to town and allowing us to travel in one car. The only reasons it doesn’t get a 5 star is it uses a lot of gas."
2011, a year ago,5,"Best vehicle I have ever owned! Drove like a dream, even in snow, and was very luxurious. It held seven people comfortably, and love the moveable middle row, to make a side lane in can, instead of down the middle."
2012, a year ago,4,The rav4 is fairly new to me. My wife drives it most of the time. The redesign looks way better than the older models. It’s fun fast and can fit into tight spots.
2013, a year ago,4,My Corolla was great. I’m in construction and I treated that little car like a truck. I drove that car for 200k miles. the only reason I don’t have it now because I got in an accident and it was totaled.
2014, a year ago,4,"I love my car. She’s a little older at a 2007, but she’s pretty sturdy. It’s big enough that I don’t have to worry about not fitting all of my stuff for college. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a larger suv that’s reliable!"
2015, a year ago,5,"Muy buen carro, muy liviano, además de ser hermoso por fuera, también lo es por dentro, los repuestos se consiguen en todos lados. No mejoría nada."
2016, a year ago,3,"Great mileage, but not a car for winter weather.While I felt good about the environment, I did not feel safe on icy roads."
2017,a year ago,1,"To be clear: this is not a review of the reliability of Toyota vehicles. In general, my past experience has been perfect and I have never had an issue with my Toyota vehicles. Instead, this is a review of my experience thus far as it pertains to Toyota's lack of any effort to get my brand new truck fixed. Type in ""toyota refuses to fix under warranty"" on YouTube to hear the noise my truck makes. First video.

I purchased this 2020 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off Road in July and it now has around 10,000 miles. I have had a pretty severe starting hesitation problem has been happening since around mid September. I have brought the truck in five separate times to two separate Toyota dealerships and they have continually told me that they cannot duplicate the issue despite me explaining EXACTLY when and why it happens. I was advised by my Toyota Corporate Customer Care Case Manager to bring the truck in and show them the issue myself; so that's what I did. When I started it up in front of the master technician and it made the same terrible startup noise, he pretended nothing was wrong and insisted that it is by design. He even went as far as to tell me that it sounds like it is in vapor lock which is by design for this truck and is common on more modern vehicles. I told him that he is simply lying because vapor lock is not EVER a design feature, that it is an even less common occurrence on modern direct injection vehicles, and that it is a symptom of a bigger problem with the engine. He told me that he had hooked up a diagnostic tool and it revealed no issues and therefore Toyota cannot do anything about it. He stated that they won't do any further diagnostic work on it because Toyota does not pay them to do diagnostic work unless they can confirm something is wrong. So I told them that I have done many hours of my own research on the problem and have narrowed it down to only a few main culprits and if they can't take the time to diagnose, then maybe they can just replace the parts that are very likely to be causing the issue. I even provided case numbers of other people who have had the *exact* same issue with their trucks (w/ video proof) and the cases document exactly what was tried and what was replaced. They still said they couldn't do anything and both the service advisor and the master technician were extremely rude. So I called the Toyota Case Manager(s) and spoke to them about my case that has been open for several months now and they continually attempt to avoid doing any legitimate work with the excuse that ""it needs to be confirmed as an issue first"". I asked them how they can pretend that these videos are not indicative of a problem and they simply asked me to send them the videos which I have already done prior. I then asked how they are supposed to confirm that something is wrong if the dealership refuses to diagnostic work to diagnose that something is wrong. I even offered to pay to have a private shop diagnose the problem and then bring it back to Toyota to fix, to which they told me that Toyota won't accept outside diagnostic results as legitimate. Currently I am waiting on a call back from Toyota Corporate that is supposed to come within the next three business days. I am not trying to bash Toyota (I have recommended them at every single opportunity that I can: My family owns six of them currently and two others previously) I am simply trying to get this out there to hopefully get the attention of Toyota and get them to do the work that should be done to get my truck running properly.
"
2018, a year ago,5,Is very good is actually the one i am driving I drive everyday and is a very good car I love it I ad I t for 4 years already and I am happy to have it
2019, a year ago,5,Is very good I had my corolla for 16 year and I am happy with it I only change oil filters and put water and never had serious problems
2020, a year ago,5,This is a great smaller SUV. It still has plenty of room and great for travel and small groups.
2021, a year ago,3,Not my preferred car of choice. It drives smooth but doesn’t have a lot of space. I would personally not purchase
2022, a year ago,5,"The Toyota C. Is a great car. It has all the essentials you'll need. A/c stays cold. Great sound system, sleek design. The price is honestly a bit high for some of the models. It does have some cheap plastic parts here and there but if you can overlook that you will probably fall in love with the T.C. This car does need to be well maintained as goes with any other vehicle."
2023, a year ago,5,The car drives beautifully and it sits solid on the road. Is has a sportive look but yet classy. Interior everything at your fingertips and when you sit you feel nicely fitted as the seat holds you nice and firm.
2024, a year ago,5,Drives very smooth and lasts for so many years without any issues. Was my first car ever thanks to my dad. Always dependable and close to my heart.
2025, a year ago,5,I love my car!! I was hesitant at first but I knew it was for me! I love everything about it except my screen on the dash the bottom right part buttons stopped working. That’s the only thing that needs improvement
2026, a year ago,4,My husbands care is the Toyota Camry Hybrid.  Gas mileage is crazy good.  The car is so quiet that people don’t hear it and walk out in front of you.  Very roomy.
2027, a year ago,4,My sister owned a Camry and the car drives very smooth! She and he husband have had the car for almost 5 years now and has had no problems with it so it is definitely seeming to be a reliable car especially since she commutes for work 5 days a week!
2028, a year ago,5,"Perfect for family with 2 kids it’s big enough but not too big so it’s easy to drive and park , only thing I wish there was a little more space between front and back sit due to kids car sits."
2029,a year ago,5,"I lovvvve my Toyota Camry, I have a 2007 XLE. It is very reliable, the gas price you have to put in to fill it is very low! And this car works perfectly in great condition. I love how smooth it drives!"
2030, a year ago,5,My husband bought me this SUV when our kids were still living at home. It was such a nice smooth ride I absolutely loved my Sequoia. I will probably buy another one when we start having grandkids.
2031, a year ago,1,Me gusta este carro la velocidades el espacio que tiene a tras y adelante y también el espacio de la caguela
2032, a year ago,4,Was not a fan of the car. It was an older model that boyfriend had and I just found the car to be extremely uncomfortable to ride in.
2033, a year ago,5,This car is absolutely great for mileage. When I go to the station it fills up with and $15. A couple pros are the gas mileage and little features like keyless entry and push to start. Some cons are they are not fast but you give that up for efficiency.
2034, a year ago,5,"I’ve been wanting a bigger SUV, and this one always catches my eye. I love how roomy it is on the inside, and it’s not super fancy."
2035, a year ago,4,"Cheap, gets you from A to B and has some sporty extras like mobile phone integration but ultimately lacks the power of other cars. It’s easy to park, and probably the best of the cheap city cars (we’re  excluding the Europeans like Fiat or Minis) but as someone who likes cars with personality, I personally prefer a sedan or sports car over hatchbacks. Would suit someone as their first ‘new’ car, or a second car."
2036, a year ago,4,"Good, reliable. Sporty. Doesn’t have the guts of it’s sister the Camry but gets you where you need to go, has decent basic inclusions and great value. These cars go and go and are easy to get parts and decent servicing for them but aren’t super trendy, more of a responsible car."
2037, a year ago,5,"Reliable, although a bit basic. Great for safety. Just won’t die. My car is up to over 300,000km and my mechanic says it still has another 100,000 to go on it. 

Much nicer to drive than a lot of cars but seats are made for a mans shape so a little uncomfortable. 

You may need to replace the windows as the electronics in them goes at about 200kms (happened on both my car and moms car). Mechanics also Re known to try to get you to change the engine mounts (I’ve had them tell me they need replacing twice in 2 years). I’ve also had problems with the brake Calipers needing replacing. However these are the only main issues I’ve had."
2038, a year ago,5,"Very reliable economical car it is very good on gas(Fuel), maintence and repairs were very affordable "
2039, a year ago,5,Very comfortable and has all the bells and whistles in it. Very modern. Extremely dependable. Very smooth ride. 
2040, a year ago,5,I loved my Camry so much! I had a 1999 and the only reason I got rid of it was because I had to (long story).
2041, a year ago,5,I can't afford this car and this car is a very leisure car pricey has everything you need in it the pros are it's a nice looking car and the cons are I can't afford it
2042, a year ago,5,A older model but very reliable. Great gas mileage. Kids fit perfectly. Trunk space perfect
2043, a year ago,5,Great car. Lasts a long time. Doesn’t need to fill up on gas so often and cheaper on fuel cost.
2044, a year ago,3,Smaller than the 4 runner but still not great on gas. Fairly roomy which is nice and has good storage space.
2045, a year ago,3,Literally so huge I felt like I was driving a bus. Great for storage and carrying a lot of stuff but not great on gas.
2046, a year ago,4,"Good gas mileage, nice back up camera, but it is a lot smaller than a Honda Civic which depending on your preference can be good or bad"
2047, a year ago,3,Got as a rental car for a trip up to NH. It was okay...  not a big car person but the blue tooth and back facing camera was nice. Felt like the middle console was situated weird and felt like there were a lot of blind spots.
2048, a year ago,4,"I LOVE my Prius. Granted, I get picked on so much for driving one which makes no sense to me. Maybe they're jealous of my FANTASTIC gas mileage (and the fact that I pay $20 a month for a full tank)? Lol. But really, great car. I just wish it did better in the snow (it's kinda low so I get stuck a lot - which may make me sound like a bad driver but when I drive vehicles that are more lifted, it doesn't happen..). But this is a fantastic summer car! You can't beat that gas mileage.  "
2049, a year ago,5,"Excellent crash rating. Unfortunately proven by an accident I sustained in which the cab of my Tacoma was never breached when my truck hit another vehicle; totaling my Tacoma. It protected me so well I went out immediately and bought me another. In addition,  Tacoma's always have a great resell value so you will never have to worry about getting the most money when you trade-in for the newer model."
2050,a year ago,5,Be if by first cars. Reliable. Good for someone just look for a car! I’m not too fond of the body type but still an overall great car
2051,a year ago,5,My favorite car. It’s gorgeous inside and out. Love the speed & also love the body. It says grown but fun 🤩
2052,a year ago,5,"Very reliable, easy on gas & fast! 🤩 I love that it’s cute and sporty but I’m not a huge fan on two doors."
2053, a year ago,5,My friend drives a 2014 Toyota Camry fully loaded and I love to drive that car. It’s great on gas and the interior is nicer for an American made car.
2054, a year ago,5,Amazing car! Probably one of the only sedans I will purchase. Such a reliable and upscale car! I’ve had two brand new camrys!
2055, a year ago,5,Absolutely love my 4runner! It’s been my dream car for as long as I can remember! Feels so safe and MPG for an suv is not bad at all!
2056, a year ago,5,"It may be small for my tastes, but it is spacious, the car is very good and the maintenance is very good since you don't have to do it eventually. It is also perfect for going out with the family, very good car, very good brand Perfect to travel the world hahaha, it is very economical."
2057, a year ago,5,"It is very comfortable, very spacious, perfect to go on a family outing anywhere you want, except to explore under the sea haha, since it is all-terrain and everything comes well included, it is a perfect car there is no doubt, when you drive it is nice to ride the roads at all"
2058, a year ago,5,Love my car. Super dependable. Mine is a 97 with 60k miles and going strong. Only problem is back lights occasionally stop working because they leak. Trunk a little leaky. But at 24 yrs thats ok!
2059, a year ago,4,"Overall, this car is of great quality and can get expensive. I have a 2015 and it’s a basic model (bummer). The horsepower has slowed tremendously! I keep the oil changed and parts up to date. The maintenance is starting to get expensive for it to be a regular car. However, I recommend this car for a student going off to college and need a reliable car."
2060, a year ago,4,"Ive had many cars in my life and I’ve only owned this one for a short while.  I’ve had minimal problems so far so knock on wood she will keep performing for me.  The interior is great and stylish.  It’s a 4-door so great for driving around the kids.   I had actually drove a Hummer before this, but I really like the transition to a smaller car now that the kids are growing up."
2061, a year ago,4,"Toyota Corolla 2009 CE was my fist vehicle. I loved it so much. Good body and comfortable inside. It really saved oil, especially I drove 100km every day to work. Toyota is always my first choice whenever I considered to have a new vehicle."
2062,a year ago,4,"I have two Toyota Camrys in the Fam plus a highlander. I think Toyota can generally be easy financially. I like the reliability, it’s comfortable, easy to use. Our old models last quite a long time if it’s taken care of and if it need tweaks there’s  accessibility to parts."
2063,a year ago,2,"It’s reliable, cheap to maintain, and drives good. Although, the sound system isn’t the best. I put it on the highest volume because the sound is so low quality. The infotainment system is also low quality."
2064,a year ago,5,"My family personally has a Toyota Highlander. It’s reliable, practical, easy on gas, lasts long, and cheap to maintain. I can’t name anything negative may be because personal preference, but some people may have other preferences."
2065, a year ago,5,"The Camry I had lasted a very long time. They run great and get great gas mileage, especially when traveling.  And their engines seem to last forever."
2066, a year ago,5,I loved my Toyota Forerunner it was a great vehicle. I could transport things if I needed to. Plenty of seating for the kiddos. And the engine ran like a dream and Toyota engines seem to last forever.  Toyota 4Runner
2067, a year ago,5,Honestly ok I have a toyota rav4 BUT it's a 2000. I've had her for over 2 years now she runs AMAZING that thing is a TANK good job toyota I'm a hard driver and this car has lasted me through a lot of things. Not expensive on parts. Such a worth it car lol even if it is 20 years old.
2068, a year ago,5,My husband just purchased a 2020 TRD and we absolutely love it! We love how it has adaptive cruise and apple car play. There is so much space for our dogs! And the car is amazing off road.
2069, a year ago,5,"You cannot go wrong with a Toyota Camry! Those cars are built to last! This 2001 was purchased brand new and is rarely driven, only to the grocery store basically and is garage kept. She is roomy on the inside. My 6’3” husband can drive her with no problem as far as leg room. Although it’s 19, almost 20 years old, it has just hit the 100,000 miles on the odometer, but it still runs like a dream! My husband has always said that Toyotas make Lexus and we all know what an excellent caliber of a car a Lexus is. I believe as long as you take care of your Toyota, it’ll take care of you—I stand by that!! "
2070, a year ago,5,"  Toyota camry el mejor carro del planeta tierra por su la manera que fue construido, sus velocidades los suave es como estar manejando en las nubes"
2071, a year ago,5,"Security in the form of a car/SUV. Reliable even after 299,000 miles. Well known for being safe."
2072, a year ago,4,Has more room than I expected for a small size SUV. Not noisy interior. Comfy seats. Didn't feel all the bumps in the road.
2073, a year ago,4,Not really a practical car bugs it’s pretty and fast and is really nice with the ladies. I had a friend with one and they loved it. 
2074,a year ago,4,"This car although small was very spacious. The A/C ran great. Very reliable for road trips, didn't waste too much gas, all in all it was a good car. I would recommend it to anyone who likes small but spacious cars. It gave me no problems whatsoever during the period I owned it, and I would purchase it again if I could."
2075, a year ago,5,My husband I have leased 5 Rav 4s in the past 8 years. We love them. I think they just keep getting better with each remodel.
2076,a year ago,5,quisiera este carro para poder lucirlo con mi papá manejarlo como se vería por dentro sentarme tomarme fotos más que todo para mis hermanos por que somos 7 hermanos y quisiéramos pasear en ese carro que es muy grande y entraríamos todos y no nos empujariamos en los carros
2077, a year ago,5,Large car in regards to other similar type four door sedans.  Creative storage. Ideal for a little get-around car
2078, a year ago,5,Love this cat it’s big and classic! Enough room for a whole family... state of the art style.
2079, a year ago,4,"Overall great car. It’s a low car so be careful when you’re driving near flooded streets. But the structure is great, giving a decent amount of space in the car for 5 passengers not crowded. The trunk can hold a lot too."
2080, a year ago,5,Toyota Highlander 2014... likes it so much I got a 2020 one as well! Grey power@and space.
2081, a year ago,5,"It is a super car, which is too elegant and beautiful, I would like you to use it and learn more about the brand and models"

2084,a year ago,5,Love this car! I have it for almost 8 years now! It didnt give me any big problems! Con would be the back up camera stopped working and it kinda sucks and toyota told me i can only bring it to the location were i bought it to get fixed ... but over all... this is a reliable and safe car to have!
2085,a year ago,4,I love my RAV4! It has everything I need to haul around my two grandsons. I love how it handles on the highway and how much room it has. It’s a great price for this vehicle! I’d recommend it to anyone out there! Toyota RAV4
2086, a year ago,3,"Otimo carro, tive o modelo 2006. So tenho a agradecer pq me levou pra varios lugares, varias viagens e sem dar nenhum defeito. Infelizmente os modelos antes de 2011 tem um problema com óleo. Passou de 160k, o oleo começa a queimar muito rapido. Quando o meu bateu 170k, eu tive que colocar 2 litrinhos de oleo dentro de 2 semanas. Tive que trocar de carro, pq nao dava pra continuar assim. Mas assim ne, toyota sempre vai ser um carro maravilhoso aqui, principalmente na neve"
2087, a year ago,5,I have owned this car for about 3 years and use it daily. I have a  long commute every day and find it very comfortable and sometimes I have to wait in the car for about an hour for my son and i am able to sit comfortably. My kids have never complained about our car or about space.
2088, a year ago,3,I do not like the inside of this car. It’s very bland. If you are looking doe a gas saver this car will do just that! But if you want a gas saver that’s easy on the eyes and absolute comfort I wouldn’t get this.
2089, a year ago,5,"▲ Yes, I have driven a toyota rav4, I consider it a very elegant and smooth car to drive, you do not feel the speed and it is super comfortable inside it is spacious and its seats with good ergonomic design"
2090, a year ago,5,I own a 2005 highlander that was bought new. It has been the most reliable car ever. I never have any issues with it and the upkeep is inexpensive. When it finally fails I will definitely be buying another one.
2091, a year ago,5,"have had a very good experience driving this car, don’t break down easily which is the best part if you need a very good car at a good price"
2092, a year ago,5,this is the best car i’ve had so far. i love every single part of and all of the great features it has. if you’re looking for a good car this is your car and i definitely recommend it to everyone
2093, a year ago,5,I borrowed my father-in-law’s Sequoia and didn’t want to give it back! It’s definitely in the running for my next car purchase!
2094, a year ago,5,"So so reliable. We’ve had ours for 6 years and have never had an issue. I also commute over a hour each way to work, and it’s never gave me an issue."
2095, a year ago,5,"An excellent car, very economical the only problem is that it is small it doesn’t have much space inside but for a small family he is perfect"
2096, a year ago,5,The best car ever. I bought my car in 2010 brand new and it’s never given me any problems. It gets me to where I need to be.
2097, a year ago,4,"I love this brand, it is too good, the quality of their products are sensational, and they are at a good price.  I recommend these products to everyone.
Yes, I would recommend it 100%, it is very reliable.

it would be an honor for me to represent this brand"
2098, a year ago,5,I bought a 2016 and 2020 Corolla and both are perfect. I would love if I could buy Corollas for the rest of my life. Very easy to drive and very comfortable.

2100, a year ago,5,It’s a very roomy car. It pretty much is very smooth. Like it’s nothing new but it does take me to the places i need. So far I hope it will last me longer.
2101, a year ago,5,I love it!  it gets great mileage and it’s so quiet when it’s on. The only think I don’t like is the beeping noise when I back up. It’s a little pricey but so worth it!! I’d highly recommend.
2102,a year ago,5,automóvil muy cómodo demasiado accesible me encanta ya que si quieres ir de viaje de compras es demasiado accesible  lo recomiendo bastante compre este gran automóvil no te vas a repetir 
2103, a year ago,5,Love Toya! That’s what I call my Prius🤓 We have clocked nearly 100k miles together over the years. She’s seen many parts of the country and does so well.
2104, a year ago,5,One of the most relaxing and cheap car to own!! The gas is cheap and the insurance is cheap? I highly recommend it to new drivers who just got their license!! It also depends if you have a v6 or a 4 cylinder cat
2105, a year ago,5,It is a very reliable car. It has good gas mileage. It's comfortable. I haven't had any problems with it. I would definitely recommend this car to anybody. It's safe for my kids. It's safe for me as well. The parts are cheap. It has wonderful gas mileage.
2106, a year ago,5,"I switched from a 2004 Camry to a 2010 Prius Sport. The Prius definitely drives a lot better than my previous car, saves on gas, and looks so much better. After this car dies eventually, I plan on buying a new Prius. I feel so much safer in this vehicle too."
2107, a year ago,4,This car is a great transition from a sedan to something a bit bigger without making a huge jump!
2108,a year ago,5,"My second home, the best car I ever had in my life, I have a blue edition Yaris hybrid, how I can review my car? easy to drive, comfortable, green and with a touch of sport drive mode, love Toyota assistance too!"
2109,a year ago,5,"I think this model of SUV has always been ahead of its time. It is so advanced, compared to its rivals, that it surely features characteristics which we will see in this segment for years to come, no doubt."
2110, a year ago,5,Love Toyota been a few different models they ride smooth but you have to order the parts if you ever need to replace something. Fairly affordable and run forever! I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who wants a good running long lasting vehicle.
2111, a year ago,5,My car is legit the best. 20$ every 3 weeks to fill up! Truly can’t complain! I hope to never get rid of this car!
2112, a year ago,5,"Toyota in general are amazing cars they run forever and are easy to repair. Pros they run for days, cons you almost always have to order the parts because they are readily available in the auto parts store. I have driven a Toyota since I began driving and I will always. They have been great for me."
2113, a year ago,5,I had a toyota yaris 2008 and I loved this car. This was one of my best cars. It was the best for parking and gas.
2114, a year ago,5,I love my Rav4. This is a very comfortable and spacious suv. It is extremely comfortable and works really well in the snow. The price is very affordable and when I purchased it I got 0% interest. I would recommend this suv to everyone.
2115, a year ago,5,"I love my RAV4. It’s exactly what I needed ! It’s so comfortable to drive in , super quiet and has the zooms you want !! Definitely affordable:) highly recommend"
2116, a year ago,5,"We got our Highlander used with under 100,000 miles it's a 2005. I can't believe it's still running great. The only items we had to replace were the tires. Not even a headlight. The leather seats are still intact  no cracks and no cracks in the dashboard from heat & drying out. The ride is so smooth and drives easy. What I found unique is that it had an ashtray, coil lighter, tape deck & CD player. Talk about flashbacks. The only thing I dont like it how the white paint color has dulled & chipped the hood 
We tried so hard to find a white touch paint, even from the dealer but never could come close to a match."
2117,a year ago,4,Great Car and had high mileage good driving car. My issues with it is that the battery cables would not stay on and the sun roof leaked alot

2119, a year ago,4,Nice and comfortable. The technology is very nice and the sound system is really good. Smooth drive overall
2120, a year ago,5,Toyota has been a reliable brand. We have a 2018 Toyota Camry and it's been really nice to us for the past year. It's sleek and the upkeep isn't difficult. The oil changes are synthetic only and some car shops may not have the correct filter on hand at times because it's popularity.
2121,a year ago,5,I love the latest model.  Gas efficient and has great safety features that have allowed me to drive it safely for several hours a day.
2122, a year ago,4,It is a nice looking car and decent for the environment. Or at least I like to think it is and that makes me feel good about driving.
2123,a year ago,4,"I grew up in a family that has a tendency to purchase Toyotas. I have been both passenger and have driven this car in the past. I personally much prefer my Toyota Yaris because I like cars that are a little bit more compact. If you're looking for a standard size sedan oh, this definitely will work for you."
2124,a year ago,5,"I'm small. I like small cars. This one looks small on the outside but you would never think it felt small on the inside. It's reliable, safe and has lasted me a very long time as most Toyota's tend to do. The one Quirk about it is it has a single large windshield wiper blade which can look kind of funny when you pull it up for the winter but it's a small price to pay for such a wonderful car"
2125, a year ago,5,I loved my 2000 Toyota Camry! It was compact and reliable and it perfectly for my needs for a first car. It was only a 4cylinder but it was very good on gas mileage and was relatively inexpensive to upkeep.
2126,a year ago,5,"I am happy to say that I just paid off my RAV4, and I have no intention of trading it anytime soon. It hasn't given me any problems during these past five years, and I don't anticipate any problems in the future. If you keep up with the scheduled maintenance, it will serve you well. The interior space would be plentiful for a family of three or four. Personally, it carries my husband and me along with our furbaby with plenty of room to spare. I can also speak to the longevity of the car. My mother owned an older model of the RAV4 for sixteen years. It would still be driving if it had not been totaled in an auto accident. When it was time for her to get a replacement, she bought another RAV4. If you are looking for a reasonably priced car with good quality that will take you far, look no further than the Toyota RAV4."
2127, a year ago,5,I have owned this vehicle for 7 years now.  It has had no major mechanical issues and gets amazing gas mileage.  It's comfortable abs small and i love my car.
2128, a year ago,5,I had to rent a vehicle to drive up north to our shack and they had given me a 4runner. I feel in love!  It fit all 5 of us adults in there comfortably and all of our bags in the back. It's a 5 hour drive up north and this was the best vehicle and I am so happy we were able to rent it.  I can't wait to drive one of these again!!!
2129, a year ago,5,"My grandfather had leased a this car every 2 years for about 10 years.  He loves it and finally bought his own a few years ago. I have driven it many times and it's a great car!  Very reliable, comfortable,  and good gas mileage."
2130, a year ago,5,Comfort and reliable vehicle begins right here! It is a family friendly vehicle and the ride is a very smooth one
2131, a year ago,5,This was my previous car before I bought my current car. It was a great reliable car for a young commuter. It was comfortable and versatile for my single life. It was reasonable price and if I had done better with regular maintenance it would have lasted longer. 
2132, a year ago,5,"Mi papá lo tueno a tal punto que tenía televisión y sonido envolvente, lamentablemente tuvimos que venderlo pero fue la mejor experiencia, viajar en este auto es súper cómodo."
2133,a year ago,4,It can take me places others can even though its 2wd but in same note its cheaper on gas plus roomy enough to camp out if needed
2134, a year ago,5,Best car ever takes me from A to B with no problems! I never have issues with the car and I definitely recommend anyone to have this as their first car! Super affordable to upkeep and easy to buy all the parts!
2135, a year ago,5,"I love that this is fuel economical. And it’s cute. Easy on gas and the eyes? What more could you want in a car (or a man)? I’ve had mine for nearly ten years, and it’s very dependable. I will continue to buy hybrids!"
2136, a year ago,5,I love my rav. Super reliable and built well. I like that it has a good sound system and the technologies for Bluetooth and all of that. It does take the highest grade oil for oil changes but I don’t mind.
2137, a year ago,3,Great brand strong cars love the interior trusted by many quality cars trustworthy brand
2138, a year ago,5,"I love this car, my one was the 5th generation Celica SX, with the 5sfe engine. For its age it runs very well, It was fairly shaky when idling but was fixed when i replaced all the engine mounts, it ran perfect. The 5sfe is a very torquey engine and is very fun to drive."
2139, a year ago,5,"Used to rent one couple times. Newer models are nice in technology that’s put inside, comfy to use and drive and fuel efficient"
2140, a year ago,5,Love my 2016 Corolla!! I had a Camry prior and almost refused to consider looking at the Corolla because I didn't want to feel like I was in a compact car.. I AM SO GLAD I GAVE IT A CHANCE! Gas mileage is great and it has a beautiful inside! It's even roomier than I thought it would be!  Toyota Corolla
2141, a year ago,5,I have been leasing Toyota Corolla for about 12 years. Gas mileage is excellent. The car handles well in rain and snow. The trunk space is great. You can easily put two 24 in suitcases and 3 or 4 duffel bags in the trunk. The back seat is comfortable and the front seat is also. I like the back up camera but still shoulder check.
2142, a year ago,5,I had a 1997 Corolla until 2014. It was still running when I got a new car. Loved it so much. I don’t know what today’s are like but I know they’re pretty durable. Lexus IS the luxury version of a Toyota. And I just got rid of one that was 20. They seriously go forever.
2143,a year ago,5,"I love my 2009 Toyota Scion. Sadly, they were discountined in 2014. I don't understand why because it's such a stylish and fun car. Very high safety rating, very comfortable to drive and lots of room. Mines a hatchback and I love how much cargo space I have. Fantastic mileage and one of the reasons why I purchased it and also, because it's a Toyota. "
2144, a year ago,5,The best car in the whole world. These cars last over decades! It’s just a regular car with regular maintenance problems. I could even ask for a better car. My mom saved her Toyota just to give it to me. These are the most reliable cars on planet earth most definitely recommend!
2145, a year ago,5,Love my car! This is the most reliable car I’ve ever owned. My Toyota has been there through everything with Me. It has never broken down on me and it’s never been a pain.
2146, a year ago,5,"Our 2007 highlander has over 360,000 miles on it. It has been hands down THE most dependable and I’m pretty sure it’s going to outlast us!"
2147, a year ago,5,Drives good. Was just to small for our family. Great gas mileage and a good ride. If they were just a little bit bigger we would have kept.
2148, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota Corolla.  The best feature is that you can fold in the outside mirrors.
2149, a year ago,5,"It fits my family needs. The size is perfect to fit all my family members. It is fully loaded, has leather sits, tv and navigation. Does not eat too much gasoline."
2150, a year ago,5,"I owned a Toyota 4Runner for years and I can’t say enough great things about this vehicle. It had over 270,000 original miles on it when I sold it and it was still running good. Overall this vehicle never let me down and was so dependable in all weather climates especially snow. I’d definitely buy one again and suggest it to anyone as a fantastic purchase."
2151, a year ago,5,"Love it. It is perfect for my big family, fits easily 8 of us. We love it because it has tv, navigation and big trunk and because it does not use as much gasoline."
2152, a year ago,4,I have loved my Highlander!  The only thing I wish I had gotten with my Highlander was one with a third row seat and the captain seats in the second row.
2153, a year ago,4,It was a very dependable car I'm comfortable to ride in but somewhat small I would probably purchase another one if the situation was correct
2154, a year ago,5,"Great car! Easy to drive & super spacious, the newer model is impressive! Great interior"

The only thing is that it does not has the same revolution as the 2012.  Toyota Motor Company Toyota Yaris"
2156, a year ago,5,Toyota 4Runner runs for log time! Most of these kinds of cars pass 400k miles and continue running. My car only visits a car repair when it needs maintenance and that's all.  The parts are easy to find in most parts stores or online. Recommend this brand and model.

2164, a year ago,5,"I know a lot of people who drive this car. I do not own one but it is just as safe and reliable as my Hyundai. If I could not have gotten a Hyundai, I would have chosen  Toyota."
2165, a year ago,5,I had a 1995 toyota corolla right after high school. It was a dependable car and great on gas. It was enough room for my daughter and I.
2166, a year ago,5,"My husband had a 2008 Toyota matrix that we just recently sold after getting a new vehicle. This is one tough little car. It had over 300,000 and is still going strong. We barely ever had to get it fixed or put any extra money into it. A great low maintenance vehicle"
2167,a year ago,4,"I think this was a decent size vehicle when we had 2 children. But once our 3rd came there was just not enough storage and leg room for our oldest. The gas Mileage was good and body style and look was sporty and updated. However, it did make me realize I love my Yukon XL way better. Sorry 😞  But size, smooth driving and On Star with a family is a must"

Great on gas mileage I have to fill mine up at least once a week and I’m good for the rest of the week depending on how many places I go"

All I've done is the usual oil changes , tire care, and a new battery every 5 years or so. This car has 250,000+ miles and is still a reliable car! I'm so happy with it . Toyota still updates parts of the car that are recalled so I feel like it is very safe. Good gas mileage. Compact so it's easy to park . It's not the most glamorous car or a fancy sports car by any means, but man it is a GOOD car ."

Even with an abundance of research, I still had to stick with a Corolla, there was no way I could have chosen a better car. Even with how bad the crash was, I left without a scratch thanks to my car. Plus, the price and fuel economy of this car is spectacular perks! Toyota is definitely doing it right!"

The latest Camry also comes in my favorite color for a car Aqua Galactic Mica. Depending on the light, the car looks green, blue or black. It’s gorgeous.

It has fold down back seats which help when you buy something that takes up lots of cargo space.I like having the back window defroster and wiper. It has lane departure alerts, lights on the side mirrors for blind spot to detect when a car is in your blind spot. So many things I love, but next time I will probably get a lighter color as dark gray gets pretty hot in summer."

2267, a year ago,4,"I have a 2020 Toyota Corolla LE Nightshade edition and I absolutely love it. This is my 4th Toyota (accident prone) and Toyotas have saved my life on multiple occasions. I get compliments on my car all the time because it looks so sporty, and people are surprised when I tell them it’s a Toyota. It’s extremely affordable and reliable which is why I keep going back. My Corolla is great on gas and drive smooth. My ONLY criticism is that it can be slightly loud when driving. I wish it was just a tiny bit quieter. Never an issue when I’m jamming out though!"
2268, a year ago,5,I have a 2007 silver Camry AE. It’s served me very well for the last 10 years. I plan on buying another Camry when this car is 20 years old.
2269, a year ago,3,"I traded in my Honda CR-V for my highlander thinking it would be the perfect 3rd row suv. I  haven’t liked the highlander since a few days after purchasing it. It doesn’t drive near as smooth as my Honda’s or Volkswagen in the past and it definitely isn’t anymore space than I had in my crv. With 2 kids forward facing in the middle row there is no room whatsoever in the 3rd row. There is no leg room, an adult or big kids would have to twist their feet horizontally just to get them in. I’ve even scooted the kids up as far to the front as possible and it still isn’t a decent amount of space. It is incredibly loud, I have a 2 and 6 year old in the middle row and I can never hear what they are saying. Even with my radio turned down and and the air on low I still can barely hear them, there doesn’t seem to be any type of noise buffer. Plus, my Honda has many more safety and convenience features that come standard. I can’t wait to trade this car in. Toyota may be for some, but not for me or my family."
2270, a year ago,5,"Great car, larger sized sedan is perfect for kids and car seats. Safe and easy to drive. Comfortable and overall an economical vehicle to own."

2273, a year ago,5,Fantastic hybrid car! The gas mileage is amazing! I love everything about this car! The only con is that it is hard on tires. I wouldn't change anything on it. Fairly affordable as I bought it used. I very highly recommend this car! It is the best car I've ever owned!

Comparably to a Nissan Rogue or similar SUVs, I found the RAV4 to be a much smoother ride. Less bumpy and more comfortable.

Backseat is roomy for me (5'0"" petite girl). The only thing ive noticed is that in my brothers', which is only a year or 2 old, the seat didnt seem to want to move forward easily like maybe the battery in it didn't work so well or something and the doors already squeak like its a 1957 Chevy lol and i know he treats it like his baby."
2350, a year ago,4,"Very nice car. It’s comfortable, you can save 2 seat modes (great because me and my boyfriend always share) and it’s very cheap, you can put $27 for gas and drive it all week long. I like how it looks both inside and out (2015 model). The only thing, I have always driven Subaru’s, I feel that the gas/brake pedal is hard, like you need to push it a lot to make you go or stop. Apart from that, I adore this car!"
2351, a year ago,5,The Toyota corolla drives so smooth and gets great gas mileage too!!! The inside is also very ergonomic. The inside is of very high quality. It hasn't had any motor issues and has been very reliable. It does good driving in any weather too! My favorite car
2352,a year ago,5,"Current and likely most favorite personally owned vehicle yet. Safe reliable, a bit lightweight but still surprisingly spacious"
2353,a year ago,5,Love this suv! Great smaller sized suv with all the inside space of a large suv. Awesome leg space back and front storage in the hatch excellent on gas great option!
2354, a year ago,4,Good car but really basic. Slow but reliable. Horrible wheels but who cares about that right?

2357,a year ago,5,I have had toyota almost all my life. This car is good on gas and no matter the mileage which is a lot that I put on it. This car is affordable and last you for a lifetime if you take care of it few problems you will have. I would recommend Toyota if your looking for a car.
2358,a year ago,3,"My dad has a highlander. It’s not my favorite personally and it has some issues, but it’s lasted a while for him."
2359, a year ago,4,"Molto carina; piccola e compatta. L’ho trovata davvero utile per girare in citt@. No. Guido quasi mai, quindi il fatto che fosse cosI agevole, l’ho trovato fantastico!"
2360, a year ago,5,"I love my truck! I've owned my Sequoia for almost 5 years. It has so much room to haul my kiddos and all of their luggage. When we had a doggo we would carry her everywhere in it as well. We love it for long trips. VERY comfy and roomy even for my very tall husband (6'4""). I feel safe in it and it has been very reliable."
2361,a year ago,5,Camrys are reliable as long as you take care of it.  We love Toyota because they are a very reliable car and will last hundreds of thousands of miles.
2362, a year ago,4,This a great compact car choice. I rented 2019 Corolla for couple weeks. It was simple interior and had a lot of new safety features plus a huge dash screen!Toyota Corolla

2366, a year ago,5,I love my car get me every where I need to go with no problem!!!! It is super gas ifficiant! Saves a lot of money. Very spacious car for how little it is. But for it being little its easy to get around tight crowded spaces! Has a good trunk space. And super easy to keep clean.
2367,a year ago,5,"Great car. Nothing flashy but it handles well, feel secure and looks nice. Super reliable and goes and goes. This is my second Camry the last one went over 200,000 miles and was still in great shape!"
2368, a year ago,5,Very nice and reliable car. Toyota is a brand that is very affordable and you can have that car for years. Love them
2369, a year ago,5,Absolutely LOVE this suv! Great gas mileage no problems runs on and on! Toyota is a good brand of car! There isn’t even one complaint I’d buy the exact same car again! It’s awesome!
2370, a year ago,5,I love the size of this van and honestly it’s great for kids. Forever a van owner? Definitely not! But great van for now! The girls don’t door ding the car next to us and plenty of space for all their stuff!
2371, a year ago,5,My stepdad had this car and it’s the one I learned how to drive in. It was a really smooth ride and it was very comfortable for me to learn on. The color he had was gold and it was very beautiful to look at!
2372, a year ago,5,"Me encantan los vehículos 4x4 porque son de buena demanda y resistencia, excelente para todo tipo de terreno, ahorradores de combustible son 10/10 para Toyota"
2373, a year ago,5,"Considero que es un excelente automóvil, suave para manejar, se encuentran rápido los repuestos, súper cómoda y lo mejor de todo es que el combustible tarda bastante, es una excelente inversión para los que buscan un buen carro"
2374, a year ago,4,All the features you want starting at a base model. I test drove this vehicle a month ago and was impressed. I feel like visibility was a con for me though. I had a hard time seeing trying to switch lanes. I feel like price isn’t bad considering all the features you get plus with Toyota’s reliable name. It definitely has great power with the v6 engine. I’m not sure how the hybrid performs since I didn’t drive that one.
2375, a year ago,5,"One of my favourite car been using it for nearly 5 years very smooth to drive, very cheap to repair too."
2376, a year ago,5,"My husband had a 2005 and it’s still running! These cars are built to last you and he loves that about his car! Reliable, and has gotten him across the country safely three times!"
2377, a year ago,4,I enjoyed owning a Highlander at one point in my life. I bought it used when my Civic died a painful death and was glad I did.
2378,a year ago,4,Se encontraba dentro de las opciones para ser uno de mis primeros coches propios. El tamaño y la comida del interior es perfecta para alguien jóven. Pero para mi gusto la conducción era demasiado dura y no tenía la fuerza real que los CV marcaban. 
2379,a year ago,4,"I drive a 2012 model which is very fuel efficient and relatively low maintenance. It does take some effort to accelerate but that is expected for a small engine. The trunk is roomy enough for 1 big shop and the back seats can be collapsed modular. It's my trusty car, I love it."
2380, a year ago,4,"Overall is a great small suv. I just don’t like a few minor things such as can’t see the buttons when it’s dark (they don’t have glow in the dark thingy in them), I don’t like how I have to unlock the car in order to open the back. I don’t like the app, it never works to start my car on my watch or phone (the sole reason I need it) and you have to pay for subscription.  Im not a big fan of heated seat function, it just doesn’t heat up enough, my old Honda Civic was much better at it. I don’t like the automatic high and low beams. Again, it just doesn’t work properly. I do like comfort, fuel economy, easy to navigate, I like the lane assist and cruise control, these two options make it easier to drive long distance. I also like the heated steering wheel function."
2381,a year ago,3,I got to drive it and it was pretty smooth but I like smaller vehicles but overall I think it is a vehicle good for the price
2382,a year ago,5,This is my dream car. I got to drive it and it runs very smoothly and I love how it looks on the outside.
2383, a year ago,5,Toyota is definitely my favorite brand of car. Always reliable have driven them my entire life. Long lasting and definitely great value for your dollar. It’s hard not to perfer Toyota’s when renting a car and I always opt for that brand of car
2384, a year ago,4,"Toyota makes great cars. The Rav4 has a smooth ride and great gas mileage. Easy to see out of and not too big. I would have preferred leather seats, because the fabric gets stains easily. Good auto for the $$."
2385, a year ago,5,I love this car especially as a family car. It’s very spacious and roomy. Great for kids and family trips. Very good on gas as well
2386,a year ago,4,El mejor uufff divino me encanta mucho estos carros el mejor me enamora divino excelente calidad me enamora precioso 💜😍💓
2387,a year ago,5,La mejora excelente divino me enamora hermoso lindo bello wuaooo wuaooo excelente calidad el mejor divino wuaooo wuaooo
2388, a year ago,5,"This is definitely a safe and reliable car for the price. It's more practical than sport, but still cute little ride!! I wouldn't change anything about my car as it's perfect for my basic needs. As long as I keep good upkeep on it this car will last me a long time hopefully. I am grateful to feel safe in this model too. I highly recommend! I'm from Michigan,  so I have never been into foreign made vehicles until I moved down to Florida as it's more common."
2389, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love Camrys! I had one in college and it lasted over 10 years. When it started having issues I wanted to purchase another Camry. They are good in miles, drive smooth, and spacious. I definitely recommend!"

2394,a year ago,3,Older ones seemed like they had a lot of ￼ maintenance that need to be updated. Still a good vehicle to have though. Seems to be pretty popular and a typical suv like the Sante Fe.
2395, a year ago,5,Nice vehicle and has lots room for 4 adults and luggage. Drives great and good value for a vehicle that will run forever- always had lots of luck with Toyota and would definitely recommend. I wish that Toyota would add the extras as standard vice having to pay for upgrade packages
2396, a year ago,5,I dont drive but I do use lyft or uber from time to time and I always get one of these. They are very nice as far as I know. Very roomy. Lots 0f space to spread out. I dont know if its expensive. But I like the way it rides.
2397, a year ago,5,Nice vehicle for full size and has lots of room for 4 adults and tons of trunk space. Drives great and good value for a vehicle that will run forever- always had lots of luck with Toyota and would definitely recommend. I wish that Toyota would add the extras as standard vice having to pay for upgrade packages.
2398, a year ago,5,Nice for a small SUV. Has room for 4 adults but not a lot of trunk space. Drives great and good value for a vehicle that will run forever- always had lots of luck with Toyota and would definitely recommend.

2399, a year ago,5,Great all wheeled drive vehicle for Canadian winters. Handles well and drives well. Mileage is good.
2400, a year ago,5,The best cars out there. We bought this car because Toyota cars last a long time and you don’t see them messing up.
2401, a year ago,4,This is a great car. I had mine for about a year. Nothing ever happen other than my tire kept going flat . I loved my red Toyota Corolla. The motor was great and I traveled many places in in . I ended up selling the car to my uncle
2402,a year ago,5,I love driving this car. The interior is luxurious and the engine is in top shape. It accelerates super fast so you need to be careful. The trip will be smooth because you don't feel the road bumps.

2405,a year ago,5,"I used to own a Toyota Camry Hybrid, I love how economical the car is for mileage. Its easy to drive, with the driving controls in sensible logical areas. The bluetooth / handsfree system works well. However like any handsfree system it picks up some background road noise whilst driving."
2406, a year ago,4,Love this car. It’s soft and really good. I like this car but you need enough money for gasoline. It’s pricey😐 I can’t recommend this caras it’s expensive and it eats too many gasoline so I’m not sure it fits you🤷
2407,a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my car. The console is way more high tech than I need it to be. It tells me the logistics on my car, from the gas mileage I'm getting to when I need to get service. I'm not at all car savvy so having this feature was very nice for me. The eco drive is also a nice feature given how much I drive. I do wish I could afford a hybrid or electric but the gas mileage I do get is very high. It drives smoothly. The only thing I have an issue with is how low to the ground the front bumper is. It's constantly scraping things. Drives me bonkers!"
2408, a year ago,4,Love the back up camera feature and the ability to lay down the seating row. Drives well in snow.
2409, a year ago,5,Love this car! Comfortable ride and all the features I wanted! Hybrid was great on gas and no issues up to 140k miles!

2411, a year ago,5,"Love it! The drive is so smooth, it’s good on gas. And the maintenance on it is low, we hardly have to take it in for major work. They can be expensive depends on year/ make and model. I have a 2011 and it’s been going strong for us for years now. These are good cars, I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice car"
2412, a year ago,5,The Corolla will always be one of my favorite cars due to the easy  maneuver of driving and interior design. It was my first car and definitely brings me happiness.
2413,a year ago,5,This car is my favourite and very comfy and relaxing and when i am going to somewhere i love to drive this car when my own car
2414, a year ago,3,"hybride, comfortable. It's pricier than some newcomers, but it has a decent spec, plus its cabin is spacious and there's plenty of boot space, which makes it a viable family car."
2415, a year ago,4,"Well it's a fine care to ride. It has enough space for almost 5 people. I like this care because of its size, you will always find a parking spot."
2416, a year ago,5,My husband drives the '19 Toyota Camry...if have a need for speed then this is the car for you...it has both manual and automatic gear options...it's wide and spacious on the inside...only downfall for me is that there is no CD player witin the car...pretty need a smart phone to operate the maon features.
2417, a year ago,5,I've had my '19 Corolla for a lil over a year...it's great on gas and runs smooth...it's as simple as that 😊

I’ve had mine for 7 years now, over 120K miles on it and still running like a beast. I push the car to extreme, be it rain, snow, shine the car does not disappoint. Hope they keep making them like this, with power, stability and control."
2423,a year ago,5,"Este auto es HERMOSOOOO, es muy espacioso, realmente quiero uno asiiii, he tenido la oportunidad de utilizar uno de estos y me encantaaaaa"
2424, a year ago,5,"Love this care so much. I got this car almost 15 years ago and it is still in great shape and drives amazing.

2432, a year ago,5,Love this vehicle. Lots of space and storage. Good options and realizable. Recommend over and over
2433, a year ago,5,My camry has been very reliable until a certain person started messing with it and it was not the best decision this person has made since I needed to drive it roughly 40 miles a day.
2434, a year ago,5,"This is the car I learned to drive with at my driving school. I like it, it’s a good size. Definitely would consider getting this car when I buy my first car. The brakes were a little messed up on the exact car I was using but could just be a wear and tear issue."
2435, a year ago,5,I have a 2007 Corolla and I love my car! I keep up with the maintenance and love the durability.

2439,a year ago,4,"Love this car very comfortable and spacious. Plenty of room for storage and drives/parks easily. The only thing that we have trouble with is the tired pressure/light. The light is always turning on, tired pressure is low, we put air in the tires and then it’s back on again. We have had this same issue with another Toyota in the passed so it seems to be a Toyota thing. Too bad because everything else works great!"

If you get a special model it could have a Lexus engine too so check under the hood 😉! Very sturdy car, good for a family too, has the leg room and room for car seat & the diaper bag too with room to give. Definitely don’t feel cramped at all in a Camry for being a sedan. "

2481, a year ago,5,Best car I’ve ever driven. All the features are fantastic and it drives so well! I was also rear ended in it and didn’t even really know if I was hit or not. Super safe vehicle. Hands down my favorite vehicle on the market.
2482, a year ago,4,"I love my 4Runner! It is ￼ reliable, safe, and and easy to maintain. Has a big blind spot though! I have had mine since college."
2483, a year ago,5,"This car is a beast and you truly get your money out of it. Family vacations, car pool, and moving this car offers it all. It has so much space and drives very smooth. Being a v8 it gets up and goes, especially for how big it is. This is a vehicle you truly feel safe in and I have never had any problem with it, even at 200+k miles. Gas mileage isnt great but that's a given for the size."
2484,a year ago,5,Rented the S edition....fun car to drive. Comfortable and great on gas. Wish I’d have been able to have it longer.
2485, a year ago,4,"my husband drives one of these and it looks cute on the outside, but I feel like it doesn't offer enough space because of how big it is  Toyota 4Runner"

2487, a year ago,4,"My husband owns a new 2019 Toyota Camry. It's comfortable to sit in and has a ton of room in the back/trunk. I so wish the screen was easier to read when the sun hits it, but I'm not sure there is anything that can be done for that."
2488, a year ago,5,Best SUV/ vehicle I have ever owned! I told my husband after purchasing my dream car that I will never own another vehicle that is not a 4Runner. Goes in the snow and every possible climate you can think of! Great family care with 3rd row and plenty of leg room. 
2489, a year ago,5,A friend has an old version of this car and that thing has lasted her through everything. She drives it across California every few months and it runs great. She plans to upgrade next year to a newer version of the same car!
2490, a year ago,5,"This was my first car. It was a 2005 Corolla S. I loved it! It was safe, reliable, and lasted me 15 years! It got me where I needed to go, and did so safely. I highly recommend this car for anyone. Toyota’s are timeless and reliable, and affordable!"
2491,a year ago,4,It was a smooth ride. Didn’t look like I had too much problems when it came to Maintenance.

2493, a year ago,4,My van has never let me down.   Toyota by far is the best van that I have ever owned.  It is roomy and has tons of trunk area space for groceries. My husband even piles in three bikes and 3 kids to go to the park with room to spare.
2494, a year ago,5,My sister drives this SUV and I’m obsessed. It’s such a great size. All the features that it offers makes driving long distances so easy. I love the speed match feature.
2495, a year ago,5,Absolutely LOVE these cars. The new ones are absolutely stunning inside in out. I’m unsure of the price but I’m assuming it isn’t awful. They also get really great gas mileage which I always look for in a car!
2496, a year ago,5,This is literally one of the best cars. My sister and I shared a Camry in high school and I love it! The car was indestructible. It held up through everything. I also loved how simple the maintenancing of it was. ￼￼I could go anywhere since there was nothing overly fancy about the construction of it any mechanic was able to work on it. Parts for the car were also really easy to find so we could do some of the repairs at home ourselves. ￼
2497, a year ago,4,Is really nicei like it is very affordable on my sight it has a good radio sound integrated and does the job for a ride and keep my ears busy and a good ride

2505, a year ago,3,"I drove a blue 2011 Toyota Corolla as my first car in high school. It was super affordable and got great gas mileage, making it perfect as a teenager! At the time, I was living in a very humid part of Florida that was known for it's heavy rains. Over a short period of time of owning the car, the paint of the roof completely rusted, but the paint on the rest of the car was fine, making it look a little funky the last few years I owned it."

2512, a year ago,4,Good car. Fun to drive. Low maintenance. Didn’t ever have many issues when I owned mine. Can be a little noisy when sitting inside and driving down the road.
2513, a year ago,5,My husband drives a brand new Camry and it is super safe and full of cool technology. It has lane assist so if you start to doze and cross the line it drives you back into your lane. It has automatic high beams. This car is great!

2525, a year ago,5,Cómodo con espacios amplios y para una familia completa de 7 personas incluso para mí es una sensación muy práctica y muy fácil de manejar por lo que para las personas se les va a ser más fácil si tienen Este modelo puede ser que a mí me gusta la dirección hidráulica que por eso lo recomiendo es muy suave y fácil
2526,a year ago,5,For the first time in my life I bought a brand new car. This car is so amazing. Its a 7 seater with lots of leg space and cargo space.  Seats fold down to make a huge trunk space.
2527,a year ago,5,"To be honest I never really thought I would imagine myself in a matrix but after having it and realizing how comfortable it is to drive it, the amount of space I have in it, It's definitely very roomy especially if you have to move a lot of stuff. It's great on gas mileage and it drives really smooth. I've never had any kind of problems at all with toyota vehicles . "

2532,a year ago,5,I love my Toyota. It's new and the safety features are amazing. Cons were the prize pros everything else about it. They are always improving in every way. It was expensive but you get what you pay for in a car. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking!
2533, a year ago,5,I’ve had my car for about 6 years now and it has not given me any problems! Thank god lol
2534, a year ago,5,If saving money and the environment are your thing the Prius is an awesome vehicle for that.  I have the Prius C and it fits in any spot and is zippy and fast.  I love how little it costs at the gas pump. This Prius has never given me a reason to have to go into the shop other then routine oil changes! I highly recommend it.
2535,a year ago,3,"Bought second hand. Loved it because it was my first car - small and easy to drive but with enough space in the boot for my needs. However, increasingly faced issues with it in terms of brakes etc. This may be due to the fact that its an old model though!"
2536,a year ago,5,I love this compact fuel efficient vehicle.  I would not replace it for the world.  It drives nicely and is very steady and I feel I am able to keep control easier due to its size and easy handling.  It is very affordable and I do recommend this car.  Love!

2538, a year ago,4,Very reliable type of car. Repair usually doesn’t cost to much since Toyota isn’t an expensive Brand of Car.
2539, a year ago,5,My previous car was a Toyota Corolla. It was 2 years old when I bought it and it lasted me 14 years. The whole time I owned it I never had to do any major work to besides the occasional tune up and getting the tires changed other then that it was such a good strong reliable car. Loved it.
2540, a year ago,4,"Good car! Very roomy and spacious. Runs well, good on gas and overall a decent vehicle"
2541, a year ago,4,"I love this car, I have the scion Tc in 2011 and it has a hatch back trunk. For a coupe it’s very spacious. Good for people who live on their own, the back seats fold down so if moving normal size furniture it works."

2543, a year ago,2,"I don’t like how low the car is, too close to the ground for me, play the one I was in was really old."
2544, a year ago,5,This is a great family van. For when you have a bigger family and more kids. It is very convenient and easily accessible for example the sliding side doors.
2545, a year ago,5,One of the best cars I’ve used. It belonged to my mother and she had it for 10 years. Great performance for a great price. It saved a lot in gas bills and was super low maintenance. I do believe the new model looks a bit weird for me but I guess that is not such a big problem.
2546, a year ago,5,I love this car. It does not consume a lot of gas and it is very comfortable to drive. The only part I would improve is the rear window. The visibility is not the greatest one but other than that it is a nice car I would recommend
2547,a year ago,4,Es super espaciosa y muy cómoda tanto de pasajero como piloto. Puedes llevar a toda la familia con comodidad y seguridad en todos tus viajes.
2548, a year ago,5,Sono stata passeggera in questa macchina e mi piace tanto.. la dimensione giusta .. ci sono molti comfort.. radio touch-screen .. per me 5 stelle
2549, a year ago,4,"This car was a dream! You sit high up and can easily see the streets. The car is big and sturdy, yet really practical. The downside was the mileage out of a tank. It was relatively expensive to drive long distances and not economical. Overall it makes a great family car though from what I’ve seen. "
2550, a year ago,4,I want one of these so bad. It is the perfect amount of room.             ............
2551, a year ago,4,I like this car. It’s really nice. We are keeping mine away from brad. Lol.

2560, a year ago,4,"Ok so this car is my baby and she is running very well but the few problems with the radio. This car is a 2014 Corolla I have tan seats which I don’t recommend for the messy type, that’s why I have seat covers. My biggest problem with this car is the stereo, it has a defect with all cars where the stereo touch screen doesn’t work. There is a bar at the bottom of the screen displaying different options and you can’t get any to work. This is my only complaint for this car bad to keep in mind when you are buying."
2561, a year ago,4,"I love my Camry! It has great gas mileage and lasts forever! I’ve driven it to Texas, Florida, and New York from Ohio in the 2 years I’ve had it and it’s holding up so well! I even bought it used with about 150,000 miles on it and my mechanic said that I have another 5+ years with it if I keep up on maintenance."
2562,a year ago,3,Mom had one and it was fine for what it was. Nothing special or memorable. A definite mom ride. Better than a minivan I guess
2563,a year ago,5,"My dad has had his Camry since 2007 and now it’s 2020. It’s been 13 years and it works perfectly fine! Now it has retired so we are gonna get rid of it, but Camry is an amazing car! I’ve seen the newest one and lemme tell you it’s got all the features you need!! Definitely recommend!!"
2564,a year ago,3,is a nice car..low maintenance and low budget services..is worth buying..fuel efficient..and atleast better than my previous car .. being in Toyota family has always been a great experience for me..there are huge discounts even on car servicing..
2565, a year ago,4,Not the best car in my opinion. Very cramped and small. Not to mention if something happens with the battery it’s over.
2566, a year ago,5,"I owned a 2016 Corolla and it was a great drive. Smooth, heating and cooling on point. Had to sell due to financial constraints 😞"
2567, a year ago,5,"My husband owns a Toyota Corolla, and I enjoy when I get to ride in or drive it myself. I prefer SUVs, but this is a car I don't mind driving. It's lower to the ground, but it's very spacious and easy to drive. He's also not had any major issues with it in the past few years, which is always a great sign!"
2568,a year ago,5,Great on gas! Low maintenance for repairs if you keep up with recommended Toyota repairs and service packages. I’d recommend for anyone looking for a very reliable car that is a little lower cost than a Honda!
2569, a year ago,5,"I always have been owned Toyota Camry due to durability, style and performance. Toyota is 100% the best car brand on market. I’m currently the owner of three 2 Camry’s (2005,2020) and a Tacoma (2020) ... there’s no doubt that I love it!"
2570, a year ago,5,This car is amazing. Very roomy and has three rows of seats. It is by far the best car that I have had and also takes the award for the best family car I have ever known. There's plenty of room for the whole family to sit and ride comfortably. It is also very quiet it is a hybrid. I would wholeheartedly recommend this car to anyone that need space.
2571, a year ago,5,Good little car. Well built. Great on gas. It’s a tank. It is my go to when all my other vehicles don’t want to run. I had to drive it all last winter because my Honda kept breaking down. I’d definitely recommend a Corolla.
2572,a year ago,5,"Absolutely 💯 love this car.. I dont know where to start!! To begin with, it looks awesome and has amazing interiors. Also it is spacious from inside and has great trunk space.. I love its rear mirror signaling which proves very helpful for changing lanes. Its AC and heater system is also quick compared to other cars. It can change temperature as needed very quickly. Great mileage and easy on maintenance. Many service centees across the country and good people for servicing and looking after your car. Loving the audio system and ease of controls on steering wheel. Overall great car and I love it 😀"

2580, a year ago,4,"Roomy, nice interior, I was merely a passenger.  Lots of leg room, and headroom.  Minimal interior but all the things you need.  I am not sure I am a super big fan of the hybrid--as it takes so many years to re-coop the investment...but it was a nice ride. "
2581, a year ago,5,"I love my car, it’s fancy enough to be anything I want it to be. I don’t believe there’s any cons but everyone have there own preferences when it comes to cars. My care is affordable and I would recommend."

2587, a year ago,5,Super spacious and able to hold a lot of stuff.  Was able to move a couch with relative easy.  Great gas mileage and smooth ride.  Like the model changes year by year.  Toyota seems to find a way to improve on an already great platform.  The resale value is always great too.
2588, a year ago,5,Love this make and model. Very low maintenance and part replacement or repair is not as expensive. I have a 2011 camry and have not had any major repairs since I bought it. Will recommend it to friends and family looking for affordable vehicles with low maintenance.
2589,a year ago,5,"The Toyota Rav4 is just an overall great car. The city mileage isnt great but it also takes 87 gas, so still affordable. The visor tends to stop staying up, and eventually the electrics for the windows start going."
2590, a year ago,5,These are very well made and drive smooth. I really like the new design of the car. It almost has a sports car vibe.
2591, a year ago,3,I mean for my first car its not that bad. It works great and obviously you can dress it up to make it fit your personality more. That is why I love this car. Also it is very affordable and low maintenance when you take good care of it!
2592, a year ago,5,"Great family car! We love to take this out of town, very roomy and can pack a lot of stuff in the back ! And it’s great because the backseats can be let down"

2594,a year ago,4,Surprisingly big space in the back! Very very quiet engine I mean I had to double check several times to see if it’s on! Lol 😂 Also very cheap to fill up your gas with this car!
2595,a year ago,3,Great car just not enough space. The trunk is pretty small as well. However amazing fuel efficiency and super cheap when filling up the gas tank!!! Major Plus!!! 😉
2596, a year ago,4,"Great gas mileage and impressive safety features.  Considering the price, I expected more features to be included like heated seats and a better dash and radio display.  Last forever!"
2597, a year ago,5,"If you've never driven a Toyota you're doing yourself a disservice. I have owned at least 4.. 84 Corolla, my 1st car given to me by my Mom. 2 Camry's & 2 Avalon's which I currently drive; 2019 Limited Edition Avalon. Her name is Avie Nightrider & She Is Bad llh. Legend has it (I know, I'm dramatic sometimes 🤭) that 10 men designed this car. I completely believe it bc 1. There is No Way 2 apply makeup in that car!!! The rearview mirror is awkward af smh like there's only a real mirror on the outside part?? Then the visor mirror doesn't have led lights, has those same 1984 dim-ish lights. Why, I just need 2 know WHY?? Aside from that she's perfect! 3 diff speed controls, very roomy, stereo system is outta this world & the gas mileage is great, I guess lol. I think it's a V6, not V8. I had automatic start factory installed bc I Always wanted that. I FINALLY got a brand new car that Im the only owner of THANK YOU GOD!!!"
2598, a year ago,4,"Overall a long lasting vehicle you can’t go wrong with buying. The dashboard is a little “jeep-like” for my taste. Big buttons, nothing fancy. Great choice for an adventurous couple or small family, as we like to kayak and ride bikes. This brand holds its value super well and will run 200k miles so that is why I purchased."
2599, a year ago,5,I love my Rav4! The standard safety features of Blind Spot Monitoring and back up camera are perfect! The seating is comfortable. One thing to fix - the overhead compartment that holds sunglasses rattles very loudly so I can't even put my glasses there. It's very inconvenient.
2600, a year ago,5,"Es la marca preferida de mi padre a la hora de cambiar su vehiculo!!! Es comoda, liviana y es un vehiculo con actitud."
2601, a year ago,5,"Excelente, me encanta mi carro!! Es super amplio, comodo y familiar.Toyota es una marca muy buena y bien valorada."
2602, a year ago,5,Great car. I bought it used and other than routine tires and oil change I’ve had no problems. I do wish the chairs were a bit better quality but it is not a luxury car.
2603, a year ago,5,"Service for maintenance, Great, Good prices and availablity for replace parts. Great millage per gallon. Do not have the knowledge to improve this product. "
2604, a year ago,5,"I loved this suv. This suv was roomy had a third row seat that was spacious and was easy to handle. The sequoia was built tough. I was hit four times in mine and it barely had a big  dint.  Gas mileage is good to me  and this is a dependable  reliable vehicle that will last to 200,000 miles and over I highly recommend this suv."
2605, a year ago,4,Its a good car and serves my purpose really well the ony bad thing is that i think it doesnt do gas really well
2606, a year ago,5,"Hands down the best car I’ve ever owned. I have a 2016 Limited, pearl white with black leather seats. It’s perfect for long road trips and beach day trips with the dogs. Has helped me move three times. Very spacious and have had zero issues with it. Love Toyota!"
2607, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota Corolla. I have a 2014 sport edition. I love how quick it is and how luxury it also feels. It may be 6 years old but it is a reliable vehicle and amazing on gas.
2608, a year ago,4,for a car built like a tank it sure is a smooth ride. Would buy or rent this car if I ever needed to haul a whole team of people. It does seem expensive though and to fill up the tank can go up to $70
2609, a year ago,5,"Quality, dependable vehicle that has minimal maintenance issues and is easy to maintain."
2610, a year ago,5,This van has lasted through harsh Chicago winters. It has also lasted over ten years. It is built to last. Great family car. Lots of room. The chairs are adjustable.
2611, a year ago,4,I really like this vehicle. First of all it looks great from the outside. The inside is just as impressive. Very nice and easily accessible dashboard. Lots of extras available. It is more on the expensive side but worth it. I would definitely recommend the 4 runner.

2643, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my 2016 RAV4 XLE! My husband and I bought it used with 19k miles on it last year. Prior to COVID I was commuting 80 miles round trip a day, so having a car that I love is crucial. It is comfortable, fun to drive, and has all of the bells and whistles that I need.

2644, a year ago,5,"I had a used 2004 corolla that I got in 2009. The car worked great the entire time I had it. It is still being used as a daily driver in my family at well over 200,000 miles.

2645, a year ago,4,"A lovely cheap car,really easy to run and doesn’t cost loads to run either, a really reliable car,I would recommend to a first time driver or someone who doesn’t want to pay loads to run a car"
2646, a year ago,5,I promised myself I'd never buy a van. I love the 3rd roll seating and the size of the trunk space. Great for my very active family!

2648, a year ago,5,"Love my Corolla. I travel for work, it gets AMAZING gas mileage and is easy to maintain!"
2649, a year ago,4,I love it. But I think the steering wheel too heavy for me. And also the car is in indonesia. I am not driving anymore.
2650, a year ago,5,"This is the best, longest running, most reliable vehicle I've ever owned. As long as you keep up with maintenance, these will ride until the wheels fall off, LITERALLY!! We have over 300,000 miles now and it's still running like a champ! Keeping my fingers crossed now, while knocking on wood!"
2651, a year ago,5,Roomy but could have HD a bit more room for the kids  we often rent a car so that we don’t have to put the km on ours for travel but I found this one just a bit lacking when it came to space  smooth ride great accessories 
2652, a year ago,5,"It is an incredible car, comfortable, spacious, ideal for a typical family, pros: it is economical in gasoline. Eat: it's not economical in terms of the car's value, it's very expensive, but you can plan to pay for it. I totally recommend it, the interior of the car is beautiful, the sound, the controls, everything."
2653, a year ago,4,Only ever a passenger in this car but I love it the seats have a heating option and it’s a great car to go on the road with I recommend it
2654, a year ago,5,"We have owned 2 highlanders in the past 10 years. Because we have found it a perfect fit for our family of 4. The kids have ample room plus if we want to take along any extra friends or family we can. We have a decent sized trunk that can fit baseball equipment including stroller, wagon and bags. If we put up the 3rd row there is less space. But we do love that we can take up to 8 people in this car. The 3rd row is quite small but it is good size for kids. We love the air conditioning because it reaches all the way to the back and there is plenty of cupholders for each person! 4 cupholders in drivers row, 2 cup holders in 2nd row, 4 cup holders in 3rd row! We also have good lights that can be controlled from the front of the car. It drives really well because it is based on the Camry engine I believe and so it doesn’t feel like a big suv at all. We love it!!"

2667, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Corolla is my savior! It is reliable, fuel efficient,   lasts forever! I could go on and on about this car! This a a vehicle you could get through your kids younger years safely and reliably,  and then give it to them for their first car with peace of mind. Toyota Corolla"

2675, a year ago,5,Nice car with plenty of room. Compact but not lacking in cabin space. Nice car for the price. Easy to drive
2676, a year ago,3,"I love my car, this is my first car ever, but I wish it was aesthetically cuter. There are some struggles with the structure of the car because I drive by myself so I wish that the speakers were louder, and that there was more space for people in my car, but it is very fast and good with gas. Make sure you’re buying from a reliable seller!￼"
2677, a year ago,4,"We have a 2003 model in 2020, so there are simply wear and tear problems with it at this point, but overall it is a sturdy machine! It is tall so for a short person, I rely on the side handles and front step to climb into the vehicle.I feel very safe in the vehicle because of it's size and the height.Sometimes the ride is bumpy, what can I say. Overall I am satisfied with this vehicle for my family needs."
2678, a year ago,5,"Muy contenta con este coche, es muy cómodo y rápido. No he encontrado ningún punto malo a este coche y lo recomiendo muchísimo."

2681, a year ago,5,"I own the 2020 Highlander Hybrid and absolutely love it! I needed an SUV that wasn't going to cost me hundreds in gas every month (or week!) Was safe, roomy enough for kids, car seats, and more, that had great amenities and safety ratings. The Highlander Hybrid checked all those boxes for me. Its beautiful, handles well, is quiet, safe, I am able to use my phone/app to lock the doors if I forgot, to track if I need an oil change, or air in the tires, it will let me know if I left window down and which one. It even has built in wifi so my kids can play on their tablets with ease when we go on long car rides.  I absolutely love this car!"
2682, a year ago,4,The reason I got the Prius was because I do long commutes. I have the Prius prime hybrid electric premium. I wish the Myers said she can go on electric are greater than what they are but I definitely save gas going back-and-forth to work or driving it around town daily. It’s a comfortable little car.￼￼
2683, a year ago,2,"I love Toyota, and my Sienna was best vehicle ever, but my Rav4 is tight quarters inside, and feel every crack in the road."
2684, a year ago,4,This was a good reliable car for me ex husband. He was even able to pass it on to a relative when he purchased his next Toyota.
2685, a year ago,4,I drive one of these for a few week as a rental car. I absolutely fell in love with it & would buy one if it was within my budget
2686,a year ago,4,Toyota is good brand i trust. Love the camry. Smooth ride. Drives nice. If i dont purchase aa dodge i would consider this car or something else by Toyota

2690, a year ago,5,"I had a chance to be a temporary driver of this car! It’s light to drive, easy to use. It’s really fast. It has cool design, but expensive for me. If I’d choose some new car I’ll prefer to buy this one, but it’s really pricey!"
2691, a year ago,5,Love this car. I’ve had it for almost 3 years and it has treated me well. Only problem I have is the screen turning off randomly when I first start the car but otherwise it’s been a good car
2692,a year ago,5,"This company always launches something new and exciting 
So in love with the car 
It was my friend's car I wish to buy it one day"
2693, a year ago,4,Love the vehicle. Great size for my children and myself. When the backseats are down there’s plenty of space. Which makes it a great car for going to IKea. The only thing is the steering wheel is very heavy
2694, a year ago,5,"Quite comfortable and spacious, it is an ideal vehicle for families. it is also economical, excellent for a long trip."
2695, a year ago,4,Great little car to get you from point A to point B. This particular car has great gas mileage and makes a great travel car. Depending on the package you receive with the car the price will very from affordable to not so much. I would recommend this car to anyone interested in Toyota cars.
2696, a year ago,5,Great hybrid car. I enjoyed using it as a loaner from dealership while work was being performed
2697, a year ago,5,I love my car. I have a 2007 Toyota Corolla. I bought her used and haven't had any problems out of her. She drives smooth and sounds great.
2698, a year ago,5,"We purchased our RAV4 Adventure last summer and absolutely love every feature! We opted for leather seats, as our fur babies shed so much. Makes it an easy clean up, also gas efficient. Highly recommend!"
2699, a year ago,5,I LOVE MY CAR! Drives amazing and so be had it for many years and many road trips! Still drives like new
2700, a year ago,3,It was ok. I felt a little closed in and the seats were not super comfortable. I would not purchase.
2701,a year ago,5,Absolutely love this vehicle my mom had one my dad has one my sister-in-law has one amazing vehicle
2702, a year ago,5,By what i seen it was an ok cat. But then again wouldn't know it wasnt my car. It was ok since i was the passanger.
2703, a year ago,5,I purchased my first car by myself at 21 and chose a Toyota Corolla. I absolutely loved that car and drove it until my husband totaled it (he was fine). It was very low maintenance and affordable. If I didn’t have smaller children in car seats I would purchase another one.
2704, a year ago,5,"I recently just purchased a 2017 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD. I absolutely love my car. I am short, so driving my old car (Honda Civic) was rough when seeing. I can see everything around me. I purchased my car for under $20,000. I highly recommend Toyota, especially RAV4's, to EVERYONE!"
2705, a year ago,5,I loved my little Bessie. She lasted 20 years. My grandparents bought her brand new and then I bought it from my grandma. She started having problems and the repairs were getting to be more than the value and the emotional connection. Soooo long story short lol I love them🥰
2706, a year ago,4,I like the Toyota Corolla. It is a great compact car. I think it’s great for a starter car. It is efficient and they look nice. Mine had excellent gas mileage. If you keep up maintenance it’ll last you forever. The only downside it the CD player broke but idk if they even come with CD players anymore.￼
2707, a year ago,4,I love my forerunner I just wish it had a little bit more legroom because my kids and I are all very tall people and sometimes you feel squished in the back I also wish it were better on gas mileage and that there were there was a hybrid version available
2708, a year ago,5,Great productvery Roomy style is amazing technology is amazing in the vehicle definitely one of my favorites
2709, a year ago,5,Kinda on the smalll side but Toyota is a great product and what they have to offere as far as quality and comfort is amazing
2710, a year ago,5,"I used to own a Camry and I loved it. We had it in our family for 19 years and it did us wonders. Not too much upkeep, not too hard to service or maintain. These cars last forever and they’re so safe"
2711, a year ago,5,This is the first car that I ever bought brand new. I had to pre-order it in 2008 because it was so new and they were still manufacturing them. I got great mpg and I was commuting over 100 miles a day!
2712,a year ago,5,"Este carro es una nave, es hermoso, es medianamente caro pero lo vale, es muy espacioso, tanto adelante como atrás, tiene una maleta grande."
2713,a year ago,5,This is the best car I’ve ever owned. I would totally recommend this brand to anyone. This is my dream car.
2714, a year ago,5,"Honestly I love Toyota. It was a little too light for me because I'm used to big cars but in overall was perfect! C'mon! Is Toyota, you know they are good."
2715,a year ago,5,I honestly love this car. My mom has it and I wish i could trade her. The best part is how all the windows can go down including the back windshield. I think they should find a different spot for the spare tire as someone like myself or my mom would have issues to get the spare tire off the bottom of the car.
2716, a year ago,5,"Loved this car. Ran it to 300,000 miles before it got totaled in an accident. I might still be driving it otherwise."
2717, a year ago,4,Rides well. Is reliable. I do bot own it but a friend does and I have driven with her and driven it myself.
2718, a year ago,5,"a pretty small car but it was a perfect first car! this car ran so smooth and honestly, my gas lasted me forever!"
2719, a year ago,5,Such a fun car! So sporty yet a gas saver- and obviously it looks super nice but runs smooth as well
2720, a year ago,5,"hugh quality car, amazing mileage and comes with so many great features such as car play!"
2721, a year ago,3,My mom had one so I never actually drove it but it lasted over 5 years so I'd say it's pretty reliable for a 4 door car 
2722, a year ago,5,I WANT A TOYOTA CAMRY SO BAD! It is definitely on my list as the next car that I would like to have. The newer models have everything I want in a car and more. I can’t wait until I am able to make a purchase!
2723,a year ago,4,These cars are cute  and nice almost like a little racing car so there not alot of room being they are only 2 doors i wouldnt recommend  if you have a big family
2724,a year ago,5,Ive never had a Camry  but i was always a fan of them o always thought they were a nice cute little car not to big and not to small of a car
2725, a year ago,5,One of the best cars I've ever owned. Maintenance is a breeze. Toyota reliability is second to none. Love my 'Yotas!
2726, a year ago,5,"I love the Prius! It is so quiet, both inside and out. The design is sleek and classic, and I love the eco-friendly functions/options. The Prius is also a great price for the lower environmental impact."
2727, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Prius runs smooth and gives me high mileage. It’s very spacious I have the hatchback model and it’s just the best. I did a road trip with my girlfriend and we fold down the seat and were able to lay In the back and took turns on naps it was very comfy.
2728, a year ago,5,"It is a very comfortable, spacious, large car, it is ideal for those who have family, and for those who want to do road trip, it is economical in terms of gasoline. Very nice car."
2729, a year ago,4,"If you are not worried about small spaces then the Prius is a great car! First of all, it has the greatest gas mileage. It saves a lot of gas through Eco mode as well. It has a very unique dashboard and its technology is very modern and easy to use. It also drives very smoothly!"
2730, a year ago,3,"My friend has a Toyota Corolla and for the most part they are nice vehicles. There are just two or three specifics that I do not lock. I have a child, so I have to have a big enough back seat for a car seat, and without having to move your front seat way up, forcing you to have no leg room, this car doesn't cut it. Also the seats are very uncomfortable and hurt my back after a short period of time of sitting down. I also do not like cloth seats or lighter colored seats because of stains and her car has both. other than those few things, it has an eco mode and gets great gas mileage, and drives smoothly."
2731, a year ago,5,"My boyfriend drives a Prius and at first I made fun of him heavy for it. However, I actually really like it! He’s gotten it to 47 miles per gallon on gas which is insane and it’s really a great car. The only down side is that you can’t add a tow hitch."
2732, a year ago,5,"The Camry is just such a standard vehicle that is reliable. Nothing flashy but it runs pretty great on fuel and holds its own on the highway nicely.  It's affordable and for the amount of time that the car is on the road, it's def worth every penny that they charge. "
2733, a year ago,5,I enjoy this car so much. It’s my favorite first car. Great with gas and definitely a car to depend on.
2734, a year ago,5,Love the off roading feel about it. Definitely one of my favorite cars to take out on a drive!
2735, a year ago,5,"Excelente producto, seguro, confiable, completo, con gran diseño y fiabilidad, rendimiento de un potente y económico motor"
2736,a year ago,4,"Siempre me ha gustado o la marca Toyota.
Y mi carrito es muy cuchi, compacto, comodo, lo amo.
Este carro lo recomiendo."
2737,a year ago,5,We love our 2018 Highlander it’s perfect fit for our family of 4 and we have plenty of room if friends or family want to ride with us. It has 3rd row seats and can fit up to 7-8 people but to be honest the 3rd row people need to be kids or really skinny small adults. The car has great air circulation there are vents all the way reaching the 3rd row because you can point the vents back there. Another good thing about this car is it has a smooth ride. The shocks are really well done... In comparison to our last car the Honda Pilot I would say this is smoother ride. It is smaller but really easy to drive. The sales person at Toyota told us it has the same engine as a Toyota Camry so it’s very easy to drive but strong. We love it and actually we loved it so much its actually our 2nd Highlander we’ve owned!
2738, a year ago,5,Long lasting family car. I do not think my dad will ever get rid of it. It’s always a pleasure to ride as a passenger
2739, a year ago,5,This is a great family car. They are also great for outdoor activities. It’s fits so much. And the gas mileage is great.
2740, a year ago,5,"Love my corolla, I’ve been part of the Toyota family since I started to drive. I love their cars they are so relatable. Before my corolla I drove a Camry that was in our family for 16 years. I highly recommend Toyota due to their great dependability."
2741, a year ago,3,Gas is expensive for this car. My mom had it for years and passed it on to my sister whom drives it back and forth. It has a huge tank and it takes a long time to fill up. Lots of space in the car though which is great
2742, a year ago,5,"The 2020 model is significantly better, with Apple car play and better screen. The car is extremely reliable and Toyota emphasizes safety in all their vehicles. Maintenance is cost effective as well, compared to other luxury brands."
2743, a year ago,5,Good first car lasted long and safe. Would recommend for a teenager. Small car. Fits a lot though.
2744, a year ago,5,I love this car so much! It’s a perfect size and I love spending barely anything in gas money. I definitely want a Prius for my next car as well.
2745, a year ago,5,Fuel saver that is roomy plus has the luxury of a top end vehicle. Having the All wheel drive is convenient living in the Midwest with the constant changing weather. Cargo area is spacious for the weekend of shopping.
2746,a year ago,5,It's a good car. I don't own a car but this is one of my uncle's car. We were going to a picnic during summer so we drove his car. The seats was comfy and nice.
2747, a year ago,5,"Good interior and exterior design. Nice cooling system, well equipped. Nice holding capacity, I love how they design the door. Speed is excellent, specially on highways I ready enjoy the ride. I also love how quiet the engine is, very good off road driving car. One of the best yt affordable here in the Philippines"
2748, a year ago,5,"Had as a rental car and loved it, just a bit more than I wanted to spend when buying a new car."
2749, a year ago,5,"Good care and reliable, would have nought one if I could not find a good deal on the 4Runner."
2750, a year ago,5,I got my first 4Runner in 2010 and it was brand new. Has always been a car I wanted after having had sports cars and a bad wreck. I gave it to my daughter in 2017 and bought another 4Runner because I love them so much! All three vehicles in our driveway are Toyota’s!
2751,a year ago,3,"Totally average car. Basic model. No upgrades. It was just a rented car for the week. Probably would’ve been better if they had a better package with it. But I’m talking I’m talking Basic to the max. Only had a.m. FM radio, manual everything, and the list goes on. Need I say more.￼"
2752, a year ago,5,"The best I really love it because is not so big but you have a good space there very easy to drive very secure, you don’t need to worried for anything if you are a mom you can’t go to all the places with this one"
2753, a year ago,5,"The best car, I love it it’s perfect if you live in the city, you don’t need to spend so much money for gas, has a good speed respond the dice is perfect and the model is amazing. I really recommended"
2754,a year ago,4,"Overall the toyota corolla is a decent vehicle to drive. It has great control, zero blindspots, allows the biggest and smallest of people to fit inside the vehicle cabin comfortably, had great ffg features for driving safety, and is in a good price range for  new driver. The only thing I am not a fan of is their break system -- could of been the one vehicle I drove but the breaks are very very tough and I'd rather have a sensitive break system."
2755, a year ago,4,It’s a good reliable car but doesn’t have enough room for me. I like to have storage
2756, a year ago,5,Has a very smooth chassis for an SUV. It rides more like a car plus I love all the extra room
2757, a year ago,5,I love my Camry. The seats are comfortable and it has all the amenities you could ever want. Except for an extra USB charger
2758, a year ago,5,"Great for everything! Going on trips, commute to work, hauling all kinds of things. I love the design and technology incorporated into this vehicle. It is very comfy to drive and ride in as a passenger. I love the amount of things you can store in it as well."
2759, a year ago,5,"Amazing vehicle! Long lasting, durable, lots of room.  Cons every light in the dash comes on pretty regularly. "
2760,a year ago,5,Love my Camry-  they are very dependable and last forever.  Pros- dependable. Cons- not very sporty and kind of boring
2761, a year ago,4,"My dad had an old highlander. It was huge. So spacious inside, and smooth to drive. The visibility was great!"
2762, a year ago,5,Loved the car: great balanc eof price and quality. Drives very smooth-you can't feel any discomfort when hitting bumps.
2763, a year ago,5,My mom used to drive a Toyota Sienna and she loved it. Very comfortable for road trips for our family of 5– plenty of space for everyone to spread out. We got rid of this car when the kids got older but it’s perfect if you have young kids!
2764, a year ago,4,Prius’s are great cars that don’t get enough credit! Mine is really comfortable and for a small car they are super spacious. The gas mileage is seriously amazing and they handle long trips really well. Unfortunately I blew the speakers but before I did that the sound system was awesome.
2765, a year ago,5,I love this car! It is really spacious and comfortable for long drives. The gas mileage is hard to beat and the sound system is awesome. Sometimes the electronic trunk feature won’t close properly which is annoying but I am probably just doing something wrong.
2766, a year ago,4,Runs well but the only bad thing is the touch screen that doesn’t work well but that’s a problem with most of Toyota’s cars
2767,a year ago,5,"Although I was in this kind of car when I took an Uber to an appointment, I was thoroughly impressed with this car. It's cool with the regular amenities, and I also think that it's quite affordable. So if you're looking to purchase a car, this may be an option you would want to consider."
2768, a year ago,4,"When I first test drove this car, it was very easy to drive. The steering wheel isn't too heavy nor too lightweighted with I really dislike. Breaks work very well. Sometimes the sensor when backing up doesn't go off until the car is right behind so I don't really trust the sensor. The monitor is where I am very upset at the car. It keeps asking me to update it every time I turn off the car. If I don't update it, it doesn't let me use the map. There are some blindspots but all cars have blindspots. If the monitor every gets fixed, I'd give it 5 stars."
2769, a year ago,5,I loved this car it’s so roomy and nice for a Smaller car. Super smooth drive no complains at all.
2770, a year ago,5,Adoro la mia Yaris. Ha quasi 20 anni e dovrò cambiarla ma mi dispiace molto. Che auto mi consigliate di acquistare? Una utilitaria non minicar. Aiutatemi grazieee
2771, a year ago,5,Safe car for my family and I. Never once had a problem with it in the last 2 years. I will definitely repurchase another toyota in the future.
2772,a year ago,4,We had a Toyota Camry as a rental car for a weekend trip. The car handled nicely and the extra features were lovely. The gas mileage was awesome for our weekend getaway. I would definitely consider purchasing a Camry in the future as it seems to be an affordable car. 
2773, a year ago,4,Well it was my first car and it was passed down to me from my cousin who used it for years and it was passed down to her from her mom. It’s a 2004 and gets pretty great gas mileage on it. I have problems every now and then but it’s gets me to where I need to go.
2774, a year ago,5,"I owned my Camry for about 2 years, I let it go because I was constantly driving from Texas to Florida so I put a lot of miles on it. I would def buy another one if the opportunity arises, such a comfortable car to drive."
2775, a year ago,5,"Although I would never personally buy one for myself, I love getting it as a rental when I go on road trips. This car is super reliable and durable. My mom had her for almost 15 years and it’s still in great condition."
2776, a year ago,5,"Best car I ever owned, reliable and great mileage. Let me safe in a wreck with an f150."
2777,a year ago,5,"I've had this car for 6 years now and I have problems with the radio, it turns off often when you change the station. It has like electrical problems, but other than that is a very efficient car"
2778, a year ago,5,"Love my RAV4. No major issues and bought brand new in 2016. Spacious, sleek and love the feel."
2779, a year ago,5,"It is perfect for an outing with the whole family. It's versatile, comfort, and style. Has Blu-ray entertainment center, all wheel drive, and dual moonroof."
2780, a year ago,4,"Great cars if they are all wheel drive. In snow, this car drifted and I hit a snow bank. Luckily everyone was safe in the car but I will never purchase a non- all wheel drive vehicle ever again."
2781, a year ago,5,"A very nice car, drives great, gas mileage isn't bad. Its definitely an affordable choice that is great for beginner drivers!"
2782, a year ago,4,"Toyota Camry is a nice vehicle.  Perfect for long road trips. Nice smooth ride that's super quiet on the highway. Plenty of legroom in both front and back.  Easy view dashboard. Peppy driving with lots of zoom zoom zoom.  Large trunk, plenty of groceries or luggage."
2783, a year ago,5,This Car was amazing! It was my two sisters and my first car and it was awesome. Nothing was too complicated so it was easy to understand.
2784, a year ago,4,I love the Prius hybrid. It’s very good on gas for a small car and its environmentally friendly.
2785, a year ago,4,The model is an older vehicle but has been reliable either way. It is very modern and sleek looking.
2786,a year ago,5,"It is a comfortable, spacious and economical car. gives a feeling of comfort and tranquility to travel. it is my favorite!!!"
2787, a year ago,5,Love this car. I can fit my 3 kids comfortably and then some. I wish the trunk was slightly bigger but it’s usable. The gas mileage is great for a bigger suv. It drives like a luxury car. Two thumbs up!
2788, a year ago,4,"I love my Rav4. She is a 2004, so she does not have an aux cord which is pretty annoying, but she holds up so well. I love the size and color and she has never failed me once. I want my next car to be a newer model, but other than that, I love this car. Would definitely recommend."
2789, a year ago,5,Anything toyota is sturdy and longlasting. It is obviously smaller than a camry but it does not feel suffocating at all even with multiple people in the car. It also is economical and doesnt use up a lot of gas.
2790, a year ago,5,Rav4 is a great SUV for going some place in style. It is very spacious and I also really like the height. Ive only been on the 2014 model but I can imagine how great the newer models are.
2791, a year ago,5,The camry is a very sleek looking car. It is very spacey inside and i like how there are many compartments to put things in/on. The only thing Im iffy about is that it's a bit low but thats how most sedans are anyway. I have the 2018 model and I love the features it comes with. Toyota never ceases to amaze me!
2792, a year ago,4,Great car! A little large for NY as it can be hard to find parking for but it was a safe and smooth drive. Also a four wheel drive which was great for the winters.
2793, a year ago,4,"Pretty good car. If you are looking for something more than sedan, go for it. Good for traveling, carrying big stuff. Fun filled car."
2794, a year ago,4,"I love this car..Good mileage, comfortable  and has luxury options. What else can we ask for? Thumbs up. "
2795,a year ago,5,"This is the perfect car to drive if you have kids. Its spacious. It seats 7 to 8 people. It's quite easy to maintain. It lasts years upon years, especially if you are good to it. It's affordable. It is just the right size. I lOVE my Highlander. My 1st choice car. Period. Plan to get another one in a year."
2796, a year ago,5,"good and reliable car, we got it because our daughter wanted car that have three rows of seats. After few options we decided to go with Toyota Sienna. We have it for 3 years and its still going strong "
2797, a year ago,5,"Even that I like big cars I like the Toyota Camry, it is comfortable and cute, the price is high if you get the newest Camry but this is a very good quality car and Toyota is a very good brand too if you like small cars you will like the Camry!!"
2798,a year ago,5,"Un auto muy elegante, cómodo y con mucho confort. Ideal para las familias ya que tiene mucho espacio pata todos, su maletero es espacioso y su motor inigualable. Son autos para tenerlos por muchos años ya que son de muy buena calidad. Sus defectos son mínimos "
2799, a year ago,5,It give good mileage.  Not a bad  ride.  I wish they would make it more comfortable.  They could make the interior more  comfortable.  Use  better leather.  It's affordable
2800, a year ago,5,Never had any major problems with it.  Love the car.  It doesn't cost much to travel.  Mileage is superb..  Make it more luxurious interior.  Very affordable
2801, a year ago,4,I love my car it fits a lot of stuff its very spacious. I can put my daughters bikes and wagons in the back. Its easy and affordable to maintain. And its just a great family vehicle.
2802, a year ago,5,Exceeded my expectations on the car. Wasn’t sure if the prize was too much but it completely compensated the gas expense. #lovethiscar #perfectsize #toyotaprius
2803, a year ago,2,"My best (and only) friend drives this car, and I have behind the wheel multiple times. (You know those nights haha). Car is good on gas and has a smooth ride. I feel confident pulling out onto the road bc it’s goes 0-60 relatively fast! It’s a nice sedan to drive rather than always taking my Jeep SUV."
2804, a year ago,5,"We have had a Highlander for about 3 years now. Runs great, very durable—even with two messy boys! I love that we can throw stuff in the back and wipe out any mess afterward. I would highly recommend a Highlander!"
2805, a year ago,3,Precio medio alto. Más serio. Mayor potencia. Colores básicos. Piezas más caras. Mayor tamaño. Mejor calidad y familiar. Es un vehículo versátil y básico para cualquier familia.
2806, a year ago,5,Prácticamente cómodo facil de manejas muy adaptable mi madre lo tiene y yo disfruto en el es muy chulo y buen coche
2807, a year ago,3,Not my favorite car but it’s very reliable and comfortable. I don’t like how big and large it is. The seats are very comfortable.
2808, a year ago,4,Not my favorite car but it’s very reliable and comfortable. I don’t like how big and large it is. The seats are very comfortable.
2809, a year ago,4,Not my favorite car but it’s very reliable and comfortable. I don’t like how big and large it is. The seats are very comfortable.
2810, a year ago,4,"I don't own any Toyota brand vehicles but my sister in law has a small truck and it's pretty decent. It runs very smooth, but it does waste too much gas."
2811, a year ago,4,This vehicle is very roomy and perfect for traveling or just using as a family car! It’s great!
2812, a year ago,5,"My first car was a ‘96 Corolla - when I bought it it was already 7 years old with like 175k miles on it.  That thing lasted me another 9 years and 150k miles, and had we continued to make repairs it probably could’ve lasted me even longer!"
2813, a year ago,5,"Bought my car at 0 miles and now im almost at 50 and i have yet to have any major issues with my car! I love it soooo much. The only problem i have is the lack of insulation, otger than that so reliable!Toyota Corolla Pacesetter Exhaust>headers/most Popular>headers"
2814, a year ago,3,I love the 4Runner! BUT this is definitely a guys suv and not a Family/Mom/Woman vehicle. For the price I would expect to get the whole safety package and this suv doesn’t even have blind spot monitoring! There are whole blind spots and there is no excuse for the lack of safety features. Also the rear door is manual. I know that this is because the door is too heavy but still there should be something. I’m too short to have to manually open and close it. I’d rather have auto open/close than a window.
2815, a year ago,2,The Highlander redesign is promising but the huge new screen is unusable when the sunroof cover is open. The is so much glare that it’s distracting.
2816, a year ago,5,Loved my Camry. I found it to be super reliable and a great car to drive. It was comfy and had enough leg room. The price was reasonable when I bought it.  It lasted a long time and didn’t have many issues. Great car.
2817, a year ago,3,"Pros: There is a ton of cargo spaceCons: Not great gas mileageThis is a pretty large vehicle, so it can be intimidating to drive"
2818, a year ago,5,"Súper bueno y económicos , no gasta casi gasolina. El mío me ha salido de maravillas"
2819, a year ago,5,"I’ve had this car for a little over 2 years. Haven’t had any problems with it other than things that I’ve caused. Great stereo system, back up camera comes in clutch, and great gas mileage. Its about $30 to full it up from empty."
2820, a year ago,5,"Good and reliable car, not the most sport looking car, but a car that you know will last a lot of years and rarely leave you by foot.
For an affordable and reliable car I would definitely recommend a Toyota."
2821, a year ago,5,"The time I was a passenger was pleasant, it is quiet and the seats are quite comfortable. Music plays pretty good and has good trunk space."
2822, a year ago,4,"Reliable, relatively comfortable. Large trunk good for little road trips. Good gas mileage."
2823, a year ago,3,Good sound system. More cargo space than I would’ve expected. I thought the seats were very hard and uncomfortable.
2824, a year ago,5,I would buy another Toyota in a minute￼! I have a 2013 Camry and it has never given me a days trouble. Ride smooth has enough features without being too fancy and looks good. The best thing about it is it is so good on gas!￼￼
2825, a year ago,5,"I love my corolla, is a great car, affordable and perfect for my small family.  Is big enough for us and I never was having a complain with car or the services provided by Toyota. I drive my Corolla daily to my work which is like 30 minutes."
2826, a year ago,5,"I had a 2006 Corolla for a little over 11 years. It's a solid car and a great choice for anyone looking for a basic car. It good good gas mileage and didn't need much maintenance. I'm not sure what the newest models are like, but there wasn't anything fancy on my 2006 version. It still worked great for my needs though."
2827, a year ago,5,"Very economical and has great features for the price. I don't drive it as often as my partner does, but love having something that is driver friendly, especially living in a big city."
2828, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love this car! I have a 2010 and if I could I would upgrade this to a 2020. The space, style and how safe it is are my favorite features. If you are looking for family car I would absolutely recommend this."
2829, a year ago,5,I’ve been owning this car for over 10 years and it’s still the best one I’ve ever owned. Great gas mileage and a very trusty car!
2830, a year ago,5,I have a 2019 corolla and it’s awesome. I love how it drives and saves so much gas. $25 dollars or less  I get a full tank for a week and a half. I’m constantly driving and it’s such a comfy fit
2831, a year ago,5,Reliable. Economically easy to maintain. Stylish look. Con... I would say that they are pretty basic even as you enter the top trims.
2832, a year ago,5,"Reliable and durable car. Worth the money. Good sale value. Not much to say, good cafe and seats  as very comfortable. Toyota Camry"
2833, a year ago,5,Toyota is my favourite brand for the car just because they are reliable and you will get good value. Very durable. Toyota RAV4
2834,a year ago,5,"Comfortable, one of the best Japanese car brands, saves gas, cruise control, seat warmer, heater, ac, sun roof, nice speakers, eco mode, adjustable seats, good space between seats and trunk"
2835, a year ago,5,I can’t give you a detailed review on this just because I don’t drive. But my parents do! They own this car and have been using this for almost a decade now and they haven’t had any major problems with it.
2836, a year ago,5,I have an 09 corolla and it’s the best car. I’m never getting other car than a Toyota. Very reliable vehicle
2837, a year ago,5,"Very, very reliable. It has 100,000 miles and nothing but tires and oil changes. Smooth riding, comfortable seats. I would not change anything!"
2838, a year ago,5,"Toyota es toyota! 😂🙌🏼 todo el que tiene o ha tenido uno sabe que los toyotas son los mejores carros la mejor marca mas duradera economicos y ufff estilos versatiles para todos los gustos , realmente amo los toyotas los corrollas, tundra, tacoma y la 4runner mis favoritos"
2839, a year ago,4,The interior is made out of very cheap material for a price that does not match. I wouldn’t buy another one in the future
2840,a year ago,5,"This is the very first car I've ever purchased and I'm super happy with it. No issues going on three years, good on has, and a nice system inside. Only wish I had a navigation in my little screen. Expensive for me but I barely put money down. Recomended"
2841, a year ago,4,"At first we were very disappointed to only be getting 20mpg,  nowhere near the that 40 mpg promised.  It took a good 5000 miles before mileage started improving. It's has several weird glitches with electronics and electrical things like refusing to unlock using the fob and Sirius randomly scanning stations every 3rd word of song. Of course couldn't replicate at dealership. Also it won't close the hatch with the fob awhile running"
2842, a year ago,5,"my 4 runner was my fav car ever, as soon as I'm im able I will get another , it is the perfect size for an SUV,  only car i want!"
2843, a year ago,5,No vamos a hacer un repaso por todos los premios que ha conseguido Toyota y que la acreditan como la marca de coche más fiable y más valiosa del mundo en distintos años y en diferentes eventos (de todos nos hemos hecho eco en los últimos años en el Espacio Toyota)
2844, a year ago,5,"Reliable as most Japanese cars are! My family owns a 2003 Toyota 4Runner that I put through a bunch of rough trials while growing up and learning to drive. It's built like a tank and makes you feel safe on the highway, though older models have gas mileage that leaves a lot to be desired. Ours is going strong at 130k miles with no major issues or hiccups."
2845, a year ago,3,"En général nous avons bien aimé notre RAV4 l’espace de chargement y est généreux et à une bonne hauteur. L’espace pour les passagers a l’arrière est très bonne. Toutefois nous avons été déçus des équipements offert dans le véhicule, pour les véhicules semblable beaucoup plus d’options étaient offertes. Toyota semble assit sur ses lauriers en profitant d’une bonne réputation de leurs véhicules ce qui est décevant. Gros point faible les freins (pour une conduite en ville) ils seront à changer presque à chaque années !! Les freins ne sont pas assez gros pour le véhicule et en plus le nouveau modèle (qui est plus gros et plus lourd) possède les mêmes freins !!"
2846, a year ago,4,I like it but it’s a hybrid and the battery needs to be replaced which is expensive...
2847, a year ago,5,Ho avuto una Toyota Corolla Verso. Molto spaziosa. Affidabile e silenziosa. Unica pecca i pezzi di ricambio costosi
2848, a year ago,5,"I have my Toyota Rav4 more than one year, and I am in love, it never gave me a problem.  great price for a great car! nice finishing and japonese quality"
2849, a year ago,4,"We have this care, I love this car..we feel safe and comfortable in side the car. In side arrangements is very good. Good millage."
2850, a year ago,5,It’s a nice car. If you get the sport it’s even nicer. Drives smooth. For a first car isn’t the best thing to do but if you can afford it then that’s a good positive.
2851, a year ago,5,"I love my 2016 Corolla! 
I purchased the sport model so I can use sport mode and the slightly improved suspension for driving up the mountains to visit my family. 
Great value, very comfortable, great gas mileage."
2852, a year ago,5,Great vehicles.  Totally reliable!! Couldn’t ask for a better vehicle! Completely happy with mine!
2853, a year ago,5,Love this car it’s super cute and roomy for your whole family to ride in on a trip! very
2854, a year ago,5,My sister has one and i love it! it’s super cute and so roomy and nice inside! Love it!
2855, a year ago,5,These cars are super cute and more like a family car for your whole family to fit in!

2857, a year ago,5,I love this car it’s super cute & my boyfriends stepmom has a black one! super cute!
2858, a year ago,5,My family owns a Toyota Rav4 2010 LTD color Silver that we bought 3 years ago. It's really elegant and comfortable. Great for my family of 5. Three car seats fits easily inside. Spacious with 2 extra seats on the back that you can fold or extend as needed. The motor is strong and gas saver. We never experienced any mechanical issues. If you need a strong SUV I recommend Toyota Rav4
2859, a year ago,2,"My uncle owns this car but im not a big fan of this. I always smell the gas in it.
#notabigfan#sorry"
2860, a year ago,2,"The driving experience with that car was so good, but I didn't liked the lack of space. I'm quite small so the size it's right to drive it, but not good if you want to drive with company. Also there's not too much space on the trunk, not even think about going on holidays with it."
2861,a year ago,5,"The Corolla is an overall great car. I have had no bad experiences with this car. I think that it is very affordable and very reliable. It rides very smooth and comfortable, yet it is quick enough satisfy most."
2862, a year ago,5,This car is amazing & that is the truth. It gets the best gas mileage out of any car I’ve seen. It was literally indestructible for me. I ran into so many things😂 and the car didn’t budge (honestly:).
2863, a year ago,3,It's a good car but it's a little too low and small. It drives really well but sometimes you can feel like you're literally sitting on the road. But a great car for college or high school student with room in the back too
2864, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my Prius. It has saved me a ton on gas and it doesn't feel like I'm driving a slow car. The pick up is great and has a power mode too. It's spacious enough, wish the leg room on the back seats was more to fit the car seat better but great cargo space."
2865, a year ago,5,"I am obsessed with the Toyota Camry! They get great gas mileage, they last so long and they are beautiful inside and out! The other really nice thing is that the value doesn’t decrease so that makes things easy when it’s time to trade or sell!! I would highly recommed them to just about anyone!"
2866, a year ago,5,This is a great car we have the plug-in and we get great gas mileage and it’s a great car for traveling
2867, a year ago,4,"It's not total luxury, but the last car I had was a Toyota Camry and it was typically very reliable, safe, and easy to fix. Overall I'd say toyotas are a great bet for anyone looking for an affordable and reliable car - they'll last a long time as long as they are well maintained!"
2868, a year ago,5,"Best minivan EVER! drives amazing, has so much room, and is perfect for my family! I never thought I would love a minivan, but this one is amazing! They are expensive but well worth the price! Get yourself one 😊"
2869,a year ago,5,My very first car.  Small for a first car easy to drive and park. Enough room but I don’t think for a growing family
2870,a year ago,5,Our first start up family car (SUV). Love it. Parking fine and spacious.        Only positive sayings for this car

2879, a year ago,5,Toyota’s are definitely the most fuel efficient cars and it’s cheap to fill them up. They last a long time if you take care of them like you should.
2880, a year ago,3,"It's considered to be the best quality-price car right now. However, I must confess that it isn't that great. I had a Hyundai from almost 20 years ago and it was as complete as this one. I expected way more from this Toyota, and even the seats from a year 2000 car are more comfortable!"
2881, a year ago,5,It’s a great car a lot of Uber and Lyft drivers use this car my grandparents also have this car.
2882,a year ago,3,My brother bought this model vehicle some years ago. It very spacious and luxurious.  The comfort it gives makes taking long drives bearable especially on bad roads.

Spacious enough! 
Horsepower (bhp)- 85 
Fuel type- Petrol"
2885, a year ago,5,"We LOVED our Toyota 4Runner, such a easy driving car with the coolest features. The drive is smooth and fits multiple people with room left. The car is expensive but if well taken care of, can really outlast other similar cars in its category."
2886, a year ago,5,"Toyota for life! This is my 3rd one. Dependable, nice looking and good gas. And I feel safe with my family."
2887, a year ago,5,I love my Prius! This is the second one I’ve owned and I love it just as much as my first. It drives well and has plenty of room to accommodate our family of 4. Plus- the gas mileage is amazing! Would definitely recommend.
2888, a year ago,5,"my old car was a toyota RAV4 and i loved that car so much. it was a 2003 and my sister has a RAV4 too but it is a 2012 which is obviously better than mine haha. overall, RAV4 is a really good car to get and drive to have for a while. #toyota"

2891,a year ago,5,"My 4 runner was by far my favorite automobile so far. Kinda like the best of both worlds. However if you have more than 2 kids it’s not really the best. I enjoyed mine for the beach, river and camping!"
2892,a year ago,5,"I had a Highlander SE, it was very roomy, I had the bucket seats in the middle and they actually move front to back to make extra room depending on sitting. However it just really wasn’t big enough for 4 teenagers. Drove smooth, gas mileage was amazing."
2893, a year ago,5,"My dad used to own a corolla and its the easiest car to learn to drive in. Also, I think its great for a starter car :)"
2894, a year ago,5,"I have always wanted a RAV4. Great quality, fuel efficient, good looking and more than anything very reliable."
2895, a year ago,4,My family loves the Toyota sequoia. It is a great travel vehicle for long road trips and can haul a trailer for whatever you need. even when I was in my offroading phase of life we put a small lift and some tires on it and it goes! with the locking differential in the back allowed us to learn in a safe environment. the only complaint is the back hatch. we have replaced the handle for it many times now which means the back window can't go down anymore.
2896, a year ago,5,"I have a 1997 Camery with 350,000 plus miles on it and it still runs hard! I am the third generation to own this car and each generation has loved it. it has great gas mileage, cold ac, and hot heat. I have no complaints about this car and will ride it till it can't go anymore."
2897, a year ago,5,"Proud owner of a Yaris Hybrid for the past 3 years and currently waiting for my new babe, Toyota Yaris Hybrid MY20 Premiere, to arrive (hopefully by the end of October).

2899, a year ago,5,I bought my Yaris from the Toyota garage as a birthday present to myself.. I have had it a couple of years now and everything is still in working order. It’s a fast little car that is serving me well.
2900, a year ago,5,"i like this car very much, but i drive this rarely. i prefer to go taxi. this car drives my husband he likes it very much and is satisfied."
2901, a year ago,1,"Hate this car bc it has no power. Whenever they give it to me at the car rental place, I cringe. I guess it’s good for the budget but don’t expect to go fast. This car is tiny and has barely any space and I’m 5 ft 2."
2902, a year ago,4,"Great ride for value. If you want a reliable car that doesn’t depreciate, this is your car. It’s a great value for the class of cars. It’s fairly efficient on gas too."
2903, a year ago,4,I owned this car in the 90’s and love the spaciousness of it. This car is killer on gas so it was $90 plus to fill up. I wouldn’t buy the car for the value as there are better ones on the market.
2904, a year ago,3,"I was not a huge fan of this SUV. I thought it was very difficult to drive, because I am small. I had a very hard time seeing over the wheel. The driving never felt smooth, it was always a bumpy ride passenger or driver."
2905,a year ago,5,"I love my Camry and all the technology that’s included. From my GPS, heated seats, SOS & cruise control."
2906, a year ago,5,My dad really like this car . Is a good price and comfortable and the trunk is a great size
2907, a year ago,5,I was a passenger in a sport Corolla. The details in the stitching throughout the car were amazing. The feel of sport and luxury at the same time. Highly considering this as my next car purchase!
2908, a year ago,5,"We have had our car for a long time and it works great we have never had any problems with it. Gas mileage is good, up keeping is affordable. The one thing is the brake pads seem to wear off pretty quickly. Over all a great car"
2909,a year ago,4,"Es un buen automóvil , es espacioso por dentro, es cómodo y fácil de manejar, en cuestión de dimensiones externas se considera grande"
2910, a year ago,5,"We have purchased 3 Prius cars and have loved all 3 of them. They are a joy to drive, and the added fuel benefits are the cherry on the top. We've had minimal repair issues, and probably will always own at least one."
2911, a year ago,5,A Toyota Camry is a great car!! They are comfortable and have a great mpg! I definitely recommend this car of you are looking for a reliable one. The price can be high but not awful! I would check this car out!!
2912,a year ago,4,Only ever drove my brothers one time. It’s got high mileage and still drives well for being an older vehicle. Toyota over all makes pretty solid vehicles and their cars can run forever
2913,a year ago,4,I have a 97’ Camry 280 thousand miles on it. Still running strong so definitely got my money worth. Bought it for 2000$ at 250thousand and it’s still doing it’s thing.
2914, a year ago,5,"Great comfort, Toyota really has perfected their Camry models. I wish they’d spent a little more time steering towards luxury rather than sporty looks but it does the job and does it well"
2915, a year ago,5,I really liked driving this car. Surprisingly the car was a lot bigger inside than it looked. It was very smooth and saved me tons on gas! The built-in bluetooth speaker system was amazing. Highly recommend renting one of these for your need toad trip!

2919, a year ago,5,"A reasonable price for an SUV, reliable and safe for a big and growing family. Runs on diesel or gas. Can be used as a 4x4"

2924, a year ago,5,I say this is the best car. Very spacious. 4 wheel drive. We got limited version of RAV4 grey color. Luv the shine on the car. Very much affordable. It has sky view too. Gives gud mileage. Gud for long drives. Inbuilt GPS.
2925, a year ago,5,"I loved my little Toyota Corolla period it was the first, new to me car, that I've ever had. It was a quick, zippy little thing that was super comfortable with a compact look. Extremely durable very reliable, and very safe. Unfortunately I no longer own this car because of a car accident that we had my 3-month-old son myself and my husband were all in this car when we were rear-ended by another vehicle and totaled my Toyota. Other than some back injuries we were all safe without serious setbacks. The other vehicle however, not in good shape. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a affordable safe reliable vehicle."
2926, a year ago,5,"I like the way the Toyota  Corolla  handled on the highway  ,it was smooth riding, gas efficient,  and comfortable."
2927, a year ago,5,Freaking love my car. I’ve owned a ‘98 and a ‘12 and they have been awesome. I will likely buy another Camry when I need a new car. Influenster makes you write a long review which is annoying
2928,a year ago,5,"I drive a 2010 Rav4, I have owned her for 10 years. Aside from basic maintenance, I have had to do very little work on this vehicle. I have driven all over the USA, in all terrain, and weather. The All-Wheel-Drive makes driving in the mountains and snow of Colorado a breeze; and in the heat of the desert the AC is quick to get to the temperature I desire. I am a long standing fan of Toyota, my first car was a 94 Camry that was passed down through 2 generations, and was retired with 400,000 miles. Over all I am beyond satisfied with the performance of my Rav4, and know that she (my rav4) will be there with me through hundreds of thousands of miles. A+ Toyota Camry"
2929, a year ago,3,I have been a passenger in a Camry but I have never drove one. My husband is a mechanic is says that Toyota engines are good and that the cars keep their value. I like the interior and it was very comfortable. The colors of the vehicles that i see on the road are nice.
2930, a year ago,5,My Dad owns a Rav4. So whenever I travel solo to visit my parents I just drive it. It’s a nice car.

2932, a year ago,2,it’s an okay kinda car. drives well and is pretty easy to maintain. great starter car at least but i would like something a little more luxurious
2933, a year ago,5,I love my Corolla! Gas mileage is amazing. Plenty of room for my big dog and my kiddo! We just hit a year in it and I don’t plan on getting a different car anytime soon. Highly recommend!
2934,a year ago,5,I love my toyota camry. Ot has never let me down in anyway. I also love that mine has a touch screen and it is even TRD.

2936, a year ago,5,I had a 2000 Corolla and it was so great. Super dependable. The only thing I didn’t like was that winter driving in Canada was tough.

2939, a year ago,5,My parents are on their second Highlander Hybrid. It drives and rides nicely. It’s out of my price range and a little large for my needs.
2940, a year ago,5,Owned two and loved both! My first car was a Corolla. Great value for your money. Nothing to improve. It’s a great car for!
2941, a year ago,4,"I love jeeps and this is as close to a jeep as my husband would purchase without all the mechanical issues jeeps are known for. With that said, I loved the height/clearance this vehicle has. Fun to drive. Lots of leg room. The trunk, for me, isn't ideal when grocery shopping as I shop and purchase enough to last two weeks. Although the trunk is deep, it is narrow."
2942, a year ago,5,Currently drive this car. Lots of fun to drive! Picks up speed quickly. Deep trunk space. Back seats fold forward for long objects placed in the trunk. My son is over 6 feet tall and sits comfortably in the front seat and back seat.
2943, a year ago,5,Sporty and fun to drive! I wouldn't recommend this car for people over 6 feet tall as the leg room wouldn't be adequate for them.
2944, a year ago,5,Very roomy. Love the captains chairs for the middle row seating.  Middle and rear seats fold flat or can be removed to haul large items in the trunk.
2945, a year ago,5,I love this car. It has plenty of room to be a small car. You can’t beat the gas mileage. Very affordable yet reliable vehicle. I would purchase again.

2949, a year ago,5,"Loved this car, my very first car in high school, drove it everywhere. I hit 300,000 miles. it was super reliable since I kept it on a strict maintenance schedule. Great on gas, used it to move into my college apartment and everything fit because its a hatchback, just dropped the second row and BAM space galore"
2950, a year ago,5,"perfect for college roadtrips. Nice compact crossover type, good on gas and looks so cute! i love the big trunk space and the second row has plenty of leg room. I like the console and it is easy to fit anything in without having the weight of a full SUV, or gasmileage!"
2951, a year ago,5,"love this car for family road trips, very smooth drive and nice and high off the ground. It is very light for being a mid size SUV, wish the trunk space was a little larger but it is easy to put the third row down and have extra space! love driving this car around"
2952, a year ago,5,"Its my first car and i love him... Tiene lo que necesito: A/C, Funciona a la perfección, su gasolina rinde muchísimo, estoy encantada con el ❤️ Sus asientos son cómodos! Recomiendo este size de autos para las personas primerizas como yo a manejar! Te hace la vida mucho más fácil❤️"
2953, a year ago,5,"I loved my 2003 Camry. It was a very long lasting car - making it up to 300,000 miles! I would definitely recommend this car if your looking for something dependable."
2954, a year ago,5,"This is a pretty decent car.  It drives great, and feels great to drive!  The seats are comfortable, so going for long rides isn’t a problem, for the driver or the passengers.  It is also roomy, so it allows for plenty of leg room and what not.
The cons, in my opinion, are they don’t come with stock rims instead they come with hubcaps that are known for them falling off and/or breaking which causes the look of the car to be less attractive.  Another con would have to be the stock CD player the car comes with, it doesn’t even have an AUX input which I prefer to have so I can hook my phone up to it or whatever."
2955, a year ago,5,I had a Celica for 11  years that I used and abused. It continued to serve me well up until it just could not keep going anymore. It was a really great car. And it looked nice too. I definitely want to get a Toyota again.￼
2956, a year ago,3,It’s very roomy and like having a bigger vehicle so lots of room but don’t like that I use so much gas it would be nice if it could be more gas efficient they are worth the price and I recommend Toyota to anyone
2957,a year ago,4,Love my Rav. I leased a 2019. It’s great. Only wish it was a tad better on gas. Trunk space is great. Lots of features and options. Very affordable. Will definitely buy another Rav.
2958,a year ago,5,I absolutely love my 2012 Toyota Highlander! The second row can be transformed from a bench seat into two individual captain chairs. It’s a great vehicle to travel in for vacations!

2962,a year ago,5,My current Rav4 is my second one I have owned. I feel like this car is super reliable and goes for miles and miles. I have found they also hold their value very well.

2969, a year ago,3,Older model with some issues but keeps on going! I hopefully will be able to upgrade to a newer model in the near future.
2970, a year ago,5,"This is a very roomy and comfortable set of wheels! The backseat has lots of leg space. The bucket seats are very comfy. It’s a smooth ride also. A brand new highlander can be costly, but if you’re shopping for a SUV consider this one. It’s worth it!"

3010, a year ago,5,These are good cars. They last and run way longer than other cars in their group. They’re Easy on gas.  They look good. I think it would be a great first car or work car. They are a bit more expensive but they hold their resell value.
3011, a year ago,5,Super comoda y ahorrativa en gas. Tiene un tamaño familiar en donde cada pasajero ira comodo y con libre espacio. Su diseño esta de 10
3012, a year ago,5,Super hermoso y ahorrativo en gas. Por su tamaño compacto se hace facil estacionarse el cualquier lugar sin tener que poner mucho trabajo
3013, a year ago,4,I used to own an SR5. It was sporty and cute. My parents have owned two regular Corollas. They are good dependable cars if a bit boring. The current models seem very nicely styled. I recommend a test drive to see if it is for you.
3014, a year ago,5,This is a good reliable car with great mileage. The older Camrys just keep running. We have one from 2000 that is still going strong. I don’t know if the more recent models are as durable.
3015, a year ago,4,Owned for a few years; seemed to be in the shop for repairs more often than not. C- at best.
3016, a year ago,4,These are built to last. I’ve gone through many cars and many many problems. My corolla has had very few issues and the problems that I have come across have been very simple to fix. My husband has been able to fix most things himself
3017, a year ago,4,My mom owned one and ran it fir over ten years until the body fell apart.  But the heart (engine) still wanted to go.  Our neighbor was so impressed she purchased a matrix when she needed a new car a few years after mom.

3021, a year ago,5,"I drove this car for over a year and was always completely comfortable in it. This is a reliable and safe car, and although it doesn’t have a ton of bells or whistles, it drives well and keeps up very well."
3022, a year ago,5,"This is a car I got secondhand from my dad. It’s been serving our family well for over ten years. Very reliable and a safe option that held up great through three different teen drivers and tons of road trips. I’m not much of a car person, but this has always been steady and gotten me where I’ve needed to go."
3023, a year ago,4,I liked it . Not my taste but I’ve only been in one like maybe 4 times in my lifetime
3024, a year ago,5,"I love the Camry so much I still have the 1st Camry I owned (2001 del) and a 2015 xse one. These are so reliable, the trunk space is huge . The interior is beautiful. I love it."
3025, a year ago,4,The 1st car I ever owned was a Toyota Corolla and I was in love with it. I had a love and hate relationship with its size though once I had started a family.
3026, a year ago,4,I loved it for when I needed to travel with a lot of things in the trunk. The only con was that I found it a bit small for my taste.
3027, a year ago,4,"Good car, very few issues with it. I find it comfortable to drive and would definitely buy another Toyota in the future"
3028,a year ago,5,"Seriously you can't go wrong with a Toyota, I've had my camry for 13 years and it's still running strong. I've never had any issues. I love how reliable my car is, if it were to ever need a new part it wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. Service is also super affordable. My next vehicle will most likely be another Toyota."
3029, a year ago,5,"This car is within a reasonable budget, it has 2 things that caught my attention about it, 1 proximity sensor and the other sensors for when you get off the road.  in my particular I am a driving apprentice and it has facilitated my day to day."
3030,a year ago,5,My husbands car drives amazing. It looks small from the outside but has a lot of space in the inside. No problems with it. He’s currently customizing it. Drives great but downfall you can feel the speed bumps on the road. Other than that very comfortable.
3031,a year ago,5,"It’s a very reliable car. Never had major problems with it just the basics, oil change, etc. It was an 2007 but was drivable up until 2020 it was still good condition and still running just needed an upgrade."
3032, a year ago,5,This is a good company of vehicles. They last a long time. The also don’t decrease in value. Our little truck is a 2006 and still runs great. I would highly recommend this vehicle company to anyone!

3035,a year ago,3,"Car is too low to the ground, suitable for a young person, not a family car, space is extremely tight and barely any trunk space"
3036, a year ago,5,"We have a Toyota Camry.  Originally it was my personal vehicle.  I drove it for years and really loved it.  I now have a Rav4.  Toyota will always be my favorite make of vehicles.  My husband drives the Camry now which is way over 200k miles. He uses it as a work vehicle and it gets great gas milage, just like the day we bought it."
3037, a year ago,5,"I love my Rav4 and the only vehicle I would trade it in for is a newer Rav4. It is so roomy.  I can haul almost anything, and I have even hauled furniture in it. The comfort for the driver and passengers is great.  The drive is smooth and even though its a suv/crv type vehicle, I can turn on a dime.  The mirrors give me enough vision and I don't seem to have a blind spot when changing lanes.  I enjoy driving it."
3038,a year ago,5,"Belle voiture, facile à conduire, confortable, tien bien la route, place ok, coffre ok. Je recommande Toyota @"
3039, a year ago,4,"As a young adult, my first car I purchased was the Toyota Corolla SR5. It was sleek, had a hatchback, with tinted windows. I had to learn how to drive a stick shift in order to buy it!  This was the car that looked like a sporty station wagon, but had 4 doors along with the hatchback. It was great for long drives and comfy enough to sleep in the back, after putting back seats down.  Toyota Corolla 

I drove that car until it couldn't go any further, ended up being an electrical issue - traded it for the pickup truck, Both great vehicles"
3040, a year ago,4,Toyota makes a great vehicle! I've owned both a Toyota Corolla SR5 and had purchased a brand new pickup back in the 90's. The motors are strong and are very durable. I think all Toyota's get great gas mileage as well! I'll probably check out the Tacoma or the 4Runner. As long as it had a sun roof! Toyota Motor Company Toyota Corolla
3041, a year ago,5,"I have the 2020 toyota corolla hybrid super economical in gasoline.  comfortable, spacious, perfect for my use."
3042, a year ago,5,"I have a 2017 limited awd. I’m in love with my car. Perfect mom car. The third row is okay but more for younger children, adults have a hard time back there because the seat is smaller and there is less leg room. I usually have the third seat folded because I need the trunk space. With it up there’s hardly any trunk space at all. I guess I would change that feature but in all reality it does what I need it to. It had been very reliable as I’ve driven it half way across the US and back. It’s been in all weather and does well. I would recommend this to any family. The all day weather liners are a must have, don’t leave the dealer without them!"
3043, a year ago,5,My parents own this car and they love it. So do I. But I am a Honda lover. It’s so good on gas surprisingly.
3044, a year ago,5,My toyota is probably the best car i have ever had!!! My whole family has had a toyota at one point they last forever! They usually don’t have too many problems and they will treat you well if you keep them up to date! I would highly recommend getting this car!

3048, a year ago,4,This is the car I learned to drive in. My stepdad had a white 4Runner and taught me to drive in it. I also took my driving test in it. It will always hold a special place in my heart. The 4Runner was great
3049,a year ago,5,"Love it! Great gas mileage, like amazing mileage. Takes only $15 bucks to fill mine! Very smooth drive, great even if you have kids. Seats come down for extra room overall a great little car!"
3050, a year ago,2,"My husband drives a Corolla. It gets great gas mileage and is reliable, but it is so uncomfortable to drive and to ride in. My husband is always complaining of back pain after driving for an hour. Since we got the car new for free from his great aunt, we can’t complain and will drive it until it dies, but it is so unattractive. Will not get another Toyota"
3051, a year ago,2,"My father in-law drives a Prius and he has loaned it to me many times. I really don’t like this car. I don’t care for the way it looks, it has no ability to get up to speed, and it is a bit confusing how to control fuel vs battery. I would never get one of these"

3056, a year ago,5,"I love my car , it’s big and has so much room for traveling , road trips and passengers. Has Bluetooth , touchscreen and also room in the trunk for luggage’s etc"
3057, a year ago,5,"When my parents said they bought a 4Runner, I was confused because we are Ford loyalists. I really can’t deny though that this car is so bad ass. It’s a smooth ride, great on gas, and super spacious. I can’t wait to get one of my own!"
3058, a year ago,3,These are very nice. They look small from the outside. Once you get inside it’s shocking how roomy it is. Gas mileage is amazing! I would never own one only because I would get multiple speeding tickets. It would be like a mini race car for me.
3059, a year ago,3,"Nice smaller SUV. For something that doesn’t have third row seating there’s a nice sized area for storage in the back. I think they make third row ones, but at the time I only seen two rows. Easy to maneuver. Smooth ride. Comfy seating."
3060, a year ago,5,When I very first started driving I bought a used car. Once I was working and doing well financially I looked at MANY Camry’s! It’s by far one of my favorite sedans! They’re pricey but they hold their value and that’s good.

3064, a year ago,5,LOVE my 4Runner! Toyota’s as very reliable cars and practically never have issues and when they do they don’t end up costing you much for a fix. I bought mine since I have 3 kids and it’s amazing. Three car seats in the back fit perfectly. Kids have a lot of leg room. I love that I can see clearly 360 out of my windows when I am turning or just observing what’s around me. The trunk is huge so it’s perfect for packing a lot of things to go places. I have the trd off road version because we love to go off roading in the mountains or fun beach drives. The car drives super smoothly and quietly. Everything about it is just perfect. This was my dream car and definitely super happy to have it.
3065, a year ago,5,Honestly the mileage alone makes this car the best I have ever had. It’s never given me any problems. Has enough storage space in the trunk and is ample for 5 people. Would definitely recommend.

3071, a year ago,5,This is a very nice the they run forever as long as you maintain the vehicle they  are comfortable and very smooth riding Toyota Camry
3072, a year ago,3,"It is very expensive but it costs little it has an electric motor so it is ecological and therefore does not harm the environment, it is also innovative and that compensates for how expensive it is"
3073, a year ago,3,This car is great on gas I can at least say that. And another plus is that it is push to start. However you will feel very cramped while driving this car and it takes a while to get to speed which didn’t make me feel safe. Wouldn’t recommend
3074, a year ago,5,"Reliable, amazing on gas, very comfortable to ride in and there is so much storage space in the trunk. I do wish it was push to start though and had the nearby car lights warning."
3075, a year ago,5,This vehicle is the best I could ever drive I fell in love with his life is very good in all aspects saves gasoline and it is wonderful to drive these Toyota cars in the future I am planning to buy a toyota prius v Toyota Prius

3077, a year ago,5,I have a 2008 model and I love it. Not a fan of the newer models but my 2008 model is amazing. Very spacious and room for 5 people. It has decent gas mileage but again is an older car so would definitely recommend the brand.
3078, a year ago,5,Very nice car. Its small but great in speed. It is perfect with small parking space! The trunk needs to have more space though
3079, a year ago,4,Great car very impressive on the new model. So many upgrades and lots of leg room . Runs really great it has lots of new upgrades . Toyota Camry is a good it’s at a good price range depending on  what style you want. Yes I recommend the Toyota Camry

3082, a year ago,5,Love this vehicle. My only complaint is that it’s top heavy and rides a little less smooth that some vehicles. But still one of my favorites.
3083, a year ago,5,Love my truck! Never drove a Toyota until this year #2020 and it’s prob one of the better brands of vehicles I drove!  Very comfy and smooth ride! ￼
3084, a year ago,5,"I love this car. I have a 1998 Camry and I love how safe and secure I feel while driving it. It’s a full-sized sedan, so even when I have passengers it doesn’t feel too cramped. The trunk is spacious.  As long as you keep up with the maintenance, this car will last you a very, very long time."

3090, a year ago,5,This was a great car the interior is amazingly I love the sound of the speakers and how close me and it feels great car .￼￼
3091, a year ago,5,"Love everything about this vehicle, definitely one of the best purchase made I love the heated seats and my sunroof I would love for it to be more roomy, it’s on the expensive side but definitely worth the price"
3092, a year ago,5,I just bought a 2020 model and I LOVE IT.  It’s very specious. Off the ground. The speakers could be better but i didn’t want to dish out the extra $1500 for the jlb speakers. It could be quieter BUT I know it’s not a high end car. I’m happy with my purchase and will keep it around for 8ish years.
3093, a year ago,4,I got it as a mom car when my husband and I started talking about having kids. I got into a wreck at 16 weeks pregnant and if I didn’t have this car I would have been dead. I highly recommend it for first time moms and even just married couples! It will be my daughters first car too!
3094, a year ago,5,"My Camry is roomy, has good gas mileage and is a nice looking car. I like the Toyota brand . I have had no issues and the only expense is routine maintenance such as oil changes, brake pads, wheel alignments and tires."
3095, a year ago,5,I drove a Toyota Prius for about 4 years and it is an amazing vehicle. The drive is very quiet and smooth and the gas mileage can’t be beat.
3096, a year ago,5,"We bought our Sequoia last year and love it. It is a Platinum edition so we have a DVD player for the littles, which is no e for when we take trips. It is great when taking turns and a smooth ride. We took it to Toyota a couple of months ago for general service and the manager said he never sees them come in for maintenance."
3097, a year ago,5,I love my Sequoia! Nothing beats a Toyota SUV. They last forever. The Sequoia is so roomy and comfortable. I can take a family vacation with it or put the seats down and haul larger items in it. Its so versatile. Amazing sound system as well. True luxury!!
3098, a year ago,2,I did not like this car it seems to be a gas hog and the breaks seemed to be robbing on something or maybe it was just because her car is old

3129, a year ago,5,I have lived this vehicle. It’s much more luxe than the Honda I test drove. Much less road noise and seats are more comfortable. Parking and going over bumps has been an adjustment because my previous car was an SUV that was much higher off the ground. This car lets us haul a surprising amount of stuff. Highly recommend.

3139, a year ago,5,My inlaws own two prius cars. I get the appeal. You dont actually need the key to start it as long as its on you. Very economical and good on gas. Especially helping when living in the bay area where gas prices are always through the roof. I would definitely buy this car
3140, a year ago,5,I owned a camry and I absolutely loved it.  Was great on gas not very high maintenance and fit all 3 of my kids carseats in it
3141, a year ago,5,"I own a 2017 corolla  best purchase I've ever made great on gas super stylish,  spacious, and lovd the color of mine its super unique."
3142,a year ago,4,Love this little car. So reliable. Sporty. Fuel efficient. Cost efficient. It’s more of a plain car.
3143, a year ago,5,"Good car, especially for commuting. I get good gas milage and the tank doesn’t got a lot to fill. I haven’t had my issues with my car and I thankful for that. Definitely an affordable care for a college student."
3144, a year ago,5,"My mom had one of these and when she decided to get a new car we sold it to my aunt and it still rides perfectly. It was a 2010 and there hasn't been a single issues with it through either owner. If you have kids I would highly suggest this minivan because it never felt like a ""mom-car"" and was a very smooth, quiet ride. "
3145, a year ago,3,I personally do not like driving and/or riding in these cars. They are very noisy and very rough on the road. I think a lot of people like them for the hype they get but you can get better styles of cars that have a smoother ride and still have the off-roading ability. 
3146, a year ago,3,I always thought these cars rode very rough and not quiet at all. My friend's mom had one and she bought it because she wanted something more expensive and she hated it so much. Because it is a Toyota it probably doesn't have any issues. Mostly personal preferences. 
3147, a year ago,3,Si me gusta el diseño pero de adentro no mucho se me hace que le faltan muchas cosas y esta muy sencillo me gusta mucho la marca toyota pero este carro no es mi favorito aunque es un carro muy económico
3148, a year ago,3,Great reliable car. Gets good mileage. Can opt for a more sporty look. Toyota maintenance isn’t too expensive either.
3149,a year ago,5,"I loved my Toyota Camry. It was comfortable and rode well. It was fully loaded and had leather seats, xm radio, climate control, and a moon roof. It fit lots of people comfortably, and had room for a large amount of stuff.  And it got great gas mileage too!"
3150, a year ago,5,Very reliable car had one for 3 years and was total last year. Drove to Florida several times from Alabama and the gas mileage is very good 👍. Not one problem with that car.
3151, a year ago,4,Toyotas are known to be pretty durable and long-lasting so my family always enjoy driving Toyotas. We also prefer SUVs as they allow the driver a higher perspective of the road. They're also great for transporting larger items when needed instead of being limited by the trunk. 
3152,a year ago,5,I drive so much and I’ll his is by far my favorite car I have ever owned ! 40 mpg and the perfect size ! I got a great deal and  worth every penny ! I love my car so much !
3153, a year ago,5,"I really liked my Camary, it got really good gas mileage. It's a great for commuting back and forth to work daily. There isnt anything I would improve on. It wasn't too expensive for the most part and for a 4 cylinder it was fast. I would reccomend this car even though it is a foreign branf."
3154,a year ago,5,"I recommend this type of car because it is very economical in terms of gasoline, as well as being of very good quality"
3155, a year ago,5,"One of my favorites cars. It sits high, isn’t bulky. I like the visibility in the vehicle. I really miss this car. It’s a great vehicle."
3156, a year ago,5,Great car. Toyota is always super reliable and runs for decades. Can’t go wrong with any of their cars in my opinion!
3157, a year ago,5,Great car. Toyota is always super reliable and runs for decades. Can’t go wrong with any of their cars in my opinion!
3158, a year ago,5,Great family car. Toyota is always super reliable and runs for decades. Can’t go wrong with any of their cars in my opinion!
3159, a year ago,4,Such a great car! I’ve had it for four years. There’s seriously been zero issues with this car. I even drove across country and it was so easy to fill up gas and had no issues. There’s a reason why Toyotas are slightly more expensive.￼
3160, a year ago,5,"Love this car. There are sensors that tell you if you start drifting over the lines on the road. This has saved my butt a couple of times while trying to help my cousin learn to drive!! Safety features 10/10 and I love being up so high when I’m in the car. The moon roof costs extra but is totally worth it!
Great for road tripping, if you need to evacuate the fires with all your pets, or going to the drive ins!"
3161, a year ago,5,"I have a prius plug in and I have to tell you, this car is amazing. I can get to work and back by only using the charge mode. It so much more affordable than buying gas. I haven’t had to put gas in the car since LAST YEAR and I drive every day. Look for local spots that have plug in spots!"
3162, a year ago,5,"Great car. Very dependable, great mileage, very safe. I have had mine since I got my license and I haven’t had any issues with it so far. Monthly payments are affordable and I would recommend it to a friend!"
3163, a year ago,5,Gets you from point A to point B. Can take a good beating and will keep going. Reliable and won’t let you own. Not the most high performing or sexiest car but worth the money. Toyota all the way for a gas powered car
3164, a year ago,5,We have a 1995 4Runner and we love it. I’ve had it for 15 years and it’s one of the best rigs other than my 2011 Toyota Tundra.
3165, a year ago,5,"It is an excellent car, it does not use gasoline, it is very comfortable I love  Toyota RAV4 It is super comfortable I recommend it 100%"
3166, a year ago,5,"This was my car all through high school. It was super safe, reliable and lasted me 10 years! It was also super affordable. The technology didn’t match with other brands, but it was doable!"
3167,a year ago,5,"Owned this car for 10 years, it was amazing, perfect size for a small family,hatchback was great, cheap on gas, very sad they stopped making them"
3168, a year ago,5,Love a Toyota. Great family cars. Highly recommend. I always feel safe. Inexpensive services too.
3169, a year ago,4,"Love my car so much. It does have a very small back seat. I would probably not recommend as a family car, but it is definitely a fun car. It drives like a tank. I always feel safe."
3170, a year ago,4,"I like the camry, but not as much as my prius. I can fit a lot more in my hatchback prius than a camry. To me a camry is a prius without the good gas mileage."
3171, a year ago,5,"I have owned a couple priuses and they are my favorite car. From the great gas mileage, to the hatchback for storage, etc. and the smooth driving. I can’t imagine owning anything else!"
3172, a year ago,5,"I love my highlander! It rides smooth and it’s fully loaded! From San Diego, CA to Las Vegas, I did not have to pump, my car was full tank and that’s what’s great about it."
3173,a year ago,5,I love this car!! It’s so fun and cute. My friend has this car. And she seams to love it. I don’t think she has ever have problems. I love driving in her car. I would recommend this car.
3174, a year ago,5,"I drive a 2018 RAV4. I’ve used it to move twice now and it holds so much with the seats folded down! I drive 30 miles to work each day and I get about 28-30 MPG highway. I wish it had Apple Car Play but other than that, it’s a great car!"
3175, a year ago,5,This is a good reliable cost-effective vehicle. It requires low maintenance. Very doable and has great gas mileage. This is a great car for a new driver.￼
3176, a year ago,5,I definitely might but in the 5 years or so but I want a hybrid because gas is always been a killer for me
3177, a year ago,4,"I have a 2018 RAV4 and have loved it since the first day. I knew I wanted a small SUV for work and travel, and felt that this was built with more care and quality than competitors. I have the XLE, so the alloy wheels were awesome, with a few other special touches.

This is my second car ever. My first was a base-model Nissan that didn’t have a back up camera, motion sensors, or anything like that. I drove that care forever, but was grateful to get into something safer. I like the model I have, although I have toyed the idea of switching to a newer version."
3178, a year ago,5,"Purchased the 2013 Toyota Scion for my daughter. My husband likes the Toyota brand and felt comfortable putting her in this car. When we had a mechanic look it over after purchasing since we bought it used for a first time driver, the mechanic said it was mechanically sound and would last her a long time. Great vehicle for a first car."
3179, a year ago,4,"Love this car for our little family. It's got great compartment sizes for passengers and the trunk can fill what we need to camp! As our family grows out of a sedan, however, we'll need to look for a bigger model."
3180, a year ago,5,My sister has the corolla I drive it sometimes it’s a nice car. Love that it has a back up camera
3181, a year ago,5,Love this car so much I have an Scion FR-S 2016 and I really love it. People say it goes with me cuz I’m small..not that much space but I really enjoy it for myself
3182, a year ago,5,"Fuel efficient, cozy, and definitely a money saver. Just about the first of its kind in modern fuel efficiency."
3183, a year ago,4,"The only reason why it’s 4 stars is because it’s pricy lol but I guess it’s worth it, it’s gorgeous and spacious very smooth on the road I love it ! And it’s Toyota so you know it’s made to last"
3184,a year ago,5,"Es asombroso en tegnologia y lujoso, es demasiado cómodo para viajes largos y en familia o con muchas personas"
3185, a year ago,5,This car 8s very comfortable and plenty of room in the front and back. One of my favorites. And the features this car comes with is a bug upgrade
3186, a year ago,5,"Super gas mileage, well manufactured with many different options available.  Very popular"
3187, a year ago,5,There so nice smooth ride and don’t spend so much money on gas. Great audio and ac is really good.

3189, a year ago,5,I am in love with this truck is my sisters truck we went to Vegas in this truck it’s really good
3190,a year ago,5,This is best car I’ve owned! I like that you can turn on and off eco mode. It’s small but not not too small!
3191, a year ago,4,Love this car drives smoothly i usually get anxiety when I’m not the one driving but with this car I felt safe
3192, a year ago,4,This is a great car for first time drivers. It is compact but spacious for the driver and passenger. I wish the back seats had more space but the overall design of the Corolla has improved within the last few years.
3193, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Sienna is a reliable family car, perfect for long drives. It can hold up to 8 people which is perfect when going out with family and friends. The seating is spacious and the trunk space is convenient for moving or big items like furniture. I recommend this car for families!"
3194, a year ago,5,"I think the Camry is a reliable car. It is compact but roomy enough, appropriate for someone living in LA. I love the Hybrid Camry I have because I save so much on gas and can go further per tank. I recommend this car!"
3195,a year ago,5,I just got my Yaris last year it is a 2019 and I absolutely love it it’s very fuel efficient and I absolutely recommend it!
3196, a year ago,5,I love any Toyota vehicle.. I drove this for just a few minutes as I am looking for a new vehicle to purchase soon.. I would like a car or truck with a fair amount of room inside and also one that has a good tow package with it so we can pull our camper plus have the room inside.
3197, a year ago,5,My Toyota is amazing.  It takes a licking and keeps on going.  it's a tough car!  A con would be that it lasts forever.  
3198, a year ago,5,"I had a Camry many Yeats ago.. It was a stick shift which is what I wanted.. It was a great vehicle I never had any problems with it, it was comfortable and I loved this car.. I would not hesitate to buy another one."
3199, a year ago,5,"LOVE. I’ve had my 2019 Toyota 4Runner TRD Off Road for a little over a year and it’s the best vehicle over ever had. Beautiful, safe, and will always hold it value."
3200, a year ago,5,It has been years since I’ve been in a Toyota Corolla. My best friend had one while we were in high school
3201, a year ago,5,"This is a model Which I would love to have, 
I like its sporty maneuverable system. 
I like the salon. This is very cool car 🙏🏻♥️ Toyota Motor Company"
3202,a year ago,5,These cars are wonderful my mom has had one for about four years now and one of the best cars. Gas is really cheap and can drive it forever.
3203, a year ago,3,"It is nice that they let you believe it is an eco car. However, when you check its emissions they are just the same as a normal car. Very disappointing."
3204, a year ago,5,A super car. I am delighted with my cart. Toyota is a brand that does not disappoint especially if we give proper maintenance to cars.
3205, a year ago,4,Economical vehicle. Great life span. Amazing features for the price. Perfect car for students and those on a budget.
3206, a year ago,5,My Toyota is a older model but I love my car and I trust it very much if you take care of your cat it will last for a very long time especially a toyota
3207, a year ago,4,"It’s a reliable car, it has quite a bit of room and has great gas mileage. It is my back up car if my daily breaks down."

3209, a year ago,5,My new favorite car! I go everywhere in it and I love it!! So comfortable to drive and gas efficiency! I love that the whole car ride is so smooth and so relaxing. Great for a small family car or not. The price is pretty good!
3210, a year ago,5,We have just purchased so it works well. Let’s see and wait for the future experience.
3211, a year ago,5,"I like the Camry I had two a 2011 and a 2014, but I rather drive a vehicle that is higher up from the ground. I especially loved my Tundra."
3212, a year ago,5,I love my RAV4. I've been a Toyota owner for over 20 years and I would never drive any other vehicle. Toyota for life.
3213, a year ago,5,I liked the Toyota Sienna a lot but my kids grow and I changed recently to highlander which I love but when we travel I miss the sienna where I could pack a lot.
3214, a year ago,4,I love my car looks great and very comfortable to drive I was driving Siena before so I miss the extra space the highlander has 8 seats but very crowded
3215, a year ago,5,"Probably one of the best cars out there. Dependable, great gas mileage and affordable. Plus it has the bells and whistles that most people need without being super expensive"
3216,a year ago,5,My husband and I have owned many Toyota. We've had more RAV4s than any other model. We love that they are just as suited to take us on a camping trip as they are for the weekly commute. It fits our family of 3 and has plenty of room and cargo space. We would definitely consider getting another RAV4 in the future.
3217, a year ago,5,Honestly my dream car. Lots of room & great gas mileage! It drives really smooth and fits my family perfectly.
3218, a year ago,5,"I normally drive Nissans, but having my Toyota has been a good experience. I haven't driven her on a long road trip yet but as far as city mileage, it does well. For my budget it was affordable."
3219, a year ago,5,I have old a Toyota forerunner and I must say it is by far one of the best SUVs I’ve ever had I like the fact that it gets decent gas mileage for being a four-wheel-drive and you can take it from city to the hills extremely easy nice room for five maybe six if your small decent amount of cargo room and nice clearance over all the best vehicle I’ve ever owned
3220, a year ago,3,Love this car nice reliable dependable great first car for a teenager ample room in the backseat and drives really fast
3221, a year ago,2,Love the vehicle again the only reason I wouldn’t purchase for my family is I have a large family and therefore I couldn’t fit anyone in it but great gas mileage I like the style of the body and it looks real sporty
3222, a year ago,5,Very cute economy car and it's perfect for somebody who doesn't have a big family and doesn't need a lot of room in their vehicle it's just perfect for a single person
3223, a year ago,5,"My car was 17 years old when I sold it ran like a top. They will last forever if you take good care of them.
I've had it I had a Toyota echo and I love that one and now I have a Toyota CHR"
3224, a year ago,5,Is a very good car because is very comfortable and sure and is stable whit the long time for that I really like
3225, a year ago,5,Toyota is a trusted brand. My Toyota was a smooth running engine. It was comfortable to drive. My Toyota got really good gas mileage.
3226, a year ago,1,"I really really really REALLY wish there was a way to give zero stars... or not even a review at all.... but for the sake of these reviews... please don't buy this car. it's worth NOTHING once you drive out the lot and nobody, I mean nobody will accept as a trade-in. "
3227, a year ago,5,This is the most reliable car EVER. The Corolla that we’ve had since my childhood is still running without problems.
3228, a year ago,5,Best vehicle I have ever owned just not big enough  for all the grandkids to pile in. Had off road package and absolu had a blast
3229, a year ago,4,It’s been a great vehicle that has lots of interior space. Perfect for loading up the dogs. Gas mileage could stand to be a bit better however and the cabin air filter is a little difficult to change out for a new one when it’s time. I haven’t had to repair anything in 4 years!
3230, a year ago,4,I bought my first Toyota Corolla a year after I graduated college. This was my first adult purchase and I was so grateful to have a new car after driving an unreliable junker all through college. The car is one of the most affordable cars of the Toyota brand so my car payments fit in my meager budget. The car was very well made so I didn’t need to ever take it to a mechanic other than for oil changes and tire rotations. Great car for anyone on a budget!
3231,a year ago,4,"My Toyota Camry was a great car. It had plenty of leg room, and ran well. Toyota has a problem with the rear lights, though. I've noticed that hasn't been fixed, because even new Toyota sedans have taillights that go out randomly."
3232,a year ago,3,The RAV 4 was disappointing. It seems Toyota forgot the awesome leg room they used to have. Lots of corners to hit your knees on trying to get in and out. I ended up buying a Hyundai instead.
3233, a year ago,5,The Toyota corolla 2011 in white it’s good and the air omg it’s like Alaska but it’s too small for my likes.
3234, a year ago,5,I have a Toyota RAV4 2004 and is the best option in the world I want the new Rav4 because is the top.
3235, a year ago,5,Increible para una familia o una sola persona. Muy buena en la ciudad y buena en zonas rurales
3236, a year ago,5,Igual que el toyota corolla pero mas grande y avanzado. Este sin duda ha sido uno de los mejores modelos
3237, a year ago,5,Pequeño rapido y comodo son las tres palabras que describen a este carro. Lo tuve 1 año y fue lo mejor
3238, a year ago,5,Grande y muy cómoda. Perfecta para una gran familia o para un viaje largo y con muchas personas
3239, a year ago,5,Perfecto para las personas que le gusten carros rusticos. A pesar de ser este tipo de carro son muy buenos para la ciudad
3240, a year ago,5,Muy buen carro. Comodo y manejable. Se ajusta a cualquier persona. No muy fan del modelo
3241, a year ago,5,El mejor carro de todos. Super versatil y ligero. Rapido y comoda. Este carro es de verdad mi favorito
3242, a year ago,5,Love this car! Super easy to drive and feels super safe! The technology in the car is easy to use and set up and is very good at accelerating. The safety features are a must as well!! So fun to drive and super safe!
3243, a year ago,5,We used one of the newer Camry's recently as a rental car from our insurance after an accident. Surprisingly the Camry was fun to drive and felt very sporty. I would definitely put it on the short list if and when we consider buying a new car in the future. 
3244, a year ago,1,Toyota motor company is terrible. They lied to me on several occasions. They told me they were going to help me and then when they called me back they offered no help. They are all liars . 
3245, a year ago,5,I love these cars!!! This is truly my dream car and hopefully one day I’ll have it. My have a few friends that drive one. They last a very long time and most have all of your car needs included. Cheap on gas and last for years with very few issues depending on how you care for them.
3246, a year ago,5,Good car and runs great! Is very easy to work on and runs for a long time without many issues as far as things breaking down.
3247, a year ago,5,Safe and dependable like all Toyota vehicles and SUV’s.  Perfect for a small family or teen.
3248, a year ago,5,Great vehicle for a small family or teenager driver.  Safe and dependable as all Toyota’s are.
3249, a year ago,5,Perfect car for small family or teenager.  Compact but safe and highly dependable.  The best
3250, a year ago,5,I will never own anything besides a Toyota!  This is the third 4Runner our family has purchased. Love them!
3251,a year ago,5,My baby is a 2001 with over 100k miles on it and he still looks brand new and runs strong! When it comes time to replace my car (in the far far future) I definitely plan to stay in the Toyota family simply based on how well this car has held up.
3252,a year ago,5,"I LOVE THE HIGHLANDER!! Its better than the mom van and more affordable than a huge SUV.  The size just right for up to seven people with two in the the second row and  three in the third row seats. Although the leg room is a little lacking in the way back, it still works if needed. The second and third row seats fold down for hauling larger items. Its great on gas and has a sleek classy look."
3253, a year ago,5,Very good car!! Will last forever!! Very good mileage I love it such a great car I think everyone should invest in one!
3254, a year ago,5,I've had my 2008 Camry for over 10 years and I love it!! Never had a problem besides the regular wear and tear. 
3255, a year ago,4,"My husband owns a 2017 Hybrid Rav 4 and absolutely loves it. It gives us great mileage on gas, approx 32-36mpg. We love the sunroof, as well as some of the upgraded features such as the blind spot monitor, rear and front sensors, Lane departure, and auto slowing down while cruising. I gave it 4 stars because the gas tank is small, so my husband has to fill it up quite often, especially because he drives an hour to and from work, and it does not come with heated seats. But overall, a great vehicle for us, has plenty of space and is a comfortable ride."
3256, a year ago,3,"Once we had this 80's Celica. It was about 1996, I was about 19. I had to push that thing in heels almost every morning while my then boyfriend (now ex husband), popped the clutch. Finally him and his brother in law tried to fix the carburetor and completely messed it up. Somehow they found some guy that actually bought it for like $200."
3257, a year ago,3,"I've only driven the Prius at work. I hated it,  I never knew when the car was on. I've heard they can have a lot of maintenance issues with the batteries"
3258, a year ago,5,The Camry is a good dependable car. They retain resale value well because of it and have less maintenance issues as they age
3259, a year ago,5,My car is very good. It's mileage is brilliant. And after buying it we didn't need to get it serviced to this day. We are using this car since 2015.
3260, a year ago,5,"500 miles per tank of gas, great cargo space and an easy ride. Basically all I could ask for to get me from Point A to Point B! Highly recommended for folks who commute- it doesn’t just save you gas money, it’s smaller size makes it a snap to maneuver in tight spaces!"
3261, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Toyota RAV4. I haven’t had any problems with it so far and I love the look and feel of driving it! It is very affordable and great quality.
3262, a year ago,5,"This is the best car ever made. I love this car. Sporty, roomy, it has everything. Totally"
3263,a year ago,5,Love this car it is the best car I have ever had. It gets great gas mileage. It has been reliable to me so far and it is affordable.
3264,a year ago,3,This cars are common on my country. So my friends have one at my place work. They said it is economic.
3265, a year ago,5,"It’s nice to look at and comfortable to ride on.  Although, I think if you have a big family, it’s not the wisest vehicle to purchase because it feels cramped on the inside. Overall, I like riding this if I’m going somewhere fancy."
3266,a year ago,4,This was my first car! It is reliable and great on gas. I didn’t love the service at my local dealership ( really long lines and waits for repairs).
3267, a year ago,5,"love my toyota corolla! very reliable, good gas mileage, and hardly ever an issue with it"
3268, a year ago,5,"I LOVE 4RUNNERS!! Maybe because I grew up in a 4Runner, but its a hecking good car nonetheless!!  They're really reliable, more so if you take care of it right!"
3269, a year ago,4,"It is a reliable car that offers what yiu need and not more or less. It has a good price, decent space and drives decent too."
3270, a year ago,5,This suv is very sporty looking. This is a great family vehicle. It also drives smooth. It is fuel efficient. Cons are that its body very boxy.
3271, a year ago,5,Has 3rd row seating so plenty of space for people but also spacious enough no one is cramped. Drives great as well and perfect for any type of weather
3272, a year ago,4,A great car for the city. When I was searching to purchase my own I was between a Yaris and my Hyundai i10. Hyundai finally won the “battle” but Yaris is a lovely car too. I totally recommend it.
3273, a year ago,5,Corollas are amazing cars that with their proper service last for many many years. My Dad had two and served him well for decades. Highly recommended 👌💯
3274, a year ago,5,"I had the chance to drive this type vehicle while my daily runner was in the shop. I don't mind this vehicle but it is something different for me of course being that I don't drive it everyday. The exterior of the one I had, black. Interior was grey like color, It was newer. 2015 model. I liked the stereo system, speakers gas mileage wasn't horrible, but of course I don't have a far drive to and from anywhere. I live close to where I need to go. It drove smooth, well kept up maintenance wise. My overall impression is that the Rav4 is very nice. I could see myself owning one possibly later on down the road."
3275, a year ago,4,"I do enjoy it. However I was disappointed to discover that my console does not come with gps navigation neither could I figure out how to to upgrade the software to do so. Heated seats would have been nice for the price. I do feel like Toyota is a good brand whose cars last a long time when taken care of. But I know there are competing cars on the market cheaper with a few more bells and whistles. I got the car for it's long lasting reputation and great service when car needs maintenance, so I was willing to go with out the bells and whistles but a girl like to feel fancy on the drive also, and likes to know she's getting her dollars worth in every detail."

3288, a year ago,4,"I love this car! It’s reliable and I have had only normal problems that arise from driving every day such as needing new tires and brakes. No other internal issues. The only thing I wish this car had that I have had in previous cars is heated seats or power seating. But aside from that, it’s perfect and exactly what I need."
3289, a year ago,3,"I have the 09. Basically it’s a civic that wants to be an SUV. It takes forever to get the air back to my son. Tons of recalls, but it gets decent gas mileage lol. I love Toyota but not this one in particular"
3290, a year ago,3,"It’s okay, not my favorite, a little to small for my liking but it is very fuel efficient and cheap to run"

3292, a year ago,4,Nice car with nice visibility. Has a family feel to it. Makes me feel safe in the car when someone is driving it. Helps get through MN summers and winters.
3293, a year ago,5,"I have a 2009 Corolla with 165,000 miles on it. I brought it to the dealer for a recall fix with 145,000 miles on it and they said my car was “barely broken in”. I expect to get well into the 200,000 miles on this car and would 100% buy a Toyota again."

3303, a year ago,5,"I love my Camry. Seriously the BEST car by far that I've ever owned. In the 5 or so years I've had it, I've barely had to take it to the garage, like, at all. It's got a ton of miles on it, almost 200k, and she still runs like a beast. My future car will most likely be another Camry or just in the Toyota family."
3304,a year ago,5,"Fantastic car, never let me down. Great value. I save a lot of money because it makes 17 km with 1 litre. I like to use it In town but it is good also for the long distances"
3305, a year ago,3,"I always thought Toyota Corollas were good vehicles, but my mom has had nothing but problems since her purchase a couple years ago. While it is the perfect size for a senior, she constantly fights for the key to release. The interior is comfortable with nice em memories, but the vehicle never feels safe because her brakes like to skip and grind. The vehicle is in the shop constantly but the problems never cease. I find it unfortunate that my moms last car is nothing but trouble. Toyota Corolla"

3316, a year ago,3,"My mom worked for Toyota for many years & prior to that she worked for many other car companies, my dad also worked & still works in the car business, Toyota would give my mom different cars to drive every few months & this was one of them. comfortable seating, smooth ride, roomy"

This says a lot since we tried so many different cars from Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Bmw, etc"
3322, a year ago,4,Before we got rear ended I had a corolla for about five years. It was a great quality car that never needed any parts but for regular maintenance and upkeep. The only downfall to the Corolla was how absolutely slow the engine was. In order to speed up enough to pass someone I would have to wait for a downward slope in the road and gear down. It was horribly slow but trustworthy and reliable.
3323, a year ago,4,I have a 2010 Prius used it for a good 8 years until I purchased a truck. The Prius was a great saver for gas and the environment. Easy to maintain. I am passing the car off the my oldest daughter. I would recommend for others.
3324, a year ago,4,I like this car a lot!! Myself and my husband almost got this car but I did not like that the interior is so outdated. I feel like if it did not look like the early 2000’s inside the car I would have gotten this car. ￼
3325, a year ago,5,My Toyota Corolla saved my life! We were unfortunately  in a head on  accident and my corolla did exactly what it was supposed to do. I was able to walk out of the car with some bruising and a couple scrapes. I truly credit this car and it’s safety features for saving me that night.
3326, a year ago,5,"I love Toyota products, they have always been reliable for me. My Corolla was a great car, it was very easy on gas, and when I traded it in I got a decent price"
3327, a year ago,5,este es el que me quiero comprar en 5 años mas jajaja me gutas mucho el color 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
3328, a year ago,5,I never drove. My husbamd drives it and he loves it while I love and enjoy the ride. It is comfortable and good
3329,a year ago,2,Had bought a tacoma brand new and had nothing but issues with it. The only reason I bought a tacoma was due to reputation of Toyota. 2 engines later plus valve jobs etc. No thanks. Prior to this I had crappy older used cars that were not near the headache. Since I have sold the tacoma at a huge loss and bought Ford f150. Had this truck so far 13 years minimal issues. Great vehicle. Love my Ford.
3330, a year ago,5,"Been going strong for 160000km and all I had to do was change the breaks, oil, and tires. Never had any mechanical issues"
3331, a year ago,5,It rides much like a car just a little higher and more storage. It's easy to park in a parking lot. It's pros are that it is a reliable car and the coins are that it is a bit pricey for what you get it should I say don't get. Any upgrades don't come with the car you have to pay extra for them. All in all good safe family vehicle.
3332,a year ago,5,This is a super reliable SUV. It has third row seating that lays completely flat when you need the extra room. The middle row also lays flat. You can fit 8 people in this vehicle and still have room. One of the best purchasing decisions I made vehicle wise.
3333, a year ago,3,My partner drives a 2014 Camry and it’s a generally nice vehicle. My biggest concern is that the cabin is relatively loud.
3334, a year ago,5,"I love 4Runner. Definitely the best car I’ve ever driven. So smooth, good on gas if you think how big it is. And it’s big! I’m tall, so I prefer big cars and this one isn’t as big as trucks, just a perfect car as for me"
3335, a year ago,5,"A Corolla was the car I bought when I decided to have another child. My Corolla was nice, dependable and fit my family and all my daily to dos. The car has more room than it seems like it does. It gets up and goes as well. Don’t let the size fool you, they are great, low and inexpensive maintenance vehicles. They’re great for family cars or for starter cars."
3336, a year ago,3,They are a low and cheap maintenance vehicle. It’s a good family size car. The only reason I give it such a low rating is because my mother in law had one that she took great care of. When she was driving on the highway her engine caught fire.
3337, a year ago,5,"Very good for woman or men, really good with gas, diferent colors and options.yiu have everything if you are first owner or travel and need rent a car, is really all you need."
3338, a year ago,5,I’ve driven my parents Prius. It’s a great gas saver. My only complaints are that the gas pedal is sooo sensitive. It’s. A little hard to see out the back windows in the hatchback models.
3339, a year ago,5,I love my little corolla. With yearly maintenance it will last ages. Mine is model year 2011 and still going strong. I will drive this car into the ground. I got a great deal on my car and recommend for anyone who needs a car that will last and get them from point a to point b.
3340, a year ago,5,Toyota is probably the best and most affordable car brand you will find out there. Japanese cars are always up to everybody’s expectations. Because they don’t break down on you and they rarely have any problems.
3341, a year ago,5,I think a Toyota Corolla is a reliable vehicle. It is good with gas and affordable to fix. This car will last you a long time if taken care of.

3343, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Celicas are great and Toyota makes fantastic vehicles such as this celiac which will run forever if you take care of it, these cars by far are one of the few that can be driven over two hundred fifty thousand miles and keep on ticking not to forget the maintenance is easy and inexpensive."
3344, a year ago,5,"The Toyota ScionFRS is a great car comes with paddle shifters so you can switch between the two depending on your mood, there are many modifications available to add on to this vehicle to give it your own style!"
3345, a year ago,5,"I had a Toyota Prius C 2014, and it was such a reliable car. My dad bought it for me to drive to high school and swim practice on the other side of town. Gas mileage was amazing, and I saved so much money compared to the other cars we had. I loved seeing how high I could get the mpg on every trip. It was the perfect car for me during that time in my life. I definitely recommend checking it out to see if it would be a good fit for you. (Not really a family car because of the size)"
3346, a year ago,5,I have an older Toyota Sienna but I love my van! I would buy a new one in a heart beat. But I’m also a BIG TOYOTA LOVER! So I would buy any of there cars!! Toyota is very affordable and will last you a life time!

3352, a year ago,5,Mi #toyotaRav4 es el mejor vehículo que he tenido en mi vida. No gasta nada de gasolina y tiene el cuidado que te da una SUV de la mejor calidad. Vivo enamorada de mi camioneta.
3353, a year ago,4,Great for families on the go. Had a 2004 would suggest something newer as door sticks a lot.

3359, a year ago,5,"Luv my carolla, very fuel efficient. Just the right size for me. Great features like back up camera, Bluetooth capability and safety enhancements. Very low maintenance. Great price for a reliable car."
3360, a year ago,4,Easy to source parts. I don't particularly care for the design of the exterior but it's on the lower end of the lineup
3361, a year ago,4,Easy to source parts and mechanics generally knowledgeable outside of the dealership. High on the list of cars targeted for theft. Generally affordable.
3362, a year ago,4,Pretty dependable vehicle. The cabin could be a bit bigger. Parts generally easy to source. Common vehicle. A more spacious cabin would definitely help. Relatively affordable vehicle. 
3363, a year ago,5,"I loved this car! The ride was so smooth, it had Bluetooth connections, backup camera, everything!!! I definitely recommend this car for an everyday car to work and back. I want one again! I can’t wait to buy one with time of course but definitely want this one again."
3364,a year ago,4,It's safe and stable. Sensitive brakes. But it's very gas consuming. So be prepared to spend a lot more money on gas
3365, a year ago,5,Lots of space. Good for a family. Comfortable! Love the body style and features! Toyota’s are built well so they last long time
3366,a year ago,5,"I really enjoy the mid-range size of this car. It has a good amount of power, drives really nice, and is a comfortable larger car to handle."
3367,a year ago,5,"I love my little Corolla! Technically I have a Toyota Corolla Hatchback - it’s zippy and feels sporty, but the interior is spacious for its size. It’s my favorite car I’ve had."
3368,a year ago,4,"I enjoy how this car drives - it’s a smooth ride and the roomy interior is amazing. However, the blind spots feel a bit large for a car, so I knocked a point for that."
3369, a year ago,5,"My mom has a 2018 version and I love driving around town in it. It's such a smooth and comfortable ride. Each side can control their air temperature, there's air vents in the back, and heated seats. There is plenty or room for all and the gas mileage isn't bad either."
3370, a year ago,4,"The new 4Runner is amazing. Looks wise they’ve nailed it, and power wise it’s the only SUV that compares to the sports cars I’m used to driving. Perfect for getting away and camping, hauling the dogs to and from the dog park. First non GM car I’ve really loved."
3371, a year ago,5,Love this car! Such a smooth ride! A/C is perfect. So is the heat. And it’s a very comfortable ride.
3372, a year ago,5,I had my scion for 10 years it helped me drive to and from so many states. The only part I didn’t like was the handle for the trunk it was just to easily broken
3373, a year ago,3,My boyfriend owns this car and it’s very nice but my only quarrel is it’s kinda fragile. Random things break or become worn and it’s not even that old.
3374, a year ago,5,"The best car I’ve ever owned. It is so reliable! Rides nice and smooth and feels luxurious on the inside. Leather seats that heat or cool, moon roof, heated wipers, etc. There’s so many neat safety / tech features! I will forever be a Toyota customer."

3377, a year ago,4,I’ve only driven my friends car and yes it does good on gas. But the visibility out the windows in the back it’s not very good at all.￼ I do like the hatch back though because you have more room which is great for road trips.
3378, a year ago,5,These vehicles retain their re-sale value so well! They seem to work good and last a long time!

So comfy and reliable, I’ve never paid more than $25 to fill my tank and it lasts me about a week which is pretty good considering I’m constantly driving and doing deliveries. I get about 40 miles per gallon. My first Prius made it all the way to 300,000 miles and it’s still running."

3393,a year ago,5,"I love my Rav4.  It's the 2nd one I've owned.  It gets decent gas mileage,  is the perfect size for me now that the kids are grown, and is very comfortable to drive.  My 1st one had over 180,000 miles and required very few repairs.  I would probably still be driving it if it hadn't gotten hsil damage.  The one thing I had added to this one was a remote start for cold days"

3409, a year ago,5,"I drive a 2020 Toyota Hatchback and it’s an awesome car! The interior is so cool, I love the big media console. The seats are also sleek and very comfortable. I like that it is a very compact car. At work, I’m always delivering stuff, so I keep the backseats down and have a pretty big sized trunk space. I would really recommend this car!"
3410, a year ago,5,This is my second corolla. A highly reliable model and brand. Repairs are quick and easy. Ive only spent on a minor repair besides the usual maintenance since i got this car and it is 9 years old. Im the second owner and i totally enjoy driving it. Go for the Sport version if you can
3411, a year ago,4,"Obviously, Camrys are popular for a reason. They are reliable, comfortable, and intuitive."
3412, a year ago,5,I own a 2005 white Sequoia. It is very spacious & still runs great. My car has a CD player & it plays cassette tapes. This car is great for family trips & seats up to 7 people. The only thing I don’t like is the seatbelt for the middle person in the 3rd row. It oddly hangs from the ceiling.
3413, a year ago,5,Growing up we’ve always had Camry’s. They last a very long time & are very reliant. We have a 2005 Camry that my son drives & although the paint is chipped & it looks old it runs great. The A/C works perfectly & the car drives very smooth.
3414, a year ago,4,I have been in the older models & although I am not a fan of the body style the car runs great & is pretty spacious for its size. It also gets great gas mileage & from what I’m told it’s not too expensive.

3418, a year ago,5,When I needed w reliable car after I had my first child my husband had me go to Toyota and get a car that was reliable and safe me me and my newborn.  Ever since buying my first Corolla I am a Toyota for lifer.
3419, a year ago,2,"I’ve only been a passenger in this type of vehicle, never owned one. Seems to have a lot of issues and the ride itself is not a smooth one."
3420, a year ago,5,Have ridden in my daughters car many times and find it has a smooth ride. She hasn’t had any major issues with it.
3421, a year ago,5,"This is my everyday car. I’ve driven it to and from work, and have had plenty of road trips in this vehicle. Very pleased with this car. Toyotas might just be my favorite now. Oh I almost forgot to mention it’s amazing on gas."

3430, a year ago,5,"So I own a Toyota minivan, which I love. I go home to visit my Mom, she wanted to go shopping and insisted we take her car. My Mom owns a Toyota Camry. I was shocked on how smooth the ride was. It has a cool interior and a stylish body and omg, we drove everywhere and it didn’t even seem like we used any gas. We left with a full tank and came home with a full tank. You can not go wrong with a Toyota."
3431, a year ago,5,"I never thought I would ever own a minivan let alone a Toyota minivan but guess what I do. I love it! It has a cool look to it, it rides so smoothly and it doesn’t eat up the gas. I can drive a 6 hour road trip and not have to fill it up. You can’t go wrong with a Toyota!"
3432,a year ago,4,"In my opinion that’s the best car from this brand.
Don’t have even one bad thing to say.
There is nothing to improve, the 2020 corolla is great.
A little bit expensive but worth it."
3433, a year ago,5,A Toyota 4Runner was my very first vehicle I owned. I absolutely loved this vehicle and took great care of it. It had good mileage and was in great condition for a lot of years. I felt protected inside because it was a 4Runner. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that drives. It's a foreign made which is great.
3434, a year ago,5,"My husband drives a lot for work and this is the perfect choice as it is economical, super dependable and quite roomy"
3435, a year ago,5,This minivan is the most spacious minivan out there! So much room and rides like a cloud. The turning radius is one of the best features also! Our family loves this van.
3436,a year ago,5,"Surprisingly sturdy little car.  Never had an issue with this vehicle.  It survived New England winter.  The bumper are plastic so if dented they can be heated and popped right back out.  Quiet engine, create gas mileage,  stops on a dime.  Not the best family vehicle."
3437, a year ago,5,"Es un auto excelente de verdad, es de calidad y confort especialmente para una mujer! Es súper suave de manejar y muy estable... amo mi carro de verdad estoy muy feliz con este vehículo"

3441,a year ago,5,I love my Yaris! It’s compact small and comfortable for a college girl like me!! There is nothing bad I can say about this car! Had it for years and it never let me down!! I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is looking to buy a vehicle!
3442, a year ago,5,"A pesar de que es un auto un poco viejo, la verdad es que es muy bueno para aprender a manejar e incluso ir a la universidad, sirve para ir en carretera bastante bien siempre y cuando le hagas se servicio cuando es debido, es compacto no necesitas buscar un lugar grande de estacionamiento, el freno está muy suave como el acelerador, es muy cómodo y su volante no estorba si eres de estatura chica, es un auto bastante bueno para empezar a usar y agarrar confianza o a tus hijos enseñarles a manejar!!"
3443, a year ago,5,excellent and economical vehicle.  consumes very little fuel. I like It! excellent and economical vehicle.and I recommend it to everyone.
3444, a year ago,2," i have a toyota avalon lx its nice. i love it so does everybody around me. always going on the road or doing things for the family. nice and space, for more then three in the back specially long seat belts to handle what is needed. i have also delivered postal mail, in my car, parcels, to a whole route on one run. unless i have to do two depending on the parcels. other then that i can do three routes in my car. "

3447, a year ago,3,It’s a cute car and people love it. It doesn’t have many luxury features but it’s compact and energy efficient
3448,a year ago,5,"Being a single mom of 2 teenage-ish kids is already a whirlwind, but the space in this vehicle makes long trips easy. I love my Sequoia! "
3449, a year ago,3,"For the price of this car, it is a bit underwhelming. Toyota tends to be the last automaker to update the interiors. You’ll see 2017’s Kias and fords features in the 2020 models of Toyota. You’d be paying for the brand reputation. But nowadays these other cars are just as good, but you’ll get more for your dollar!"
3450, a year ago,5,"Spacious, affordable and luxurious. The pick up is nice and smooth. Driving this is the same both in summer and winter."
3451, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota Sienna. I have several kids and the features are so nice with kids, especially the power sliding doors and cargo in the back. One of the only things I would change is that I wish my van had Apple CarPlay. I always recommend the Sienna when people say they are in the market for a minivan. "
3452, a year ago,5,"Environmentally friendly, love the size, and budget friendly. Living in a city, this is easy to park and easy on my wallet."
3453, a year ago,3,"El Toyota Yaris es un automóvil del segmento B producido por el fabricante japonés Toyota. Existen tres generaciones, lanzadas en los años 1999, 2005 y 2011 disponibles con carrocerías hatchback de tres y cinco puertas y sedán de cuatro puertas. La primera generación fue votada Coche del Año en Europa en el año 2000."
3454, a year ago,5,"I like this car, the truth is it is the only one I have, it is good for traveling with my family"
3455, a year ago,5,"At first, of course, I lived the color and leather interior. Then the safety provided for my family and myself. Most of all the dependability of Toyota has made me a loyal customer since 1995. Toyota Highlander"
3456, a year ago,5,"My 2013 Toyota Corolla is the ultimate family car. We bought it brand new and it hasn't given us any  issues for the past 7 years. We have done our maintenance like oil changes often, undercoating, brake changes(only twice so far) and wipers changed, as well as tires seasonally. 

Highly recommend Toyota vehicles!"
3457, a year ago,4,Love my cute little car. So unfortunate that they don’t make these anymore bc I would love an upgrade. Great on gas and mileage
3458, a year ago,4,Dependable and great on gas. These things are workhorses and even feel luxurious if you get the LX package. Suspension is great feels like a cloud. Power is pretty punchy for sedans they’re right up their in speed and 1/4 mile times with the BRZ and FRS.
3459, a year ago,5,I love love love my Toyota Sequoia. I have had it 15 years and it is the best vehicle. I do keep up on the regular maintenance but I have not had any problems with it. It is so roomy and quiet inside. It has been through 2 kids and lots of dogs. I’ve driven it to multiple states and it is just a wonderful SUV to drive. It does u turns in the streets w/o having to do a 3 point turn. I really love my sequoia.
3460, a year ago,5,Oh I own a Toyota Camry XLE and I love it. So easy to drive and the gas is decent not super cheap but definitely not expensive at all.￼
3461,a year ago,4,Comfortable and nice car. Great for couples. Very roomy.  Those who are starting to learn to drive will also be a great option. Suitable for long distances.
3462,a year ago,5,Great reliable car ! My son owns one and only had to change brakes after a few year no issues at all
3463,a year ago,5,"Best car l can honestly say lve driven ! It’s reliable if has no mechanical issues at all ! Mines a 2010 corolla Ascent and lve had no mechanical issues at all touchwood ! compared to Holden , ford and other brands l don’t think ld ever buy another car unless it’s a Toyota"
3464, a year ago,4,"Nice car but a little to small and sporty for me. Have to use high-grade gas for it to run good, I do not like that."
3465, a year ago,1,"not the best on gas, but it’s a really good car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love the seats and radio a lot!"
3466, a year ago,5,"Toyota trucks are simply the best. What else can be said about the 4Runner. In places with extreme winter climates I hear people only drive Toyota’s and Subaru’s,m. I have a friend who has a Tacoma with 240,000 on it, original engine and still going strong. My next truck will def be either a Tacoma or a 4 runner"
3467, a year ago,5,Same concept as the Brz. I own the brz and they’re the exact same car ! Super cool.
3468, a year ago,5,"I have this car. I love so much. Besides being spacious, it has an innovative designer.  He is very economical."
3469,a year ago,5,Me encanta muchísimo este 4runner es un gran auto totalmente grande y espacioso... me gustaría andar en una de esas
3470,a year ago,5,"Me encantaría obtener este maravilloso auto, una belleza única y especialmente a la medida, quisiera andar en uno de esos es mi mayor sueño, este es una de mis grandes proyectos, ya que es espectacular y magnífico y digo que para mi está a mi altura"
3471, a year ago,4,"Nice car, very roomy. Perfect for a family car and not breaking the bank on spending on this car"
3472, a year ago,5,Great mid size Toyota! Can’t go wrong with a Camry. I did like the smoother body versions though. The new boxy version with sharper edges makes it a bit to robotic. When it comes to the ride though it is nice and smooth!
3473, a year ago,5,The Prius is fantastic as the original hybrid that basically began the movement! The newest versions are really comfortable. The “V” version has so much space that makes it super easy to grocery shop as well as get larger purchases from the big box stores.
3474, a year ago,5,You can’t beat a Carolla as a base car to get around in. It has a surprising amount of space in the back seats as well as a huge trunk. It is super safe and just an ease to manage.
3475, a year ago,5,The Sienna is so roomy! I love taking it for road trips! It is so easy to pack and so easy to bring the whole family. We have gone all over the south eastern and western part of the US. I highly recommend it!
3476, a year ago,5,I love the Rav4! My family has had a few now and the newest 2020 version is fantastic! The technology continues to advance to suit our needs each time!
3477, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my rav!!! This is the 3rd one I have had! I just can’t seem to find a better car! Definitely a must drive!
3478, a year ago,5,"I really miss my Toyota Corolla. I had one from when I was 16 until I was 22. It was the best car I ever owned. The gas mileage was amazing, it was small and easy to park, had a great turning radius, and just looked great."
3479, a year ago,5,You would be surprised that if you use this in turbo mode the Prius gets around lol so no one ever. I use this car because it gets 54 to the gallon and I live 30 mi from work so I spent $20 a week on gas if that
3480, a year ago,5,"Very good bus, safe and comfortable. It is spacious inside and has a large luggage rack. Excellent to go on a trip with the whole family."
3481, a year ago,5,"Excellent bus, easy to handle, does not take up much space. It has a high gas mileage. It is safe and comfortable for the whole family and friends."
3482,a year ago,4,"Sus asientos son muy cómodos, generalmente el viaje es agradable, se adapta a todos los ambientes, me gustan todos los modelos, todos sus colores en general.En todos lo auto que eh subido no tuve ningun problema, me encantan los Toyota, son de mis favoritos."
3483, a year ago,5,"I got a 2008 Prius in 2016 and I love this car. I can fit a ton in the back, which is great when I find bargains at estate sales and thrifting. Gas mileage is a plus. As long as you keep maintaining it the car will last for ever."
3484,a year ago,5,Many people have this car. There are different colors to choose from as well as different interiors if paid more. Car seats fit will in the back since they are slightly deep. Comfortable to drive in without issues so far.
3485, a year ago,5,"It is beautiful, I want it, I would love to have it, it is very beautiful and it will be very useful to meIt is beautiful, I want it, I would love to have it, it is very beautiful and it will be very useful to me"
3486, a year ago,4,"Toyota is overall a nice car, pretty much everyone I’ve been in I like. My favorite hands down is the Toyota Avalon, it’s way more room than the Camry but I honestly love them all. ￼"
3487, a year ago,5,You cannot go wrong with a Toyota! The MOST reliable car out there. I’ve had my Highlander since 2008 and never had any sorts of issues with it!
3488,a year ago,4,"Posee una cierta comodidad familiar, que empatiza con el ambiente y te hace el dia mas placentero.....😀😀"
3489, a year ago,4,"Excellent small suv. we can fit 2 car seats in the back, we wish it could fit 3. Big trunk for the size of the car, especially if you last the second row down. It’s a reliable car and we love it for that."
3490, a year ago,4,"Good car. Plenty of space, newer models are super heavy duty. Wish it came with a third row option. Very Smooth ride you can’t feel any bumps."
3491, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my Highlander. I have 3 car seats across on the second row and they fit in, the kids are comfy. Enough trunk room, but when the third row is up, it’s a little cramped but expected. I love my hidden console in the front and usually throw my bag in it. Overall great car and excellent value."
3492, a year ago,4,I enjoy the ride of a Toyota 4Runner. They seem like they would be good for winter driving and getting yourself out of bad situations. The Toyota price tags are pretty high and I would rather have a pickup then an SUV myself.
3493, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota tundra. I have the crew cab and can comfortably fit 5 adults. I have had it for almost 9 years and it still drives like it is brand new. Many have told me that the ride is more comfortable than a lot of luxury cars they have been in. This is my second tundra and I plan on driving it for a long time.
3494, a year ago,5,We totally love our Toyota RAV4! We bought it recently and have taken so many road trips! It's very smooth to drive and you don't feel the bumps..it gives a good mileage and is very easy and smooth to drive. Would highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a AWD and SUV car option!😁
3495, a year ago,3,"They're confi and it's a great brand, they're amazing cars I really like it but I don't know if have something bad it's good I like it and I can use one of this for my everyday run its ok I don't have bad things about it I recommend this car if you want something normal"
3496,a year ago,5,I've had this car for 5 years and I love it. I don't have any issues with it after putting lots of miles on it. I just had to replace the battery during the pandemic since I hadn't driven anywhere in a long time but the battery was 5 years old so that's to be expected. Love love love Toyota!
3497,a year ago,5,"I used this car for a couple of weeks when someone rear ended my car and I had to get a rental. I fell in love with it. It was just a beautiful car, comfortable, and got good gas mileage. I didn't want to return it. Lol"
3498, a year ago,5,"Excellent car, gas economic, so comfortable and trustworthy.. inside has seats so good and Large. My boyfriend has long legs and he fit so good, nice driving, soft, a/c is so good, nice looking, I have 3 years with my car and it looks so new yet"
3499, a year ago,5,"Best car ever!  We had a blue Sienna for 10 years! Man, that car toke my family everywhere, long and short distance and to work everyday, carrying so much weight (physically speaking) I could not believe it lasted 10 whole years! There is no price comparison when you get quality as in a Toyota!"
3500, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Toyota rav4. I feel super safe in my car. Love all the features and sunroof. It is the perfect size for me
3501,a year ago,4,"These are actually a fairly decent vehicle. Quiet, easy to control, but light weight. An inexperienced driver can run into difficulties with this vehicle because of said weight. Hydroplaning and catching wind buffers is a real risk. They have great lasting power though, and a pretty decent price point, especially when you consider the hybrid fuel offset."
3502, a year ago,5,I love my RAV4! Super excited for all the technology that is included! Love the way it drives and how safe I feel in it.
3503, a year ago,5,Luxurious car that’s easy to drive and handle. Definitely a grown up car with lots of cool features.
3504, a year ago,5,I’m on my third corolla haha. When it’s time for a new one I just get a corolla! Nice and zippy.
3505, a year ago,4,"The obvious biggie is gas mileage, up to 50 MPG when mostly interstate.  Fairly comfortable, decent technology. It's not winning time trials, but I knew that. Reliable, has 130k miles and has needed minimal maintenance, outside of routine oil change etc."
3506, a year ago,5,"This car is smooth sailing all around. The seats are also pretty comfortable, this coming from a 5’10 female. I could drive this car for HOURS and still be perfectly comfortable."
3507, a year ago,5,"This car is so versatile. I love the space and comfort of this vehicle. If you are looking for a reliable, comfortable and easy to drive car, Toyota 4Runner it is!"
3508, a year ago,5,"I have the Rav4 trail edition and LOVE it!!   The down side is that connectivity services are lacking in Canada,  as the apps for navigation and music etc. are not available here.  What this car lacks in tech, it makes up for in fuel economy, amazing handling on all types of terrain, good looks and reliability!"
3509, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota Yaris, its a great car. Confort, good mechanics, beautiful interior, nice champagne color, great in all ways. I recommend Toyota, is affordable and good quality. Its also easy to mantain."
3510, a year ago,5,Toyota RAV4 is an excellent car if you’re a smaller family and wanting something bigger than a car! I love mine and only reason I’m trading mine in soon is because my family has unfortunately grown out of it and we need a third row! All the safety features in this car is amazing!!!
3511,a year ago,4,I have a manual 2009 hatchback and it’s perfect for short trips around town at to use for driving to work. Wasn’t good for a long trip as mine doesn’t have cruise control so it was frustrating to drive a long distance. Good on fuel consumption and has quite a lot of boot space for a small car.
3512,a year ago,4,"I have had two different Toyota Camry's before, both the 2007 and 2017 models. Overall it is a very good car. Reliable, affordable, good gas mileage, and a sleek design. I am very short, and this car is low to the ground, so for me my biggest complaint was it is a little difficult for me to see sometimes, but if you are taller than 5'2"" you should be fine! All jokes aside, I did enjoy my Toyota Camry experiences. "
3513,a year ago,5,"I absolutely loved my camry , I was recently in a major accident 9/7/2020 and I have to say my car protected me and my family from serious bodily harm. There were so many airbags that the er dr said the injuries I had were minor compared to what he usually sees. I will never buy another car type than a toyota"
3514, a year ago,5,I miss my Toyota camry very cute small car. L loved it. Got me around for 2 years. No serious issues. Decent car to drive
3515, a year ago,4,"This car is perfect because it is a comfortable and spacious, looks very nice for the desing, it is not really expensive. It does not use much gasoline, the car has 4 dors but the problem with this type of cars is the alignment although it is not something that canot be fixed"
3516, a year ago,5,"My mom currently drives a Toyota Sienna. We have had it since 2005 and it still runs like new. Toyota is a great car company, and the quality of their cars are great. If I ever need a new car Toyota is on the top of my list."
3517, a year ago,5,"My Toyota Corolla is the best car I’ve ever owned. It’s extremely reliable, fuel efficient and really zippy around town. It’s super cheap to fill up, $50 a fortnight using premium fuel only. Would 100% recommend to anyone wanting to upgrade their car!
#toyotalife #corolla #toyotacorolla"
3518, a year ago,5,Love my corolla. My first car was a 96 and I now have a 2015 and it’s been the best.
3519, a year ago,5,It was an older car but it lasted a long time before I had to get a bigger vehicle kinda wish I still had it for days I don’t need a bigger car
3520, a year ago,5,"I didn’t buy this car, it was a gift from my parents when I first started how to drive so I will always associate it as a nice starter car. It’s not too large so definitely great for new drivers who aren’t planning on driving a big car."
3521, a year ago,5,I love Toyotas. Their steering wheels are so easy to control and move around. It takes very little effort to drive the car. The car is also really nice and looks really snazzy. Especially with it being such a reasonable price. I would totally buyt his car again.
3522, a year ago,5,"A Toyota 4Runner is a favorite of many! I can definitely understand why now that I’ve rode inside one. My significant other purchased one a year ago and I fell in love. They are nice looking, spacious inside and drive like a dream."
3523, a year ago,4,We test drove a 2020. It was nice but just plain. Backseat uncomfortable. My daughter has an older rav and there wasn’t much of a change from hers. We bought a Nissan Murano Platinum. We love it
3524, a year ago,5,One of my favorite cars they last forever. Great on gas. Perfect for a 1st car. I would 100 percent recommend. I would definitely buy from Toyota again. They are very reliable.  Very affordable.  Thank you for continuing on producing wonderful vehicles.

3528,a year ago,5,I will own another 4Runner eventually. The only reason I don’t drive one now is that I was ready to size down.
3529,a year ago,5,This is my second RAV4 and I love it. I prefer to drive the XLE model. This is definitely a sturdy SUV and the gas mileage is pretty good. It’s a great affordable option for a larger vehicle. I would recommend Toyota overall for a car.

3537, a year ago,4,Everyone knows that Toyota cars are highly dependable vehicles.  I never had any mechanical issues while I owned it.  The only thing that needs improvement is snow performance.  The tires that come with the car are supposedly all weather but it does not warrant good performance in the snow.

3556, a year ago,5,"I frequently ride in this vehicle as a passenger and am impressed overall. It’s a smooth ride. Additional accessories are impressive even on a base model. The customization options are fantastic. It’s out of my price range but if I could afford it myself, I’d buy this car."
3557, a year ago,5,My dad just got a 2016 version of this car! He is in love with it. It drives smoothly and doesn't give you any tension

3561, a year ago,4,I absolutely love my Toyota highlander. It’s a sport version of a mom car. Instead of a van we decided on a highlander. It still has a third row for the kiddos. It’s easy for the kiddos to get into. Would highly recommend one.
3562, a year ago,5,"I have a 2010 and I love it. I bought used and I have had no issues so far. Very reliable and simple,  a great car for a first time car owner like myself. Only thing is I wish the mileage was better. I hear it’s way better for later models but right now I am at 12 mpg."

So if your in the market for a used car in this case older may be better."
3568, a year ago,4,"Awesome car and would have given it 5 stars except it was missing a few things. Wish it had a bit more room, the seats are not comfortable if you are a taller person and the road noise is pretty loud. Overall great car, sleek design, great gas millage and intuitive smart phone functionality."

3576,a year ago,3,"A very small car that is very well built, not very comfortable but very good when it comes to saving fuel, also with a design that makes it look like a sports car from the high ranges of cars on the market."
3577, a year ago,4,Very gas efficient which is the major plus on the vehicle. In my opinion it’s the only plus and the reason for the 4 stars. It’s not the safest or fastest vehicle and not my favorite.

3579,a year ago,5,"I love love love my car! I had a 2017 RAV4 that was totaled after being hit in the back end and after I went ahead and got me a 2018 RAV4 with more options! I would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody! Great price, lots of options, lots of room, and easy to drive and park!"

3590, a year ago,5,I love my 2014 Toyota Corolla. A great first time car for anyone who wants something reliable.
3591,a year ago,5,"Carro lindo, seguro, un poco aburrido de manejar, pero sabes que estás comprando algo que te va a durar y que es seguro y confiable"
3592, a year ago,5,One of my longest lasting vehicles. This little car was able to last me a long time and hardly ever had any issues!

3595, a year ago,4,"I had a Corolla for 9 years... I bought mine used for college and drove it into the ground. Amazing value considering how much wear and tear I put on it. I need a bigger car now, but for a sedan it was fabulous. Great gas mileage and I always felt safe in it"

3600,a year ago,5,I used to have a rav4 and absolutely loved it. I miss it! It drove so smooth and was very trusting
3601, a year ago,4,"I have the sport and I have to say that the seats are a bit uncomfortable. It’s great with gas don’t have to fill my tank up often, I put gas every 2 weeks. The price hmm I guess it’s worth it since hopefully it’ll last for years. Would I recommend yes I would it’s economical for sure."
3602, a year ago,5,"My car is the new 2020 Toyota Camry, and I LOVE IT ! The Apple car feature and the blind spot monitor is definitely helpful in my opinion. It is relative affordable and it’s a great daily driver that helps with commuting to and from college."
3603, a year ago,5,I love my RAV4 it has so much space compared to my Corolla and ive had no problems with it
3604, a year ago,5,Nice  cars and very  reliable and safe to drive in. Good reputation Toyota Camry. Comes in all colors.

3606, a year ago,5,"this car has never let me down. It's light on fuel, it's part aren't that expensive and it gets me to my destination without fail."
3607,a year ago,4,I owned a Toyota Camry in the past and my parents have had two different older editions as well. I love the styling of the cars and the only downside for me was power since I had always had a V6 car before. Still love them as they are very durable and functional!
3608,a year ago,4,Love this vehicle! Drives like a truck but has the flexibility for extra storage as an SUV. It feels like this car could get through almost any weather you would throw at it! The TRD Pro is my favorite and I hope to own one myself later in my life. I highly recommend any Toyota product as they are very durable and functional.
3609, a year ago,5,"If you are looking for a car, this is the one to get. I learned how to drive in a Camry that was probably at least 20 years old, and it was still in perfect shape. I ended up buying a Camry of my own a few years later and I loved it. The only reason I sold it was because at that point I had 2 kids in car seats, and it was just way too small! But this is a super reliable, dependable, and safe car. And the newer ones have even more safety features and an updated, more modern design. Great vehicle!"
3610, a year ago,4,"Before I bought my Chevy Traverse, this was the car I was leaning toward. I wanted something with a 3rd row, and having had a Camry for years, I really wanted another Toyota. Unfortunately, the 3rd row was just too small. I expect a 3rd row to be smaller than most, but this one was almost unusable. There wasn’t a lot of headspace either, so if you’re tall, you might be uncomfortable in this. It drove really nicely though, and it is definitely a good looking car. And you really can’t beat Toyota for their safety features and reliability. Just wasnt for me!"
3611, a year ago,4,"Before I bought my own car, I had been a passenger in a rav4 and it was always the car I thought I would buy. When I went to test drive it, however, it wasn’t for me. You can’t go wrong with a Toyota, but this just felt really small and I was hoping for a little more room in the back for my kids (I have 2 still in booster seats). But for someone without kids, I think this would be a great car!"
3612, a year ago,5,"MY FIRST car, I love this one, It is very easy to drive and and my cost on oil is really small. I enjoy driving with my friend.  "

3623, a year ago,5,"Reliable, comfortable and very stylist. I drove these when they cans out in the 90’s. And the newer ones have so many options available to customize the vehicle."
3624, a year ago,5,This is a reliable car. I’ve owned this model since 2006 and continue to purchase this car. I even bought my son his first RAV4 for his 18th birthday.
3625, a year ago,5,I love my camry! It gives me GREAT gas mileage with a full tank in it. Love the color of it and I love the precollision sensor and lane departure assist. Super safe car.
3626, a year ago,4,"I recently purchased a used 2015 Toyota Carolla S with 117km's on her. Having had the proper maintenance from her previous owner she still runs perfectly. Toyota has a good reputation for making long lasting reliable cars, and of you're buying used I would recommend checking out your nearest Toyota dealership.
She's a safe and comfortable rides which gets me from point A to point B and she looks pretty cute too."
3627, a year ago,4,Loved it but it was a rental so really did not get a feel for the whole ownership experience. I would consider buying one though.
3628, a year ago,5,Being that this is my first car i am in love with this car. Its still a pricey car but not that pricey if that make any sense.
3629,a year ago,5,This is a really great brand. I’ve driven it personally quite a few times. Rides very smooth
3630, a year ago,5,Great everyday car. A lot of Uber drivers use this car and it is very reliable. The gas usage is not bad either.
3631, a year ago,5,This car is great on gas. It was my very first car and does not take much to fill the tank at all.
3632, a year ago,4,I had a Camry for a while and it was a great car for quite a while. I felt it was roomy for a small car. But I definitely prefer a van over this.
3633, a year ago,5,"It has a class-leading predicted reliability rating, an intuitive infotainment system, a cushioned ride, and good mpg ratings. It's available as a four-door sedan and as a hatchback, and both body types come standard with lots of safety features through the Toyota Safety Sense suite. Toyota Corolla Toyota Motor Company"

3641, a year ago,5,"I love my Camery . When I was “growing up “ I had a Nissan & it broke down so fast , I was so hesitant to go to Toyota & My Aunt said they are good cars . I was like fine - so I did . And I don’t regret it one bit . I have had 2 last I traded in my 2012 for a 2014 . And have had it since . Keep up on the maintenance etc.  . ￼"
3642, a year ago,4,I really like my Toyota RAV4 however mine is an older one (2010) which I believe was one of the last years it actually looked like a SUV instead of a sports wagon. The biggest problem for me though is that since it’s not a full size SUV I find it lacks head room and the seat doesn’t go back far enough (the reason I knocked off 1 star). I really recommend Toyota products in general we have 4 different ones within our family.
3643, a year ago,4,Have been a passenger in many Toyota Prius’s as they are mainly driven by Uber drivers and must say they are comfortable and quiet.
3644, a year ago,4,"I have a Toyota Sienna 2018 minivan i love it It has a powerful engine, a roomy and comfortable interior, and the best predicted reliability rating in the segment. However, it has ponderous handling, and its safety scores are unimpressive compared to most classmates."
3645, a year ago,4,"My first(and only) car. I like not having to go to the gas station much but I hate how slow it accelerates. There’s nothing wrong with it to me, but I’m also not much of a car person. It’s served me well enough."
3646,a year ago,4,"Nice car and efficient. Not to bad on the road, good with gas as it seems and I like the space and the outlook of it."
3647, a year ago,5,"For a midsized family car you can not go wrong with a camry.  We have owned 3 in our family.  I wished the gas mileage was a little better but overall on the highway it is not that bad.  The SAFETY features on the Camry are hard to beat.  I think by me stated that we have had 3, it's obvious that I would recommend or purchase again.  It's a given!!! Toyota Camry"
3648, a year ago,5,"While coming from a Toyota Rav4 to the Highlander was a nice upgrade.  The Highlander is a very smooth comfortable ride.  There is very minimal road noise which makes things even more pleasant.  With the safety measure, added options and trade-in values you seriously can not go wrong with this purchase.  I always recommend this vehicle to my friends Toyota Highlander"
3649, a year ago,4,I loved my 4 runner. It was an automatic transmission. 4 door power everything. 4 wheel drive with ABS and the cup holders were on point. Held my kids and was safe would own another one.v
3650, a year ago,4,"The first car I really drove - this was a smooth and easy ride. I recall friends commenting on the stereo having great sound, but there aren’t too many other perks that set it aside at the base level. It is a reliable car and that makes it worth it."

I replaced it with a Toyota Prius Prime. I’ve had good experiences with Toyota Care, maintenance at Toyota dealerships, and it held its value super well for my insurance assessment when it was totaled."
3671, a year ago,5,"A Toyota 4-runner use to be my favorite vehicle of all times.  I liked the convience of a 4x4 along with the option to drive in 2wheel drive.
I wished the inside was a little more roomier, which is ultimately why I switched to the Honda Pilot.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone really.  It holds it's trade-in value, however it's not the most comfortable vehicle for long legged or tall bodies."
3672, a year ago,5,I am on my 2nd Corolla. Upgraded from a 2013 to a 2019. I love the style of them and the great gas mileage. Mine came in tbe galactic blue color which is really a neat color sometimes it looks dark blue othee times it looks black.

3676, a year ago,5,"The best car in terms of saving gas. One time we spent like 80 bucks on gas on 10h trip from Sacramento (CA) to Las Vegas (NV). SO SAVES YOUR MONEY. Trust me. Just consider a new model. Because ours is 2011. If you look for an affordable car choice, this is the way to go."

3707, a year ago,4,"My friend had one of these in college and I was lucky enough to drive it one day. It is like driving a tank, full of blind spots and so much higher than other cars (I’m a smaller car girl generally). It was still fun to drive though! Felt like driving a toy haha big knobs on the dash, etc."
3708, a year ago,5,My best friend had a highlander until just last week and she loved it! It was over a decade old and she still got a decent pay out at car max for it - she said someone was trading in their Mazda of the same age and got $2k less than what she got for hers 😳 clearly Toyotas hold their value
3709, a year ago,5,"Boyfriend has a Toyota Prius - has actually had two- and lives it! Comfortable car, good gas miles, better for the environment, reliable brand that holds its value - great purchase!"

3712,a year ago,5,"Best car, we’ve got a 2008 with 110,000 miles on it and it still runs great. Will last a long time too. The only thing I don’t like is the features are rather outdated, even for a 2008."

3722, a year ago,5,I absolutely love this car. It is great on gas and being a college student this helps out much more than one knows. I would improve it by adding a feature that lets you move the side mirrors with touching them.
3723, a year ago,5,"I own a convertible Solara, top down is hands down my favorite way to be! Messy hair is a con but pro is it feels like a mini amusement park experience driving along and jamming to music 🎶. Highly recommend."

3734, a year ago,4,Had a highlander back when there was no third row. It was awesome. I went to the dealer to drive a rav 4 and was unimpressed. Walked away with a highlander. Another car that lasted a loooooong time. I am less fond of the more recent versions
3735, a year ago,5,I loved my Rav 4. Very spacious. Good on gas. Low maintenance. It is definitely a car I would consider buying again .

3745, a year ago,4,My husband drives a Camry because he travels for work. It has good gas mileage and has really put up with a lot of miles day in and day out without missing a beat. I do not like that the middle seat in the back is mounded. It’s impossible to keep a booster seat on it.
3746, a year ago,4,Mine was made back in 2013 and silver but she’s lasted me since my freshman year of college! She can accelerate slow sometimes but is known for conserving gas so during these economic times she’s been nothing but good to me
3747, a year ago,5,I love my car! It drives well and great mileage. The bucket seats in mine are really comfy and I love that I had the option to get a sport one
3748, a year ago,5,"I’ve never reviewed a car so I’m not sure what to say, but I love it! I really like how my car handles, everything about it is super nice."

3754, a year ago,5,I’ve owned a Toyota Camry in the past I had it from 1995 till around 2007… Camry is known for its smooth ride and it never lost a smooth ride the entire time it’s also very cost-efficient… I would definitely recommend if anyone needs a four-door sedan to buy this vehicle ￼
3755, a year ago,4,Overall happy with the car; it’s a solid compact car that has decent gas mileage and aesthetically acceptable. Also came with a two year warranty from Toyota care that has covered maintenance costs.
3756, a year ago,5,"We have a black 2019 TRD Off-road. It’s sparkly black, dependable and bad assssssssssss"
3757,a year ago,5,"I have a '96 Toyota Camry. I bought it at 169,000 miles for $1,350. What a steal! I've owned the car for over a year, and it is exactly what I need it to be. It is reliable and gets good gas mileage. I will say that the door handles are problematic on this vehicle. They tend to break easily. They aren't too hard to replace and are fairly cheap, but I will say that I wish they didn't fall apart so quickly. Other than that, it's a great car, and I expect it to last a long time. #car #toyota #camry #vehicle #sweetride"

3775, a year ago,5,"A very reliable, long lasting car. You can't go wrong with Toyota, their cars will last you a life time. The maintenance is fairly reasonable and the car will give you minimal issues, compared to the more high end cars like bmw. If you're looking for value you can't go wrong with the highlander."
3776, a year ago,5,"My cousins drive RAV4s and they love them, especially the newer model. They are super room and have great trunk space. Feels like a luxury car inside with super nice interior. From what I hear they also hold up very well!"

3778, a year ago,2,Purchased a 2008 Toyota Yaris as my second car. While it was a reliable vehicle with a lot of life in it I was not a fan. The vehicle is so small there was no leg room or space within the trunk for storing things. I also found throughout winter months and windy days this vehicle was blown all over the roads as it is so light
3779, a year ago,5,Amazing car. Toyota are the best and hold a lot of value. I can’t complain at all. It’s my second Toyota

3819, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota Highlander! I bought it in 2017 and have had no issues with it. My only complaint is that the base model only came within light interior and having kids makes it hard to keep the seats clean. The third row seating is great and easy. The car is roomy for the most part. With the third row down you can fit 8 people. I have gotten so many compliments on my car. The Highlander is a bit pricy but worth it to me.

3822, a year ago,5,I had a 1995 4Runner and absolutely loved it! The body style and the materials used for that body style they seemed to be durable and were able to withstand lots of wear and tear. I did everything in this vehicle and if I could get the same concept and build on a new model I would be ecstatic! Was by far my most loved vehicle!Toyota Motor Company

3831, a year ago,5,After having another child I wanted to get a bigger vehicle. I got my highlander and I love it! Very roomy. Only bad part is if you have the third row up there isn’t much “trunk” space. But I do love how the middle row moved forward or back to make more room for either the middle row or third row passengers. Also very neat how in the middle row the middle seat can be removed and replaced with a center piece that has cup holders.
3832, a year ago,5,Great little car and it is also great on gas as well it’s a lot smaller for my liking but personally I’m not a car person but it’s a pretty great and reliable vehicle so I would highly recommend if you are looking to purchase one

3844, a year ago,5,"4Runner has always been a dream SUV of mine and after getting a dog we realized how badly we would need it for longer car journeys.  I am absolutely in love with my 2016.  It’s got plenty of upgrades so I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything, and I actually like how it drives better than the 2020 model.  It’s a pretty smooth ride for an SUV and it’s very easy to drive.  Seats are comfortable and it doesn’t feel like a huge gas guzzler."
3845, a year ago,5,It’s a very nice car. I like how it looks and how comfortable the seats are in it. It’s a good starter car.
3846, a year ago,4,"We own a sienna and we love it. The leg space is good, trunk is spacious and deep for more storage. Seats are easy to fold in so you have more space if you are traveling and need space for luggage. Mileage is good. Interior is not very luxurious but not bad for a family van."
3847, a year ago,5,"Es increíble la manera en la que se puede manejar este producto, me encanta bastante y me es bastante útil y cómodo para cada día, recomiendo bastante su uso a todos los usuarios, para que usen esta maravilla"
3848, a year ago,5,I’ve had my 4Runner for 2 weeks and couldn’t be happier with it!! Yes it’s not as good on gas as my previous car but I was willing to let that go for the versatility and adventure side I could use the 4Runner for.

3855, a year ago,5,"Such a cute car. This Camry has great gas mileage, which I need since its a daily driver for my fiancé. It has plenty of space. The trunk also has quite a bit of space. For some reason I like more aesthetic looking dashboards and I'm not the biggest fan of this dash but the car itself is a great little car. We have a 2011 with only 60K miles!"
3856, a year ago,4,"It is a great car with good gas mileage. I like how smooth it transitions and nothing interior has damaged over the years. I wish that the trunk could be opened with the key, and that the key could open the car instead of relying on a battery operated fob."

3866,a year ago,5,Favorite car by far! Love not having to pay 60$ for a tank of gas. And I usually only have to fill up 1x a month. Don't let anyone tell you the Prius is not a good car. it's great and can be speedy

3869, a year ago,5,I really like my Rav4. It’s sits up high enough that I can see everything on the road but it’s not a giant suv. I can fit in all my things including the pups! Haven’t had any problems with it so far
3870,a year ago,5,"For a rollerskate on wheels the Yaris is an incredibly comfortable ride. Smooth, zippy, and comfortable as can be. It may be small, but it doesn't lack comfort and even the basic model isn't without perks. If you want a great car with exceptional gas mileage, this is it."
3871, a year ago,5,My best friend just got one of these I believe it’s a 2017 and it’s amazing! It has a charging pad to charge your phone and you phone Bluetooths right to the car! The dash borad looks futuristic and it’s so quite we didn’t even realize it was running! Not to mention it’s got amazing gas mileage and really good for the environment! ￼

3873, a year ago,5,Toyota Camry this was the best car I’ve ever owned. I’ve had my Camry longer than any other vehicle until I totaled it about a year ago. The best part of the story is I walked away without a scratch.
3874, a year ago,5,"I love my car. I just bought it this year and it truly feels like a luxury car. The best part of this car is all the safety features it has to offer. Blind Spot assistance, reverse camera, automatic braking, and lane assistance. It is a smaller SUV yet super spacious. A perfect mom car!!!"
3875, a year ago,5,I love my 4 runner and do not think anyone could change my mind on any Toyota. I will drive mine till the wheels fall off and then I will probably go with another.
3876, a year ago,3,"I always grew up having bigger cars; so when I started regularly riding in a corolla it was a bit weird! But honestly, that's my only complaint. Otherwise it's a reliable, durable car."
3877, a year ago,4,This car is incredibly reliable. The only issue is it can be a little bit of a gas guzzler because of its size. Other than that it's very safe and durable.
3878, a year ago,5,"Lots of trunk space, big enough to fit both of my children’s car seats with room to spare in between them. Lots of leg room for my husband who is 6’5 as well! I think it’s reasonably priced, and will stick with Toyota for its quality as well. Toyota Motor Company"
3879, a year ago,4,A good expensive car for a family 7-8 persons feels luxurious insides the vehicle. 🤗
3880, a year ago,4,We have owned a couple of Toyota Corollas over the years and both have been sturdy and trustworthy cars. They are hard to kill and require very little in the way of repairs. Regular maintenance goes a long way toward keeping them that way and if you do need to repair them the parts are generally not terribly expensive. I would totally recommend Toyota brand vehicles to my friends and family as they tend to keep their resale value as well.  Toyota Motor Company Toyota Corolla 
3881,a year ago,5,"This car is so amazing!!!! The features are incredible, pros everything is electric, hands free! Cons i would add backseat cup holders. The drive is so smooth and easy I highly recommend! Even if its a test drive, give it a try! You may fall in love!"
3882, a year ago,5,"This was a good purchase. No buyers regret here. We have a 2011 and it just went over 100,000 miles. We just had the 100,000-mile tune-up, service, and maintenance. The mechanic who was a Toyota Master Mechanic told us the car was well taken cared of and the engine might be just broken in. When we picked up the vehicle after the service we notice a quicker start-up and quicker 'giddy-up' and go. We do use all Toyota parts and fluids on the vehicle and we do change the oil every 3500 miles and we will continue to do so, which I think is a key to a reliable vehicle. The car is used for my wife and I and our two dogs. we are very comfortable taking long road trip to the out-banks or DC. The AC has always worked just fine, the temperature control has worked each and every time in various climates. We have gone through three tire changes since we have had the vehicle and one front end alignment at the 100,000 service and maintenance; the car drives very well. Again the care is comfortable and reliable."
3883, a year ago,1,I do not like this car. Small and don’t feel so safe in it. It is definitely affordable. The safety features could improve this product. I would not recommend this product. Happy Shopping 🛍

3888, a year ago,5,"The 2020 is amazing. With the Apple car play integration and the mileage, it’s the perfect affordable car. Will totally rent again."
3889, a year ago,4,"The overall experience in the car was great. The drive was nice and smooth and handling of the car was good as well. The infotainment system on the Camry I drove had Apple CarPlay which was great to see since it didn’t have a navigation package. The downside to the car was how light it felt, if I took a turn too hard the car would skid and it felt like it wouldn’t take too much to get it to roll."
3890, a year ago,3,"It’s a great car, very reliable. When it comes to car I am not blinded by the brand names etc Amd I want to look at it in terms of functionality and this is great"

3893, a year ago,5,"We purchased our Prius used, from a family member.  We did not set out to buy a Prius (our previous vehicle died at a really inopportune time!) but the calculated savings in gas more than paid for the Prius on a monthly basis.  We have yet to have the first issue with the car in over 5 years of owning it.  My husband is 6’6” and there is plenty of headroom and legroom for him.  We love our Prius and would absolutely consider purchasing another!"

3900, a year ago,5,Love my rav4. I just traded in my 2017 for the 2020 model. It’s a great Vehicle if you want and suv but prefer it to be on the smaller side. A lot of room in the backseat for car seats and large trunk space !
3901, a year ago,3,I had a 4 runner and I loved it but I love my Kias price compared to the Toyota 4 runner but it has all the bells an whistles
3902, a year ago,5,"The car has lasted very nicely since 2011, Toyota is honestly one of the best brands to buy. I had a recall took it to the dealership and they fixed it no trouble. The car brand can be a little pricy but it's worth it, it is a car that will last. I would definitely recommend this brand."

3940, a year ago,5,"Es un excelente auto, muy cómodo y seguro, puede entrar a terrenos algo difíciles, cuenta con excelentes tipo de colores, cuenta con un tapiz en tela impermeable de alta resistencia, también con un sensor de recerva y control de crucero"
3941, a year ago,4,Nice looking car. Spacious inside and smooth on the road. Can’t go wrong with a Toyota.
3942, a year ago,5,"Powerful car, elegant, comfortable. Good design, the letter seats are soft and nice. High techno on the system. I love this car."
3943, a year ago,4,Wonderful small suv to drive around in. Easily pushed around in Oklahoma wind lol incredible gas mileage and does well on long trips! Very affordable!
3944, a year ago,5,Amazing vehicle. Our family is 5 of us with 3 boys and it had so much room. The full a/c system was my favorite part. One of the smoothest riding vehicles I’ve ever driven on the highway and the gas mileage is amazing!
3945, a year ago,5,I have had this car for a few months after having a Ford Focus for years (we’re not going to go there). I have not had any issues with this vehicle and it came very highly recommended when I was looking for a new car. Love this car!
3946, a year ago,5,"With 3 kids, this van suits my needs perfectly.  I can haul a lot of people and cargo.  It is as roomy as an SUV but gets better gas mileage."
3947, a year ago,5,I really like this kinda vehicle. Great ac. Smooth running. Smooth body. Great on gas. Its very very nice.
3948, a year ago,5,"Toyota Highlander are SO NICE! Mt mom has one, and she bought it because not only does it have SO much room, and ALL of the seats fold down and a backup camera but she also bought it because she has major back pain issues and this SUV drives smooth! Great SUV, it eats potholes for breakfast!"
3949, a year ago,5,"Toyota Camry are good af vehicles! They're very reliable, and last forever, I feel like. They also provide a smooth ride as well, I know this because my mother has back pain and the last car she bought was a Camry because it was easier on her back. Now she has a  Toyota Highlander, which I'll review in a minute. 💖"
3950, a year ago,5,THIS IS THE BEST CAR AROUND. It was my first car and I still have it all these years later. The car itself is 17 years old. It has 280k+ miles on it. It’s had its issues towards the more recent years. But it didn’t start having ANY crazy issues until very recently. And even then it wasn’t anything crazy. I absolutely love Celicas!
3951, a year ago,4,"Me encanta es cómodo , amplio grande y es camioneta y yo la amo por su precio y colores"
3952, a year ago,5,"I have the rav 4 2020 xle in lunar rock color, which I love. I get a lot of compliments on the color of my car. The only disappoint is that the new xle don’t come with a sunroof unless you add it on for extra. The xle 2019 do. It’s a spacious car and nice style. As a tallish girl (5’7) I love the height. I’ve already done a lot like move my friends big desk and packed the car for a camping trip. During my buying journey I was between the Subaru crosstreck or this rav 4. I love that I picked a car with more space as I was hesitant at first about having a big car. Worth it!"
3953, a year ago,5,I love my car. It’s a 2018 Toyota Rav 4 and I was blessed with it two years ago from my mother when I graduated high school with my associates degree. I love how much load it can carry and also the color of it. It’s a dark gray and I’ve named it storm! It drives so smooth and the speaker system is truly amazing. You’ll ultimately be saving on gas too
3954, a year ago,5,"Another rental. It was a 2019 Toyota Camry sport (I think). Very spacious vehicle. Smooth ride (watch speedometer). Love the fuel efficiency. Drove to Athens, OH and Cincinnati. Drove back to Columbus, OH...only used a half of tank of gas. (Did Well Over The Speed Limit...👀🤫)."
3955,a year ago,4,It’s safe drives well and is relatively low maintenance. Getting repairs when needed was easy enough. Had this car for a long time and would have lasted longer if I wasn’t hit when parked. Great car!
3956, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Corolla is a nice car like a Honda very reliable. Good on gas, good for long drives."
3957, a year ago,5,"Cuenta con mucho balanceo y equilibrio entre todos sus cambios y velocidades, el equipamiento lo hace seguro y bastante cómodo"
3958, a year ago,5,"Me encanta este carro, es súper cómodo, su carrocería lo hace muy elegante, pero al mismo tiempo sencillo"
3959, a year ago,4,They are solid but when my radio stopped working it was 700$ to fix. Wasn’t covered under warranty
3960, a year ago,3,Old corolla where solid and dependable the new one I had burned oil and the dealership/ Toyota did nothing to help
3961, a year ago,5,Estos caros son un clásico no mueren súper económicos son espaciosos fácil de mantener
3962,a year ago,4,"Safe car ! Great to drive, I really enjoy how it handles in different weather ! The size is compact yet has plenty of room."
3963, a year ago,5,"Great car, fuel efficient and doesn't break down a lot especially if taken for regular servicing.The automatic transmission model is great if you're not a manual fan, affordable and great for long distance travel too."
3964, a year ago,5,All of my exes had one! Not comfortable but have lots of memories with them so it remains 5/5
3965, a year ago,5,"Easy to drive, also easy on your budget doesn't conssume a lot of petrol, automatic transmission which is great for me, wouldn't make any improvements."
3966, a year ago,5,"Una auto elegante, moderno y cómodo. Es un gusto viajar en él, además da una seguridad incomparable pues es uno de los mejores calificados en las pruebas de choques, y para mi eso es importante sobretodo al viajar con niños. Si recomiendo este auto."
3967, a year ago,5,Very comfortable to drive and the space is incredible.  This vehicle is perfect for long road trips with friends.
3968,a year ago,4,"Smooth and quiet ride, ergonomic cabin layout, adult-friendly backseat, perfectly flat load floor makes it an excellent cargo hauler."
3969,a year ago,4,"Good car, lasts a good while before it needs a charge. Windshield isn’t reliable as it’s cracked twice from minuscule things (rocks, heat)."
3970, a year ago,5,"Reliable, stylish, and safe to drive. I absolutely enjoy my low maintenance car. It’s big enough for a family but small enough for just me to drive clients around. Toyota RAV4"
3971, a year ago,4,A good practical car that is by far the BEST on gas. Low tire pressure is often a problem for the car even though all tires are new and not low at all the working sign dings. Also i love that they notify you if you don’t have your seatbelt on but the ding on the Camry is SO annoying it forces you to put your seatbelt on. Overall great car
3972, a year ago,5,I sat in the back of my parent’s RAV4 and had plenty of room! My sister owns one and has 1 kid in a booster and 2 in car seats and they all fit perfectly fine inside. I would definitely recommend this as a family car
3973, a year ago,5,Super reliable (as most Toyota’s are) and great for the family without looking like one. Road noise is a little loud in my car’s year but I’ve learned to get over it. I can still hear my kids and the radio. These SUVs hold their value really well so they might be a bit expensive even for an older model but sometimes there’s the diamond waiting for you at the right price and a clean car
3974, a year ago,5,"Of the best.Quite inexpensive, the parts are durable and inexpensive.Fuel consumption is pretty decent.Spacious despite being a sedan, the seats are comfortable.Try to keep maintenance up to date (oil change, air
conditioning check).If you have the opportunity and the budget, get full extras.











I recommend it."
3975, a year ago,5,Loved my 2002 Toyota Corolla!! It was very valuable as well as a great car to drive! It had very good gas mileage only took $20 to feel the gas tank and wasn't even expensive to fix or repair! I definitely recommend Toyota gear car!
3976,a year ago,5,"My dad just got a highlander that i drive often and its wonderful! Drives so smooth and its a toyota so you know it will last forever,"
3977, a year ago,5,My 1994 Toyota 4Runner is a classic beast. It still runs and shows no signs of stopping. Definitely a car that was built to last and has minimal issues and when it does they tend to be easy cost friendly fixes.
3978, a year ago,5,"Great size, easy driving, reliable, low maintenance. It doesn’t drive as smooth as my spouses Acura, but it’s a great ride."
3979, a year ago,5,"This was my first car, absolutely the best super safe and super easy to use. Recommend this to anyone who’s new to driving or looking to get their first car!"
3980,a year ago,5,We bought this car new about two years ago it is a great size of the car￼. It drives super nice and is not feel very big for driving￼.

3982, a year ago,5,"I love my car. It’s sleek, and it gets great gas mileage! Haven’t had any cons and I’ve had this car for 10 years, I love it"
3983, a year ago,3,The driving is not as smooth compared to other cars that I’ve used. The gas and brake pedal are very jerky and you have to apply quite a bit of pressure for both. The plus side is that it’s small and easy to park.
3984,a year ago,5,"Es una marca de automóvil muy buena, uno de mis primos compró uno y es súper bueno, y muy muy lindo, y si es tu primer carro, creo que es perfecto para ti, así que cuando te sientas preparado para comprarlo ve y hazlo, te puedo decir que no te arrepentirás"
3985, a year ago,4,"I'm my house we have a Toyota Camry from 1998 , and never stop working for a serius problem, the auto parts are easy to find. It's like my fathers baby. XD"

3987, a year ago,5,I’m in love with this car🥰 Has a basic mechanic so it’s not difficult for do some jobs on it. Had a great motor💪🏻
3988, a year ago,5,Love my Highlander. Not a ton of room in back but it is a small SUV. My only dislike is the middle console. Huge empty space. I would prefer the 4 cup holders like the previous style. And always could use more cell phone chargers!
3989, a year ago,5,I have the 2020 Toyota RAV4 XLE premium and I love it. I went from a 2007 Camry to this and this car is such a luxury.  I love the screen and the leather seats. Also I get amazing gas mileage for this to be a SUV. I have the lunar rock color and I get so many compliments. I don’t think I will get rid of this car unless I needed to. I LOVE IT.
3990, a year ago,5,i love my camry! its very nice and easy to keep in good shape! i highly recommend a camry! i love traveling in my camry!
3991, a year ago,5,"We got last year this CHR Toyota Hybride 2019.. Its so powerfull car and easy to drive we choose for automatic,did i mention how comfortabel is this car.we got some small pimp up like black #TOYOTA  #cars #hybride"
3992, a year ago,3,"This was my sister’s first car, it got her places but it was basic so no automatic windows and you could feel the car frame was light when speeding on the highway. It is a great commuter car but not long distance. She had it for almost 200,000 miles so it did a great job for her."
3993, a year ago,5,"I have a 2010 Toyota Corolla. It is the most dependable car I’ve ever owned. All I’ve had to do is keep up routine maintenance and change out the cv joints. This car is also a gas saver! I get about 35 miles per gallon. The only thing I would change is put vents in the back to help circulate the AC and some more space in the back seat area would be great. Overall, hands down this is the best car I’ve ever owned!"
3994,a year ago,5,fun smart and sleek. handles really well. one of my favorite go to vehicles. thankful my cuz lets me drive hers
3995,a year ago,4,"love love love the 4 runner for trails, hauling the boat and throwing the dogs in for a ride."
3996,a year ago,5,"really great family vehicle, can seat up to 8, 4wd, captain seat options, plenty of storage, handles all the curves"
3997,a year ago,4,"definitely delivers, perfectly incognito and versatile. i enjoy driving one for a couple years."
3998,a year ago,3,"the step below the camry. still delivers just not at the same capacity. its much smaller, so dont try to put anything large in it."
3999,a year ago,5,"the camry always delivers whether its speed, space or versatility. one of my favorite buys, no matter the year."
4000,a year ago,4,"Not that Many problems , I had to change the tire once or twice but overall really good car"
4001,a year ago,5,"Affordable car, parts are easily available. Smooth drive. Great space. Comfort. Low maintenance car. Gives good mileage. Good resale."
4002, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my Toyota Highlander Hybrid. It’s the first car I have owned that I actually enjoy driving. The seats are comfortable, the ride is smooth and it’s quiet. I love the lane departure feature and cruise control that adjusts based on the distance of the car in front of you. It was more expensive than other options, but totally worth it."
4003, a year ago,5,"A Toyota Corolla is an amazing car for a beginner driver. It is reliable and safe , you can have this car for years and it will still run ."
4004, a year ago,5,This car is very easy to drive as it is a very light car and honestly it’s so easy for someone like me since I cannot drive cars where the front of the car is long!! It’s a small car but extremely roomy!!
4005, a year ago,5,"I love my  Toyota FJ Cruiser!! I live in Ohio, so we see snow every year. The FJ is like a tank. It can plow thru snow in 4-wheel drive like it's a dry road. It handles REALLY well in all weather conditions. I've had my FJ since 2011, and I just recently got into an accident with it. My back bumper had a small dent. Her driver's side door no longer closes. I feel so safe driving myself and my kid in it. The only downfall is that it is a bit of a gas guzzler. Thankfully I don't live far from my workplace, so pre-pandemic, I was going thru a tank of gas per week."
4006, a year ago,4,I have had a great experience with my car and with the Toyota service center. It has been way better then any of the other ones I have had in the past. I will buy another one in the future.
4007, a year ago,5,"Only owned it for a few months, but love the space, the ride and how easily it handles! The only thing I think could be improved would be the third row, it’s very small and even uncomfortable for some fully grown adults, leaving it useful only if you have kids/pets that don’t mind sitting back there. Otherwise, put it down and enjoy a very large trunk!"
4008, a year ago,5,Great slick car has been with me 5 years not a single problem  and the dealership is awesome
4009, a year ago,5,"Love it! So much room drives like a beauty. Above all kid friendly, road trip safe and very spacious. I love the functions and color."
4010, a year ago,5,"Very comfortable and reliable.  I particularly love the Sportivo model.  The interior is spacious, perfect for a family.  Good looking and affordable."
4011, a year ago,5,"Looks great, drives smoothly and is very comfortable.  Excellent value for money.  Great family car.  Being a Toyota, it’s extremely reliable and cheap to repair should something go wrong."
4012, a year ago,5,"I love my 2018 Toyota Corolla LE. It drives well, it’s super reliable, and they look way nicer than they used to! I only wish I had invested in more “bells and whistles” because I plan on keeping this car for a long time. Really fair on the price for what you get."
4013, a year ago,5,Buena camioneta versátil lujosa medió costosa en la gasolina  en todo  en general espaciosa
4014, a year ago,5,En general un buen carro sedan cómodo confortable económico de partes mecánicas gasolina etc
4015, a year ago,2,Nada cómoda para pasajeros solo  para los conductores fea y totalmente un carro rustico
4016, a year ago,5,"es un.carro con.un diseño deportivo y lujoso, es super amplio a lo largo y un poco en los asientos pero si son muy ergonómicos, si quieres proyectar una imagen sofisticada lo recomiendo. si es caro pero vale la pena porque por si diseño exterior no pasa de moda"
4017, a year ago,3,My daughter previously had a Toyota 4Runner. The quality of Toyota was certainly apparent but I didn’t think it provided the smoothest ride. They are pricier than other Toyota models but provide a very sporty look.
4018,a year ago,5,Sonho sonho sonho de ter um desse amo de mais queria muito pra levar minha família pra passear queria muito muito mesmo
4019, a year ago,4,The Toyota Matrix is a nice car. It’s really comfortable and fun to drive. The trunk is a reasonable size for daily life. It does feel a little small on longer trips though. I’d still recommend it.
4020, a year ago,5,"I love this car, it drive wonderfully and comes at a great price. I’ve owned many models of the Yaris."
4021, a year ago,5,I’ve owned a couple cars and Toyota Highlander has been my absolute favorite. It’s stylish and is flexible with my kids.

Muy comodo y buen sonido en el estereo."
4023, a year ago,5,I’ve had my car for a year and love it! Speeds up well and haven’t had any problems.
4024, a year ago,4,I have test drove this vehicle a lot and actually am very impressed. i will definitely be purchasing one in the future. the only reason i do give this 4 stars is because when it does come time to purchase it seems like there are minor manufacturer issues.
4025,a year ago,5,The Toyota Matrix is a cute little car that packs a surprising amount of power in the engine. It is a great car for zipping around the city and commuting. It is affordable and has a modern interior that looks fantastic. I personally love how their dashboards look.
4026, a year ago,4,This is a great car that will last you forever because Toyota engines are fantastic. I absolutely love Toyotas in this is a great pic for anyone however I prefer Lexus so the ES series is what I have. Either one is a great vehicle.￼
4027, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Toyota sequoia and although it’s older and completely paid for I don’t really like the newer models body style so I keep this because it’s great for taking family from out of town around because of the three rows of seats and I use it for business and the beach. I don’t feel bad at all about getting it dirty because it’s older. I know this car will last me as long as I want to keep it because it’s a sturdy Toyota engine.￼
4028, a year ago,4,My friend has a 2016 Dark grey Toyota Corolla. It's smooth! I liked being passenger. I just didn't like the black plastic seats as they were really hot on a Summer Day. They're pretty affordable and long-lasting! 
4029, a year ago,5,"I love my Rav4. I had never had an SUV, until I got this and I think it is great. Sometimes, I have felt that I am too small in it, however with the awesome seat lever on the side, I can easily boost myself up so I can be comfortable behind the wheel. "
4030, a year ago,1,It's a good car for someone who doesn't need much room and is either just starting out driving or just wants something low maintenance. I personally wouldn't purchase a Toyota branded vehicle but thats just a personal preference. Riding passenger in this is comfortable and its fun to take for road trips.
4031,a year ago,1,"No tengo ese coche pero parece buen modelo enserio 
Se de gente amigos y familiares que lo tienen y dicen que le van muy bien 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
Yo lo recomiendo"
4032, a year ago,3,Es muy lindo el Camry aparte de cómoda les encantará creo el color que me gusta es el plateado
4033, a year ago,5,"This Toyota model left nothing to be desired, it is super comfortable and efficient.  everything you would expect from a Japanese car.  The gas mileage is spectacular, at the end of the month when you take the gallon count by gallon consumed compared to other vehicles of the same type.  the speed development on the freeways is spectacular, it is a very reliable vehicle"
4034, a year ago,3,Muy linda y cómoda para guardar el súper o para salir de paseo con la familia me gusta
4035,a year ago,5,My Camry has pretty decent gas mileage. It’s very comfortable and very reasonably priced.
4036, a year ago,4,"Very smooth ride, in terms of feel on the road. Compared to Honda, this car is sturdier but Honda has more bells and whistle ‘s. Gas mileage is really good on this car too. I’m not crazy about the design on the outside of the car but the interior is very clean.￼"
4037, a year ago,5,"This car is great in all aspects! It’s price is great and it uses very little gas￼, it has a very smooth drive. Also it is very safe for new drivers!"

4039, a year ago,5,Very good product. I would highly recommend this to friends or family. If you are thinking about trying it you won't be disappointed when you do
4040, a year ago,5,My first car was a Toyota Celica Supra. It was a five speed. This car was awesome. It took a little bit to learn how to drive without stalling out but I got it. These cars are very sporty and very fast. They also get very great gas mileage. All in all this car has a very smooth ride.
4041, a year ago,3,A great tank of a car. Feel very safe but also a massive gas guzzler. Outdated for this modern era
4042, a year ago,5,"For the few days I drove it, it was fun and easy to drive! I felt very safe and it was easy to feel comfortable after just a few minutes behind the wheel."
4043, a year ago,5,"I love this car too much, it is super beautiful, comfortable, pleasant, easy to drive and easy to park. It is the perfect size and works for an outing with friends to dance or even go around the city! I recommend it 100% for people who love to go out and enjoy a good trip!"
4044, a year ago,5,"I LOVE! that small size is super comfortable, especially when it is for a single person, since it is not spacious. But for a single person or with a partner it is really perfect"
4045, a year ago,5,"This truck is beautiful, it produces greatness when you use it, and it is super tall, something very comfortable to drive."
4046, a year ago,5,"I recommend to each person with the availability of having it, it is really comfortable.I love cars with this big and elegant design, it looks incredibly beautiful in all colors! also, it is a toyota brand, the best of all!"
4047, a year ago,5,"I recommend to each person with the availability of having it, it is really comfortableThis car is really beautiful, I have seen it in different colors and I love it. In addition, it is from one of the best car brands that exists. Siempre luce elegante"
4048, a year ago,4,We have the limited high lander and it’s amazing. As super reliable family friendly vehicle to ensure we are safe in the roads.
4049, a year ago,5,Love the safety features. Great quality vehicle. It feels luxury without the luxury price tag
4050, a year ago,4,Cheap car all around to manage and upkeep. The transmission is known to not last over 10 yrs. it is a good car prior to ten years owning.
4051, a year ago,4,"For me, the best car ever, economic and still affordable, very stable and reliable. Not changing this brand."
4052, a year ago,2,Not my favorite car. Poor acceleration which makes sense considering the engine size and bad blind spots
4053, a year ago,4,This car got very good gas mileage (28-32) but it was a very noisy car. Very loud while driving
4054, a year ago,5,"Love this ca. Very reliable and affordable, will last you for years if kept up well."
4055,a year ago,5,"We actually have a Scion xB. Love my car, pretty good on gas mileage and haven’t had too many major issues. Only minor maintenance issues. Unfortunately they stopped producing them."
4056, a year ago,5,"The Rav4 is a very comfortable car that you can fit just about anything into. It is a great car if you have kid(s). It drives smooth and its MPG is pretty good, especially when you take other SUVs into consideration. It is a sporty yet elegant looking car."
4057, a year ago,5,"The Camry is slightly larger than the Corolla, but is still a car that will save tremendously on gas. It is very roomy. I have never personally owned it but have a lot of friends that do and they are happy with this car. It is definitely a classic."
4058, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Corolla is a very reliable car. It is great at saving gas and is very compact, easily fitting into those tight parking spots; however, it is also comfortable and roomy! This is a car that, when taken well care of, will last for many years."
4059, a year ago,5,"My husband has a 4Runner and we love it! I wish the miles per gallon were better but understandable because it’s such a big (can be) an off road vehicle. I think they are a little expensive, but you get what you pay for!"
4060,a year ago,5,This car is very comfortable to ride in. You don’t feel the toad very much and it’s very good on mileage.
4061, a year ago,5,I love my camry. She’s white with a black interior and super cute. It’s comfortable to drive and gets great mileage. I’ve had it for over a year now. This is the first car I bought on my own and I was excited how affordable it  is :)
4062, a year ago,4,"Es un excelente automóvil, en verdad se los recomiendo si están pensando en comprar un carro nuevo. El motor es de los mejores y los repuestos son fáciles de conseguir en una agencia, además viene en colores lindos."
4063, a year ago,4,A lot of space and easy to haul things in or hook a trailer to. It is a big wide but I like the features and rolling down the back glass can be handy. A good family car for people who still like to do things and haul things
4064, a year ago,4,Very functional second to the CHR. The rav4 has more space to haul more things. The roof in the back isn’t as sloped. I prefer the drivability of the CHR more and the look over rav 4. Other than that it’s a good family car
4065, a year ago,5,Loving the body on the new Camry so sporty and luxe. I just wish the inside paneling wasn’t so plastic and that the media system wasn’t that black iridescent plastic that catches every piece of dust and fingerprint.
4066, a year ago,5,"I love it's a cool car easy to use and very safe the color I love it other than that it's very comfortable, It's easy to clean plus it has multiple seats"
4067, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota 4Runner. It is very reliable and has a great 4x4 system. It does not get the best gas mileage, but it is a 4x4 SUV. I love how smooth the ride is for a 4x4. I got mine used, so it was very affordable, more so than the Tacoma. I love my Toyota and would recommend to everyone."
4068, a year ago,5,"Comfortable ride, masks the bumps in the road well. With proper maintenance lasts a long time."
4069, a year ago,5,"Love it. If you maintain it, lasts a long time. Good 4wd for snow. Convenient back hatch opening."
4070, a year ago,5,"As a busy mom with three kids, this minivan was a natural choice. Plenty of room and a great safety rating. We shopped around and got a great deal on a used one. I would absolutely recommend this vehicle to anyone!"
4071, a year ago,5,"Great car for anyone, the seats are super comfortable which is great for people like me with back problems."
4072, a year ago,4,"Love our 4 runner but the back seat is pretty tight. With 2 carseats, no one else fits. The 3rd row is also really cramped and leaves no trunk space at all if it’s up. The car runs great though and we haven’t had a single issue with it."
4073, a year ago,5,"We purchased our Camry from my in laws who purchased it brand new. It has been an amazing car for our family. I have three kids, twin boys.... so I needed a car to fit the twins car seat plus an older child in between. This car works great, plus the trunk is huge! I dont know much about the engine and spec inormation haha, but I can say with proper maintenance, we havent had any major issues going on 8 years now.  Toyota Camry"
4074, a year ago,5,Toyota makes very nice looking cars that are up to date with the new current technology. They are very easy to repair if there is an issue and very affordable. This is a perfect first car for new drivers and also a perfect car for longtime drivers. I love my Toyota !
4075, a year ago,5,"I love this car, it’s so cute and a great price. I get a new car every couple of years and so far my past two have been the new corollas because they look so good and drive really well. They also last long and the price to upkeep these is much lower then with a BMW !!"
4076, a year ago,5,"Great mid size SUV! Rugged but doesn’t drive like a truck. Interior width was too narrow for three car seats. But before all the kids, this was an amazing vehicle for us"
4077, a year ago,5,"If you are looking for a reliable SUV, great on gas this is a great choice for you! Comfortable and a smooth ride!"
4078, a year ago,5,Nice size up from a corolla if you are looking for more room but still a car that is trustworthy and great on gas!
4079, a year ago,4,Nice car! Great on gas! If you do not neee a lot of room i reccomend! If you are very tall or if there is a bulky tall man this would not work.
4080, a year ago,5,"I have had my corolla since I began driving at the age of 15 (I am now 27) honestly it got me through high school, it got me through university and now as I start my career it is still with me. I will drive that car until it can longer move. We are at 314 000 km's (canadian) which is equivalent to 190,000 miles. I have NEVER had an issue with that car before. It is GREAT on gas. I will be crushed the day she no longer goes."
4081,a year ago,5,the Corolla is a good compact car. It earns great fuel economy estimates and has a terrific predicted reliability rating. It also has lots of standard driver assistance features and an easy-to-use infotainment system
4082, a year ago,5,My husband and I loved this car. Reliable. Comfortable to drive. Great on gas mileage and surprisingly roomy inside. Loved that it had a sporty edge to it in its looks also
4083, a year ago,3,The Toyota Camry is probably at the bottom of my Toyota list. Camrys are the worst and also are known to have some of the worst drivers. Just stay away.
4084, a year ago,5,I love a good Toyota for some reason and Highlanders are at the top of my Toyota list. I enjoy this car and wouldn’t even consider buying one myself.
4085, a year ago,5,This is the type of car my dad has. I enjoy driving this car. The features are nice as well. I would recommend this car as someone’s first car.
4086,a year ago,5,"It’s a very comfortable car and Is super spacious. I love that it also doesn’t use gas until you are passed a certain speed. The back is spacious as well, making it good for small road trips. Definitely recommend it."
4087, a year ago,5,Love it my 3rd one!!!! No more Hybrids though...battery goes dead if not driven enough! Bad with this Covid! Went back to gas model! Have a XLE Premium now!
4088, a year ago,5,My car is a 2002 Toyota Camry and it’s still running strong! I’ll drive it till it won’t drive anymore. :) I recommend Toyota’s for longevity!
4089, a year ago,5,Eu não tenho nada pra fazer um canal no YouTube por isso ganho essa coisa para testa e eu tenho fé de mas Maravilha de produto adorei tchau quando chega fala com tu não irá se arrepender adorei tchau quando chega fala com tu não irá se arrepender
4090, a year ago,5,"I have the 2020 Camry SE and I absolutely love it! It's great on gas, it has a radar feature for cruise control so if the car in front of you slows down you automatically slow down as well. The fact that it's got 5 star safety ratings across the board is awesome as well"
4091, a year ago,4,"Es cómoda, tiene muy buen diseño igual no gastan mucha gasolina , creo que es perfecto para un viaje largo por que vas como y casi nunca tiene problemas de que se descomponga algo"
4092, a year ago,5,I got my 2018 4Runner shortly after my second baby was born. I wanted a safer and bigger option than my small sedan. I had always wanted an SUV and was in love with the 4Runner. I got it in charcoal grey and absolutely love it! It is the perfect anti-minivan mom mobile. I blacked it out and ordered beautiful wheels. I added nerf bars to prevent other cars from door dinging me and it provides my toddlers an easy way to step up into the car on their own. LOVE my 4Runner!!!
4093, a year ago,5,"Incredibly reliable, smooth and easy to drive, with great features. It’s stylish, reliable, and very spacious."
4094, a year ago,5,"I bought the van used from a friend and it’s the best purchase. Over 200,000 miles and still running great. Only issue I have are the struts but gas mileage is great. Definitely worth the money"
4095, a year ago,4,"My Prius is great on gas, but the only problem I have at the moment is that the car stopped recognizing my key so I have to lock it from the inside and I have accidentally locked my key INSIDE the car yet the car didn’t recognize that the key was inside and I had to break into my own car to rescue my remote."
4096,a year ago,4,The Toyota Highlander is a smart car and there’s a lot of things in there to help you prevent having a car accident. A con is it burns gas quickly if you have the A.C on or if you’re speeding. If you have the money than this car is not that expensive.Toyota Highlander
4097, a year ago,4,"Sienna is a sensible choice but it isn't very engaging to drive. Although the Sienna rights comfortably and is quite inside, its handling is lackluster. It has a lively 3.5 litre V6, but the 8-speed automatic doesn't shift very smoothly. However fuel economy is decent 21 mpg overall."
4098, a year ago,4,"I can't drive, just as well 😂My partner drives and loves his car, his pride and joy, takes it to the car wash every week, and cleans inside it every week, I can't leave any mess in the car, or I get my knuckles hit, Its a big roomy car, good if going away for the weekend."
4099, a year ago,5,For me this are the best cara in the world! They can resist and barely get broken. So for a good price you have a car that last longer!
4100, a year ago,3,Not the worst of the Toyotad but definitely more on the expensive side. Unfortunately I would not purchase one again.
4101, a year ago,5,"I've driven/owned around 7 or so vehicles in my life and while Toyota has always been in my top 3 favorites, the camry has definitely been placed as my top favorite. The gas mileage on this thing is unbelievable great and I couldn't ask for a better vehicle. If damage it is incredibly inexpensive to fix compared to many other types."
4102, a year ago,5,"In 2006 my friend drive a 96 Camry!  It was in great condition abs had over 200,000 miles!  Toyota’s last forever!!"
4103, a year ago,5,Toyota’s are safe and affordable!!  My first car was a Corolla and it lasted me fir almost ten years!  It would have lasted longer if I didn’t wreck it!
4104, a year ago,5,miEs un muy buen automóvil me gusta mucho la marca Toyota los asientos son cómodos y es la marca de coches que mis familiares más compran 
4105,a year ago,4,"I really like my car, it’s pretty safe to drive, I feel very comfortable ridding my vehicle, some cons are that something the brakes have to get fixed or the oil change! I totally will recommend it"
4106, a year ago,5,"I have had the 2017 rav4 for three years and LOVE it!!! This car runs smooth at all speeds, has great speakers and is very spacious. I have the XLE trim and love the sunroof. If you are looking for a lease or to buy I recommend this 100%!"
4107, a year ago,5,I think for the size is very spacious. Is a very nice car with great mileage what I don’t like is that the sun hits you hard in this car
4108, a year ago,5,I love my RAV4 is very spacious. Gas mileage is amazing. Very comfortable great value car
4109, a year ago,3,I thought I was going to love the RAV4 but it wasn’t the best car for me. The lane assist was very annoying while I was driving in town.
4110, a year ago,4,I think the acceleration pickup is a little slow but this is the best “lasting” car on the market. My mom owns one and in almost 5-7 years there have been absolutely no issues except a dead battery ONE TIME.
4111, a year ago,5,"This is the car my parents gave me to drive. I love how roomy it is, yet not bulky. It comes in great handy when moving, as it has loads of space (including the undercarriage). It has fold down back seats which help when transporting larger cargo.

Downside: the center back seat isn't full-sized so it can be a tight squeeze.

It lasts a while, but when something goes wrong, it is expensive."
4112, a year ago,5,Only drove the sequoia once. Enjoyed driving it. Highly recommended due to being a very spacious vehicle.
4113, a year ago,5,"It's a 4 wheel drive, has eco drive option, love the bluetooth capability. The rear camera comes in very handy when backing up. 4x4 Handle well  during window."
4114, a year ago,5,"I like Toyota since its known to have great suspension. I super like 4runners. They are great on roads, wide range of visibility and drives comfortably. For me it’s like a heavy duty car with bucket seats. Just a nice SUV to drive."
4115,a year ago,5,I love this car it is the most reliable and I would also recommend it to anyone who likes good quality cars
4116, a year ago,5,It is a great fast car. If it’s electrical it’s even better to save gas. Cons are there should be 5 seats not 4.
4117, a year ago,5,It works great and I don’t have problems with my car. Also it saves gas and only takes 25$ to fill up my tank.
4118,a year ago,5,"The best without a doubt, very comfortable inside and when handling it. 
Highly recommended if you have children.

 Comfortable for the whole family"
4119, a year ago,5,Beautiful car so powerful so fast I really love it car with a high speed and quality in all the level I realllllllllllly love it I highly recommend it
4120, a year ago,5,It’s okay car. It’s pretty comfortable and durable. I think it also doesn’t eat gas much so you can drive a while before you have to fill it up. I think the price is fair. I would recommend!
4121, a year ago,5,A great car in all the levels we have it for 7 years and it works like the first day we bought its car with a high quality i recommend it
4122, a year ago,5,This car is great on gas and great on speed. It also lasts a long time if taken care of
4123, a year ago,5,Great car. Very easy to drive and pretty safe too. They’re definitely roomier than the corolla. I like how easy they are to maintain and the cost is very affordable. I would love to own another one! They’re great!
4124, a year ago,5,I really like toyota carolllas they’re a very solid car. They have a pretty small interior so they’re not great for moving but they last a really long time. I think they’re a pretty mid range price point.
4125, a year ago,5,Absolutely love this car! I learned to drive on one and convinced my mom to purchase one. I love the center console on these cars. I feel like they’re a pretty solid price point. They’re an easy drive and I’d definitely recommend.
4126, a year ago,5,"Great starter car, safe and drives well. These cars last forever and have a pretty good safety rating. They’re affordable as well!"
4127, a year ago,5,I have a 2019 and love it! This my 3rd Toyota I have ever purchased ( 1st 2 were Corollas). Let’s just say I’m hooked for life now!
4128,a year ago,5,"It is a super comfortable car, it has everything you need with many functions, the truth is that I love it"
4129, a year ago,5,The most reliable car in the market will last you forever! Good size and perf for families￼
4130, a year ago,5,Extremely reliable car that I’ve heard nothing but good things about! sleek style and very comfy￼
4131, a year ago,4,Really cool car that has a nice interior but there are a lot of blind spots which makes it hard to drive but other than that I love the style
4132, a year ago,5,"My housemate just bought a 2018 Toyota Corolla, and I’ve never driven or known anyone that drove a Toyota. I took this for a test drive, and was thoroughly impressed! It has a very smooth ride, with quick reacting steering and gas/brakes. It seems like a super solid car, and like it’ll last a good while!"
4133,a year ago,4,"Tres bonne voiture ,facile à  conduire, solide.
Modele très securisant avec des airbags partout.
Un système  audio au top"
4134, a year ago,5,Love this Limited edition. Great safe car drives great great interior and Toyota service is good. Perhaps offer other colors.
4135, a year ago,5,"Definitivamente es mi marca favorita, cuando pueda adquirir un vehículo me encantaría que fuera Toyota. Solamente veo en esta marca pros sin ningún contra. Es costosa pero vale la pena por su desempeño, diseño, comodidad, larga vida y todas las ventajas que trae la marca "
4136, a year ago,3,It is an affordable and fuel efficient vehicle. No frills but reliable. Very affordable good service but ugly interior . I would redo the interior and offer more color options. No we are actively looking for another vehicle.
4137, a year ago,5,"I have a 2013 corolla and I love it. It’s held up really well over the years with no issues! It is reliable. No major bells and whistles, which is fine because it gets me from place to place just fine. I bought it new in 2013 and thought the price was pretty affordable!"
4138,a year ago,5,"excellent reliable, fast and safe car. Confot the smoothest of our vehicles in which I have been a passenger"
4139, a year ago,5,I'm loyal to the Toyota brand. Drives smooth.  Spacious. Handles well on the road. The body of car is very sleek and modern.
4140, a year ago,5,I drove my sister-in-law‘s 2019 Sequoia loved it I like the smooth drive the only thing I didn’t like about it was that it uses a lot of gas other than that I recommended especially if you have a big family and like to travel comfortably. ￼
4141, a year ago,4,I test drove a 2018 forerunner I enjoyed it it drove great it reminded me of the Tacoma truck that we owned in the past. If we have a buy a new vehicle my eye is set on the 4x4 4Runner or 4x4 Highlander￼.
4142, a year ago,4,I only drove it for a few hours as my friend lent it to me to run some errands while my car was in the shop. It felt fun and tough. But I don’t have any more to say about it negative or positive. ￼￼
4143, a year ago,3,It was a 2018 Corolla and it didn’t have the quick response that I thought it would have. We had owned a previous 2008 Corolla and I felt that car had a more pick up and go then this 2017. It was a Lease so when it was over I did and we knew. ￼￼
4144, a year ago,5,I Purchased a 2013 Toyota Camry and I still owe on it to the state August 2020. I love my car the horsepower it Hass. It is only four cylinders sport edition but it has such a great pick up and go when I hit the Excelerator. ￼ my brother has a 2018 Camry and he loves driving my 2013 because he says mine feels more powerful when you accelerate. ￼
4145, a year ago,4,"It is a hybrid car which makes it good for the environment. It costs only $20 every 2 weeks for a full tank. However, its not always a smooth drive. I'm not sure if its just my car in particular."
4146, a year ago,5,One of the most trusted car company here in my country. Corolla is a classic car you can never go wrong
4147, a year ago,5,Muy buen Carro Económico y muy fuerte . Muy cómodo para manejar y muy Espacioso en el maletero . Me Encanta 😃😃
4148, a year ago,5,De lo mejor y más coqueto que hay en el mercado. Ahorrativo y versátil. Lo amo!!! Recomendadisimo a todos
4149, a year ago,4,"The first car I ever drove. Safe, easy to drive and I love that for a bigger car, I don’t notice the blind spots as you normally would with bigger body cars. Love"
4150, a year ago,1,Not my favorite of the Toyota cars. The handling isn’t the best & it doesn’t make me feel extremely safe
4151, a year ago,5,Best car ... alot of space and have all features. Perfect for small family and have a durable car seat lock which i great. This car is the best car for everyone and toyota engine is known for its great performance
4152, a year ago,5,"De las mejores camionetas ! Es rápida, cómoda, permite realizar largos viajes en cualquier superficie junto a toda la familia"
4153, a year ago,5,"I did liked this car for several reasons: very easy to use, durable and comfortable.My major problem was the battery. My husband used to get frustrated with the battery. Other than this I don’t see any other particular reason to dislike it."
4154, a year ago,5,"Best car ever ! Space wise and mileage wise as well, there’s nothing i can’t do in this vehicle and I love it. If I had to make any improvement it would be for rear AC control , but other than that this vehicle is everything i could want in a car !"
4155,a year ago,3,Not good in the winter snow. Good for normal driving on highways and main roads. No 4 wheel drive.
4156, a year ago,4,"good car for a single person or perhaps a high schooler. Good on gas, easy to drive.If you get in a wreck ,its probably going to be pretty much totaled. You can find pretty good deals on used ones. little pricey on the newer years ones . but its a toyota,you can expect that. take care of them and they run forever!"
4157, a year ago,3,"my daughter has this vehicle. i have drove it many times! its ok on gas usage. but small things are always breaking. the rubber seal on back door you open , on the inside of door,half of it just fell and basically is always hanging.some of the knobs inside on dash have broke, cheaply made. It is nice that it has the 3rd row seat, but you sure dont want to be very big, its a tight fit sitting back there!!"
4158, a year ago,4,Great car. Small and easy to park in the city.  Comforts and spacious considering how small it looks on the outside.
4159, a year ago,5,I have a 2005 corolla and it still runs perfectly.  I want it to stop working so I can buy a new car but it just won’t!  Would definitely buy the same car model again!  Awesome quality and great price
4160, a year ago,4,Two sliding doors and the boot closes itself. Rear view camera to check your surrounding when parking. Great for a big or small family’s and it has a removal middle seat so you can get to the back third seat. Trunk space is small I guess so you can have leg room inside.
4161, a year ago,4,"I’m short and whenever I drive this car. I drive like an old lady because it’s so high. And I’m afraid of driving on a real curvy road as for some reason I see the car on its side. If your y’all, great car for you and what I love is the back seat passengers have their own AC setting"
4162, a year ago,3,The car is nice and has a rear view camera. When it comes to Toyota’s I just don’t like the brakes and how loose the steering wheels are. It’s too light in my opinion. They have some fuel efficient ones which is nice and push start!
4163, a year ago,5,"Great gas mileage when I had this car.  Smooth ride and has a little pickup to it!  Trunk was a little small, but it was perfect for what I needed."
4164, a year ago,5,"This van drives like a sedan! Super smooth, tight turning radius, and plenty of room for storage and a big family."
4165, a year ago,5,I love my car and am the original owner. I bought brand new in 2007 and have never had a problem with it ever. I will eventually get a bigger car but for just me and one other person its perfect and all I need. I love that the seats go down in the back to make my trunk extra big too. it can fit all my stuff for the beach or travel.
4166, a year ago,5,"Would absolutely positively buy if able, my friend Lacey had this in highschool and it's was a midnight bluish purple like that changed colors! The lights were the blue and pink ones, the spoiler was so high like I absolutely loved the Celica GT vs wowwww one of the best rides I've ever had the pleasure of driving or riding in."
4167, a year ago,5,"It is a quality vehicle, it is spectacular there is no comparison. It is the best vehicle they have ever invented."
4168, a year ago,5,"My husband has a 2004 with 287,000K miles on it, it still runs great. He drives it back & forth to work since it gets great gas mileage. We love it!"
4169, a year ago,5,Strong durable and low maintenance car. Look cute and small but very comfortable and spacious inside. Best first car ever!!
4170, a year ago,5,"I love the way the new Toyota 4Runner looks. I test drove one before I bought my Rave4. The only problem I had was, it drove like a truck. They are affordable but can be expensive if you get all the bells and whistles. I would recommend this car and this will probably be my next car purchase."
4171, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota RAV4. It’s sporty looking. It’s rides very smooth. I have a one year old and it’s big enough for my family of 3. The RAV4 are very affordable and you can upgrade. I would recommend this car.
4172, a year ago,5,I loved my Toyota Corolla. It was perfect for when I was in collage and it was just me. It was dependable and safe. It drove very smooth. I would recommend this car to others.
4173, a year ago,5,"Lo tengo desde hace 20 años, muy buen coche, nunca ha tenido ninguna avería importante."
4174, a year ago,3,I mean it’s and okay car there is nothing wrong with it but I think personally I just have expensive taste and want a little more in a car than what this particular one offers but I would recommend because a car is a car either way
4175, a year ago,2,"I bought it used from dealership. It only had one previous owner and a clean tittle. I made sure to take it in for maintenance every 3 thousand miles. Out of nowhere it started having engine problems. I’ve taken it to 3 different mechanics and each one tells me something different and quotes the repairs from $2,000 to $3,000. I thought Toyota Corollas were supposed to be reliable and last for a while. Not going to lie, I am pretty upset about this!!"
4176,a year ago,5,Love my prius. It is half electric and half gas. and when i am on gas the mileage is amazing. This car has cut down my gas bills by so so much! 
4177, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my car. I have the 2013 model and it still runs amazingly and is in great condition.   My family loved my car so much that my sister and mom got the same car. My mom has the newest model and it’s great! Great gas mileage, perfect size, and decent price."
4178,a year ago,5,These cars are so nice! They have many different trims available to fit your budget and many different colors to fit your style! They are also pretty luxurious and have a lot of cool features. I would totally buy!
4179, a year ago,5,I have had both a 2016 and a 2020 Toypta Corolla. Both cars have been the best cars I have ever owned. I used to have a ford mustang and Chevy Camaro and both cars had so many problems. These cars last forever and are amazing!
4180, a year ago,5,I’ve always enjoyed Toyota’s. The Camry is very sleek and nice. A great starter car. I get great mileage on gas and find little maintenance for ware and tear.
4181, a year ago,4,"It’s nearly impossible to kill a Toyota. My 2012 Corolla was purchased used in 2013 and still runs like it did years ago. The breaks are squeaky no matter how many times they’re replaced, and the trunk starts to smell on humid days if you don’t air it out a bit. But Toyota always has been a reliable, affordable brand."
4182, a year ago,5,The Toyota is a very reliable car.  The miles go far when you own a Toyota.  I have driven to different states in my car without Any car problems.
4183, a year ago,3,The Corolla is a nice mid-size car. Very spacious compared to other cars in its class. I am not a fan of the body style; it looks unfinished (sorry). I think it is a nice and affordable car for young professionals.
4184, a year ago,5,Camry’s are really nice full-size cars. I handling is nice and smooth. Great visibility throughout the whole car. The price pint is reasonable for a family car.
4185, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my Prius. It is cute. Gas efficient. Has many features that are great for me, such as a push start and locking the car door with the the outside car door handle. Love the way they have the trunk cover! Very convenient to have the cover roll up nicely on its own when not needed, as to save space! Very convenient and well designed!"
4186, a year ago,5,"I really really really love my Tacoma. I love the seat heat, the screen and is nice for traveling, and hang out to the mountains"
4187, a year ago,5,"Muy cómoda, para mi económica y linda. Aunque no puedo comprar una todavía en República Dominicana, son muy cotizadas y carísimas."
4188, a year ago,5,"La verdad era de mi hermano del 1997, pero que caro y lo bueno, los repuestos en mi país (República Dominicana) los consigues donde quiera.
El mío era un Toyota Starler, buenísimo, económico y las piezas igual, se conseguían donde quiera"
4189, a year ago,4,I had a Highlander for years and it treated me amazing! It is a great sized family car and offered me plenty of space along with a a smooth ride. It was great on fuel despite the size and was super easy to get serviced. Highly recommended for families with car seat sized kiddos.
4190, a year ago,5,"Saves money on gas, what more can you ask for in a car. This car is spacious, leather and you forget where then gas station is because you don’t have to constantly keep getting gas. It’s the most recommended car in my opinion."
4191,a year ago,5,Toyota is the best. Comfort has been well innovated. Powersteering wheel very spacious large variety of models and colors very powerful engine. These cars are a lifetime guarantee and on top of that never breaks down in the middle of the road. Very economic on fuel. Highly recommend
4192, a year ago,4,"Hermoso auto, cómodo y seguro. El color azul es precioso, los asientos aseguran comodidad y plenitud. Un auto seguro y rápido"
4193, a year ago,5,"Best medium size sedan you can buy with the best a/c and the best millage per gallon in the city and on the road, comfortable with an elegant design with all modern features available."
4194, a year ago,5,I got this car as a hand-me-down from my aunt and uncle. I had this car for roughly six years and I loved it. It was a good driving SUV. Does well in any weather condition (I live on the northeast coast so I get four season weather). It is super roomy and comfortable as well.
4195, a year ago,4,"For the price I can’t complain. Never had any issues in the 4 years I’ve had it, has pretty good gas mileage and a touch screen console. Very basic but for the price it’s dependable and cute."
4196, a year ago,5,"My favorite car 🚘 in the WORLD, definitely. It was also my first car to drive. So it has a special part of my heart. Improve? It is the best right now"
4197, a year ago,5,Amazing reliable cars I currently drive a 2012 and it’s still running like brand new .
4198, a year ago,5,This ￼ vehicle is so roomy and nice.  It makes a wonderful family vehicle. I would definitely love to have one.
4199, a year ago,5,This review is for a 2001 Toyota Celica . It was bought used from a Toyota dealership in 2003. It was an amazing car and lasted until I sold it in 2016. The body lasted well with minimal rusting. Little work needed to be done over the years. There was a sunroof which did not leak. The vehicle got amazing mileage. The hatchback allowed many large items to be placed in the trunk space especially when the back seats were folded down. My car was dark blue and I loved my baby.
4200, a year ago,4,I had a 2002 Toyota Highlander for 4-5 years. It was a great vehicle. But it was getting to where small things were starting to mess up like the a/c and windows and stuff like that. Which I’m sure that happens to every vehicle.
4201, a year ago,3,My ex had a Toyota but i use to drive it when we was together it wasn't something I would have gotten for my self but its a ok car
4202, a year ago,5,"mi experiencia como pasajera en el auto toyota prius fue super agradable en ningun momento sentí incomodidad a pesar de que es un auto bajo, creería que no es un auto caro, no pregunte en el momento, claramente el trayecto se sintio super suave por ende lo recomiendo"

It also had a full spare tire. Great safety reviews. Highly recommend."
4219, a year ago,5,"I enjoy my Toyota Rav4 and would highly recommend it. I find that it has the right amount of room for my small family as well as room to pack, carry, or travel with items needed.

4233, a year ago,4,"I enjoyed riding in this car; however, I’ve found it less reliable than a Corolla or a Camry. It’s also an SUV, and at times it feels like you’re driving a bus. If you are looking for an SUV, the RAV4 is pretty pricy."
4234, a year ago,5,"Super roomy in the backseat. Great car when you’re starting a family. If you enjoy golfing, the boot can fit several golf bags! It’s pricier than the corolla, but it has a lot of extra perks that corollas don’t."

I’ve had my car for 2 years and it hasn’t shown any problems at all! Just the quarterly oil changes, changing the air filters, tire change and alignment! 

It’s honestly the best car to travel with too! It has plenty of truck space and foot room in the back seats."

4279, a year ago,3,I love the hybrid factor of this car. We were able to drive half way across the country and only filled up a few times. Down side to this car is that its not big people friendly. Its very small on the inside and if 2 big people get in it you feel like you're sitting on each other.
4280, a year ago,5,This is a beautiful luxury car. It has so many fancy features we name it the tesla lite. The car can drive itself in cruise control with little help from you. Its on the affordable high end with bad credit. This car is far better then I expected it to be and would definitely recommend it to others. Decently spacious for a smaller midsized SUV.

While I cannot speak to the numerous improvements that have been made in the years since its debut, I can say that it is a reliable SUV, with plenty of storage room. Although it is an SUV, it drives smoothly and maneuvers easily, making it feel like you're driving a smaller car, while giving you the added visibility of being in a larger vehicle. It's the best of both worlds."

I've saved tons on gas with my Prius and it has been the perfect car during my college years and driving 100+ miles once or twice a month. My 2007 Prius is well over 150k miles and still works great. Very little problems that were an easy fix. Low maintenance call overall. I just got a new car but my Prius will forever be my first love!! "

(Unlike other models) It’s been an amazing car to me and only wish I could have gotten a few more upgrades at the time but I was in college then and couldn’t afford the nicer features that are extra. I also choose this car because it has been rated as one of the safest. I’m hoping this car will last me another 5 years before I upgrade to bigger and better things but I’ll definitely keep choosing corolla.
4335, a year ago,3,"I mean it’s my parents car, it’s nice. It takes them to point a to point b. I don’t think there has been many issues with it. I mean it’s a car haha I’m not good with car stuff. So don’t look at me when it comes to questions like how’s the gas? Because I will tell you that I have no idea."
4336, a year ago,5,"Best SUV imo, smooth comfortable ride with updated base features. Handles very well. Model year 2014 could use a better navigation system that is easier to read while driving."
4337, a year ago,4,Can’t go wrong with a Toyota. With consistent maintenance this brand can last well over 200k miles.
4338, a year ago,5,"A very nice, modern car. The Camry is well made has great gas mileage and looks very sporty. I would improve it buy someone creating a model with more back seat space for kids. Yes I would recommend this car."
4339, a year ago,5,Best car ever. We had a 1988 Camry. It finally died. I always rent them when I travel. Any model is great. The trunk space is huge. Never underestimate!
4340, a year ago,4,"Great running car!  Wasn't terribly comfortable on long trips, but I had an older model.  I believe the newer models probably ride much better!  I would definitely look at this if I were in the market! "
4341, a year ago,5,"I love this car, it has low fuel consumption, it looks small but inside is bigger, it’s a nice car to run errands, take the children to school. I RECOMMENDED!"
4342, a year ago,4,"I like this car, it get a nice look when you tuning, I have owned this car for almost two years and I haven’t motor problems, the price is a little high, I would prefer a most beautiful and comfy interior, but it’s nice! I RECOMMENDED!"
4343, a year ago,5,Did a test drive on this vehicle was impressed with the woman is inside extremely comfortable however I feel as if it was a little overpriced
4344, a year ago,5,"Its a great car, comfortable don’t make to much noise and i like driving it it is smooth."
4345, a year ago,4,Very smooth ride. Somewhat simple dashboard. Some very nice features. Not the greatest on gas mileage. Very comfortable and enjoyable for driving vacations.
4346, a year ago,5,Luxurious and spacious. Has good mileage and reselling price is also good. Comfort level is too good.
4347, a year ago,5,"It is such an amazing car, it looks so pretty, like a dream, the seats are so soft and comfy, when you drive it feels nothing but your pulse is so good to go in the road, I recommend you this if you have a big fam and want to go on adventures."
4348, a year ago,5,"Solid commuter car. It gets decent mileage. It’s been extremely reliable and we’ve had very few maintenance costs. The car just hasn’t had issues even though it’s driven 5-7 days per week. We live in California so we do a lot of driving. It’s tempting to trade up to a new shiny model but it’s hard to convince ourselves to when this car still looks similar to when we drove it off the lot, it hasn’t had issues and we’ve paid it off. 11 years and still doing great!"
4349, a year ago,5,I have a very old model so my review won’t be very up to date. This car lasts a very long time
4350, a year ago,5,This is such a mainstream car for a reason. Was great to learn how to drive in and was a safe small car for when I was in high school. Highly recommend as it barely uses gas and runs extremely reliably. I pumped mine out and he looked so sleek.
4351, a year ago,4,"Love my Toyota, have never had a problem with her. She is reliable and doesn’t use up too much gas. I have the 2018 model so it doesn’t have the airplay screen, but with that it would literally be the perfect car."
4352, a year ago,5,I love my Yaris hatchback! It is the perfect little car! Great for driving around the city and fuel efficient! I love how easy it is to maneuver and it easily fits into any parking space. My car is over 10 years old and it is still running perfectly.
4353, a year ago,4,I wish the interior was nicer but otherwise it’s a great car for someone who likes to travel by car and has tons of room
4354, a year ago,2,"Too many blind spots, don’t like the way they handle. Just personally not my favourite car."
4355, a year ago,4,"My father owned one when I was younger. So, I can say it was good for families. We were a family of 5 and we sat comfortably."
4356, a year ago,4,A good everyday car. Nice and spacious. Good for families. My mother owned one the majority of my life up until I was 14 and then we moved out of state.
4357, a year ago,5,Best car in life and Toyota service I recommend 100% where I live you're able to get a manicure.
4358, a year ago,5,I like the look of the 4Runner. I feel they are a classic ￼￼ sleek looking vehicle. Plenty of room.
4359, a year ago,5,Good on gas. drives smooth on the road this car also offers a good amount of space so best believe no ones kneeing you in your back lol .
4360, a year ago,5,"It’s very good on gas and good with space, I love it and I think I’m going to move on to the more expensive one"
4361, a year ago,5,I love my new 2020 Toyota Corolla SE🥰🥰🥰🥰 it's the firstbcarbive owned on my own and it's great. The mileage is great the interior is very luxurious and it's incredibly reliable.
4362, a year ago,5,The best vehicle ever. My absolute favorite vehicle ever. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4363, a year ago,5,This is my dream car! I have always wanted one when o was younger and I finally was able to buy one. The downside is that the center screen doesn’t work anymore but other than that it works like a charm! 10/10 best car I have ever owned Toyota Prius
4364, a year ago,4,I LOVED my corolla! It has all the features I wanted without having to pay extra. It gets great gas mileage and is a very durable and reliable car. The only downside is it does not have the best acceleration which is expected in an economy vehicle. This car will last you for years and years! It’s also great for a first time driver because it’s safe and compact!
4365, a year ago,4,The Camry is a very reliable car and has so much room! The interior is like a boat! 5 people can sit very comfortably in the Camry! What I love about Toyota is a lot of features come standard so you don’t have to pay more for a back up camera etc! It has a pretty smooth ride and is a great family car. It is also very safe and reliable. I gave 4 stars because it’s not an ideal sedan for one person.
4366, a year ago,5,Wow it’s an amazona car . I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’ll never change this car . Comfortable !
4367, a year ago,5,My ex-husband on this car he owned a 1979 it actually ran forever he loved it it was the most reliable car great gas mileage easy to fix and seriously it ran forever and we had it for many many years it was one of his favorites
4368, a year ago,5,"There are absolutely no words to say hiw much i love out Toyota Rav4 2015 LE. Spacious car with ample of room for storage in trunk. For additional storage u can fold seats 70/30 depending on space u need. Fuel efficient, great mileage car. Comfort and smooth ride for long travels. Sports mode is fantastic in this model.  Toyota RAV4 has been by far my fav. I'll keep this one until i can n hope to by newer models in future."
4369, a year ago,4,"This car is great because you are alerted if you’re crossing over into another lane, but the dash screen is so small and seems outdated."
4370, a year ago,5,This car is so reliable and I’ve had it for years. I love it and it never seems to have a problem. Runs forever
4371, a year ago,5,"I love so much my Rav4, is big inside, comfortable, i feel really safe when i drive my SUV, is good for singles or big familys. For a road trip or beach."
4372, a year ago,4,We were in a grab car and this was the car it looked cute but its small for my brother who is tall and while me it's okay. But in our country toyota parts are expensive so for me its a good brand but i think its not that worth it
4373, a year ago,4,I Love this car! It’s very roomy an good on gas mileage. I gave it 4 stars because the only thing I would change is for there to be air vents near the backseat. My son gets very hot in this Georgia heat and the front vents don’t do much for him.
4374,a year ago,5,I used to own a 4Runner and it was an excellent SUV. It was both luxurious and sporty. My favorite thing about it was that the  window in the back of the car was automatic and rolled all the way down. This is ideal when traveling with a large dog.
4375, a year ago,4,"This is my current car, I got it 4 months ago. It looks very sleek and classy on the outside. I’m not a car person but I like this one as it looks more modern. The seats get uncomfortable fast on long road trips. I love how it has eco mode which I use daily! It is pretty roomy for a car."
4376, a year ago,4,"Bumpy ride, since it’s a SUV. Not great gas mileage. Holds up well for age of automobile, but of course it’s a Toyota, so it will. Older ones are affordable, new ones are expensive. Would recommend the automobile."
4377, a year ago,4,"There are some things I would change about the Camry. The ECO on it bogs the car down, during take off. The remote starter, you have to pay more per month for it. The stereo system sucks in the car, for the amount you pay for it. It’s like Toyota didn’t even ask the customers what they wanted, just built what they wanted."
4378, a year ago,5,"This is one of the nicer sedans that Toyota has. A little bit larger than a corolla with more luxury features. A reliable, comfortable vehicle that will last a long time."
4379, a year ago,3,It looks nice but I hate the front of the car I feel like I can’t see the hood of the car completely. I also hate the headrest they are very awkward and not comfortable at all.  The car is very low so you can mess up the front or the sides really easy if you’re not careful. Everything else is okay.
4380, a year ago,4,My first car was a Toyota Corolla. It was a bit old and beat up but it was a great starter car as I didn't have to freak out about minor scratches either. I would definitely like to try one of the newer versions of this car
4381, a year ago,5,"My parents had this car for forever. The longevity of Toyota cars still surprises me. The drive is decent and although I've only been in older versions of this car, the interior is basic and has the necessary necessities"
4382,a year ago,5,Great car. I have had this car for a while and it is really nice. I save a lot of money on gas and it rarely ever breaks down. I would recommend this car to anyone especially new drivers or college students.
4383, a year ago,4,"Solid, relatable, dependable, efficient. What is there to say. Toyota gets the job done. You can count on your car when you need it."
4384, a year ago,5,"I have a 2014 Toyota Corolla S and I will be driving this for another 10+ years! I don’t feel the itch to buy a new car at all. I have absolutely 0 regrets on purchasing this car.
I’ve never had any issues except for recalls which were replaced for free. Just changed my tires at 52k miles and that’s been my only maintenance besides routine oil changes. I’ve done a few drives from Seattle to Texas and it a been great!!!"
4385, a year ago,3,We love the way ours drives. It is much bigger inside than it works from the outside. Perfect for a family. I just wish mine had a third row so i could fit all three of my kids.
4386, a year ago,5,"My friend drives this car and I like their newer one, but I’m not a fan of camry for some reason. They look really nice inside and out, but not my style."
4387,a year ago,4,I think the RAV4 is great. It’s spacious and is a nice car! My one problem with it is that it doesn’t drive the smoothest. It’s quite bumpy and can be a bit uncomfortable.
4388,a year ago,5,It’s a really good car with plenty of space and good for the mudd I really love this care make
4389,a year ago,5,"This is what people call, ""the daily car"". The Corollas that been in my family and friends had been great. I can't go into detail because the year of the car matters to be able to about safety and all..."
4390, a year ago,5,"The best car in the world I got mine 10 years ago I am in love of my car it is my first car .... you can put everything you need in the trunk (big one), the back seats are just for while you need your mother in law at the back sit so it is perfect hahaha is confortable beautiful, fast and I made 1.000.000 km with my car without any damage on the engine so you can tell...."
4391, a year ago,5,"I love my car! I will continue to buy Toyotas for as long as I live. They are fun, comfortable rides. PROS: Best in gas. CONS: No get up and go. I like a little zip in my cars and there is none here. It's reasonably priced. I would so recommend this car to anyone."
4392, a year ago,5,"Nice small car and good for first time drivers. Great on gas and sleek design with added touches like back up cam, sun roof for an affordable price."
4393, a year ago,5,"I love my toyota camry! Its such an iconic car and it's a nice drive. It is a bit noisy in the compared to other higher end cars, but I am fine with it since I know this car will last me for years and repairs aren't gonna cost my a arm"
4394, a year ago,5,"Excellent vehicle. If you change your oil every three months and balance your tires and keep up with your maintenance, you really shouldn’t incur any problems. Toyota’s are great vehicles with a history of longevity."
4395, a year ago,5,"I have a 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport 4x4. It is one of the best vehicles I've owned.  It doesn't come without its flaws though.  The stock gear set 3.91:1 is utterly garbage.  It needs at least a 4.88:1 gear ratio to fully be able to operate properly.  It does, however, have an immense amount of stock power. Toyota are built solid and made to last. Ive recommended them to my family members as well.  Toyota Motor Company"
4396, a year ago,5,"I bought this car in 2007 at a steal. Till this day it’s still going strong and hasn’t broken down once. This car is great for someone trying to save money on gas or just wants to save money in general. The Yaris is also great for moving. The seats go all the way down so perfect for putting large bulky items in the car. This car overall has been really comfortable, low maintenance, and extremely reliable. I would definitely recommend this car for someone who doesn’t like to change things up often."
4397, a year ago,5,Just bought a second gen Sequoia . It has the 4.7 in it . Love it .lots of power and tow . I like the fact that it can go up to 300k easy and get your money worth out of it. I really recommend it for the long run .
4398, a year ago,5,"Great reliable car. Great gas mileage and cheap parts . Tires aren’t expensive either .
Improvement I would say maybe make it AWD . It is affordable and the loaded is in the 30s . I would definitely recommend it"
4399, a year ago,5,"I loved my Camry, I felt safe, it had great features and was comfortable. Pros- it was great on gas, spacious, and user friendly. I bought mine used but it was still in great condition. I would recommend it to anyone looking. Definitely looking to buy again when the time comes. Just not big enough for the towing capabilities I needed"
4400, a year ago,5,This car is so beautiful. I’ve always wanted one! My sister in law and cousin had one. They drive like a dream.
4401, a year ago,5,"I love it. It’s a great car. I want from a Honda Accord to this. I love that you sit higher, it has more room. I love that it came with a back up camera. My dog loves it. I would highly recommend. I would purchase a Toyota again for sure."
4402, a year ago,3,It’s extremely noisy lots of rattles and wind noise. Ride is ok. Interior is very nice. Poor gas mileage compared to 2017 version. Cost is average. Was hoping to get the Telluride but it’s very hard to get right now.
4403, a year ago,5,I absolutely adore my mini van! It has been so useful for our little family even without kiddos yet. Our model is from 2004 and I inherited it from my parents. It is still running strong and has made multiple drives across the country without having any issues.
4404, a year ago,5,Besides my BMW this is my favorite vehicle of all times!! The cabin felt like it was designed just for me. We had the diamond plate interior. The only negative was the suicide door. I had 3 teens and it was a pain getting them in and out.
4405, a year ago,5,"My Toyota Camry has it all! Air conditioning, back-up camera, spacious, and it has style as it features some leather accents. Overall, it is a great affordable car. I have not had any problems with it and I’ve had it for over 3 years now, all i do is maintenance and I’m good to go. I highly recommend getting a Toyota Camry!"
4406, a year ago,5,"This is my favorite car I have ever driven! When my voltswagon goes out, this will definatly be my next car. These things drive amazing, they are fast and they last forever."
4407, a year ago,5,"En mi país de origen Toyota es una marca muy respetada. Nos ha brindado durante generaciones vehículos de calidad, que se adaptan a las condiciones climaticas y de los suelos, no requieren reparaciones frecuentes por sus buenas autopartes, con confortables, fieles, buena velocidad, equipo stereo, AC entre muchas otras ventajas. Sus lineas son elegantes, quien adquiere un toyota desea casarse con esta marca para siempre!!"
4408,a year ago,4,"La Toyota yaris hybride est un bon compromis pour ceux qui veulent s'essayer à l'électrique mais qui n'ont pas encore sauté le pas. Elle est maniable, silencieuse et assez petite. Idéale pour faire de la ville et surtout pour se garer. Il faut juste s'habituer à la boîte de vitesses automatique. Personnellement ça ne m'a posé aucun problème."
4409, a year ago,5,"I love my RAV4. I have had two of them. They last so long. Currently drive the RAV4 Hybrid and it is a great car, never any problems, but the gas mileage is not that good for a hybrid car. It is around 30mpg. I still love it and would buy it again, but wish I knew going into it so I wouldn’t be disappointed."
4410, a year ago,4,"Good mileage (sometimes around 50 mpg), good car overall, does not seem to stay nice as long as other Toyotas but can still last a long time. Good value for the money, but don’t keep their value well. Buy it used!!"
4411, a year ago,4,"We own two Toyota Corollas. My husband picked these vehicles. I don’t care to drive them. To me, they aren’t comfortable cars. They are easy to park and get decent gas mileage. We haven’t had to do a lot of repairs. I don’t feel like they have a lot of room, especially as my two kids are getting bigger."
4412, a year ago,5,"I have an 11 year old Toyota Highlander and it is my favorite car of all the vehicles I have owned. It has comfortable seats and enough room for our family. I like that I can see since it stirs up higher on the road. I like that I have third row seating when needed, but can put the seats down to put groceries in. We’ve taken multiple trips in it. I would be so sad if something happened to my car."
4413, a year ago,5,This car gives a smooth ride. It has a nice interior. A lot of room for backseat passengers. It is very economical and a little gas goes a long way. A great car if well taken car of last a long time.
4414, a year ago,5,Toyota is an excellent brand and the RAV4 model isn’t a exception. Inside is too comfortable and have several accessories for your convenience. Little expensive but worth it. Fully recommended
4415, a year ago,5,"I am IN LOVE with this vehicle. I can’t wait to own one, it’s sporty, not too big, not too small. It’s luxurious but not in a fancy way, it has all the gadgets I like and it can be used for an outdoorsy car. Perfect car"
4416, a year ago,4,"My best friend has a 4Runner, it’s a great car with a lot of room!! Great quality and very durable. The only thing I don’t like is sitting in the back because I easily get car sick in this car for some reason, maybe it’s all the extra space in the car. Otherwise GREAT CAR"
4417, a year ago,5,"We love our Rav4. We’ll probably get another one when it’s time.  We live in a city, and we like that it’s not that big to make it impossible to park on the street, but roomy enough for us and carrying items.  Love the way it drives as well."
4418, a year ago,4,"My car gets great gas mileage. It’s a 2004 so it’s older, and isn’t the best looking car but it gets me where I need to go and has never given me a single problem. My family has owned Toyota’s for as long as I can remember and have always loved them."
4419,a year ago,5,"I don’t think anything more needs to be said about how reliable, sturdy and fuel-efficient Toyotas are. I’d buy mine again, it’s a really nice color and very cheap to maintain. If you’re looking for a good first car look no further."
4420, a year ago,5,Gets me where I need to be . Want something bigger....... but this will do for now drive safe
4421, a year ago,5,Loving my new rav4! Truly a comfort vehicle! The sound system is perfect and never grainy at all! This car fits everyone I need it to and I can easily spend a whole day shopping and fit it all!
4422, a year ago,5,"These cars last forever, they drive good, drive pretty well on sand when camping! A lot of space on the inside"
4423, a year ago,5,Great small crossover. Have third row so you can pack it full of kids! It is on the smaller side but is always dependable and since it’s a Toyota it will last forever!
4424,a year ago,4,I bought to be frugal because I don’t have a lot of expenditure right now.  It’s worked great! But there is a problem on the electrical portion of it that a lot of people have expressed on the same model I have that I had not been recalled so it would be super expensive to fix.  I don’t appreciate that at all.
4425, a year ago,5,"Toyota is a very good brand that it would last you forever, efficient car, and very well done, I would like them to be more luxurious inside, but overall is a good hod that you can have for generations."
4426, a year ago,5,"Is the perfect car for the every day, is the perfect for drive it daily, is very economic, is ergonomic, it's comfortable, it looks nice, is the best car for a busy person, is the best car at all"

4428, a year ago,5,Me encanta mi carro. Fue un regalo de cumpleaños. Realmente el Corolla es uno de los mejores carros que eh tenido
4429, a year ago,5,We love the 4runner. The style and comfort of this vehicle is unmatched. We enjoy taking our 4Runner off-road.
4430, a year ago,5,"I love my car with all of me , I got my car in a horrible time but without getting it I would have lost both of my jobs and been out of more money then I could afford to not have . I recommend Toyota to anybody needing reliable transportation"
4431,a year ago,5,Such a deceptively large vehicle. Lots of space for literally anything you can think of while maintaining a reasonable fuel efficiency. Very classy looking car in my opinion. Great for anyone with lots to carry!
4432,a year ago,4,Always drove this car on long car trips with the family of four. Plenty of space for everyone to be comfortable while still having room for a dog and all the luggage! Definitely a must have if you have a busy family with lots of extracurriculars
4433,a year ago,5,"Great reliable car when you keep good care of it. My used 2007 corolla has about 80,000 miles on it and still as reliable as ever. They're great for a first car to last for years (I got mine in high school, plan to have it well after college). Only issue with this year is that the tire caps seem to pop off, though that's an easy buy and replace off of amazon if it bothers you that much. I love my corolla! I even plan to get a newer model once my time with this one is up."
4434, a year ago,5,This car is super comfortable! It’s perfect for a family of four! Its got a lot of space and it is very welcoming! It’s perfect for long-distance drives!
4435,a year ago,5,"In love with all things Toyota but this has been my favorite car to date. The maintenance is low, and It’s been a very dependable car."
4436, a year ago,3,"I loved my Prius, I really did.... but the gas mileage wasn’t as great, it could have had a better technology interface to use and it’s not a comfortable car for commuting."
4437, a year ago,4,Very nice inside and outside. More expensive than competitors. This car drives well and has good handling
4438, a year ago,5,I love my rav4 so much. It gets great gas mileage and is very reliable. I have never had any issues with this vehicle. There is a lot of room in the truck and back seats. This car is my favorite
4439, a year ago,5,"My sister in law owns one of these is great it doesn’t matter if she’s a good keeper or not, this car is good for traveling"
4440, a year ago,5,It is a very nice car ride very smooth and gets great gas mileage. Haven’t been to many problems with this car.
4441, a year ago,5,Can’t go wrong with Camry. Had one even older edition and each year it only gets better
4442, a year ago,5,Cute little car and super comfortable. Both my mom and sister own one and they love it
4443, a year ago,5,Amazing classic car. Will but it for my sister when she turns 16. Definitely a great first car but also for experienced drivers
4444, a year ago,5,The most beautiful amazing car ever. Saves on gas and helps the environment. Definitely will leo it for years and years! I’m in love with my little pancho
4445, a year ago,5,We’ve owed 3 Prius’s and I do t think we will ever go back!  Never had one single issue with any of them. The gas mileage is fabulous.  I get gas about once a month!  It surprisingly hauls a lot of stuff!!  Love the Prius!
4446, a year ago,4,"A very nice compact/small car that maintains a great amount of space in the interior. With 32 miles per gallon, you’re able to get great mileage while saving money on gas and frequent fill ups. This is a great first car, starter family car, new purchase, etc."
4447, a year ago,5,The 1999 Toyota Lite Ace we still have was pass down by my grandfather. This is the one I learned how driving. Manual Transmission and not power steering. Learning from the basic is so amazing and deiving automatic transmission is definitely a breeze!
4448, a year ago,5,"Very nice, spacious and easy to maintain. My husband took real good care of our ride. It is nice, clean and comfortable. We added some accessories for even fun drive."
4449, a year ago,5,Love love my 4 runner i purchased a 2020 and well I’d never go back after this purchase
4450, a year ago,4,"My boyfriend has a black Scion TC and although it looked fancy, it was very low and I always ended up hitting my head on the door frame. Not fun, but I miss this car had amazing memories driving in his car!"
4451, a year ago,5,I love my little Toyota! Honestly it’s not the prettiest color but it has never failed me (knock on wood)! It’s very reliable and definitely has efficient!
4452, a year ago,5,"After totaling my first 4Runner, that I had had for over 8 years, I purchased a new one. This is the best car that is so reliable."
4453, a year ago,5,"Best car I have had. Only #3, first 2 were also Toyota’s. This is perfect for a young family or a single girl like myself who wants extra space for passengers or be able to take home that unnecessarily large furniture piece you bought on a whim at TJ max. I had to make a purchase quickly but my next car will be another RAV4 with a more updated package"
4454, a year ago,5,Affordable family car. Great gas mileage for a 4 door SUV. Toyota holds value and life of vehicle is awesome. Rarely have any issues and the vehicle will run forever!
4455, a year ago,5,"These. Cars. Never. Quit. I love RAV4s and have heard incredible things from all drivers who own them. There is little improvement to make, and this is a car you will have forever. Definitely recommend."
4456, a year ago,5,"These are incredible cars! So much room and the gas mileage is INSANE. There is room to spare and the visibility is fantastic. Especially for a preowned vehicle, it is very affordable and a great car for all drivers."
4457, a year ago,4,I like this car a lot. It’s quite big for an suv yet still compact. The mileage is great

4467,a year ago,5,THE perfect sized SUV to own if you want the in between sizes of a bigger car than a sedan but a smaller sized car than a regular big SUV. Easy to drive and can be parked in a compact car spot.
4468, a year ago,5,"Toyota Corolla é décima segunda geração do sedan médio da montadora, que é produzido no Brasil para ser distribuído aqui e em outros países da América Latina desde 1998 e já superou a marca de um milhão de automóveis fabricados."
4469, a year ago,5,AMAZING. It is sporty enough for my tastes but big enough to have my kids in the back. It’ll fit 3 car seats across. Has a huge truck that fits a lot of groceries.
4470, a year ago,5,"I have had my Toyota Yaris for about ten years and it has 300 000 km on it. With all that wear on it, I haven’t spent more than $5000 on it in the whole time I’ve had it. It’s mileage is great and I would not hesitate to buy another Toyota when this one finally dies."
4471, a year ago,4,"Love my rav 4! It’s small and compact suv and easy to maneuver but it’s also large enough to fit 5 plus has space in the trunk. It has the alert in the mirrors so when your switching lanes, you can see if someone is in your blind spot. Has a lot of cup holders and storage spots. I do wish the trunk was bigger!"
4472, a year ago,5,"Had my Toyota Camry for 10 years and I loved it. It was a quiet ride, and reasonably priced on gas. This is my second Toyota in my lifetime￼!Love these 🚘 #Influenster"
4473, a year ago,4,I have the 2019. I LOVE. This vehicle. It’s so comfy and such a smooth ride. It has so many extras that I feel like I’m so fancy. My only dislike is it doesn’t have the digital speed and I wish it was just a bit bigger.

4477, a year ago,5,"Great car, and great on gas. Oh and can’t go wrong with the price value! And just to fix them is pretty cheap."
4478, a year ago,5,"My husband’s first “grown up” car he purchased. I’ve had several Camrys and can attest to Toyotas’ good value. We love the Prius; the hatchback makes it easy for us to cart our bikes to the beach or our dogs on a road trip. One word of caution to home mechanics, though: be prepared to learn something new or take it in to be professionally serviced."
4479, a year ago,5,"My first car when I turned 16 was a gold Camry. I drove it for several years, and when it was time for a new car, can you guess what I bought? Another Camry. Dependable and affordable, we are now nearing the 200,000 mile mark, and while she still has plenty of life left, I know it will be time for me to start looking soon, and I’m seriously considering... you guessed it, a Camry."
4480, a year ago,5,"I owned a Corolla for 4 years and then passed it on to my daughter.  I liked the mileage I got with it, 33mpg, and that it gave me a sense of being safe.  The back seat is not as ample as the Camry but three people still fit comfortably but not roomy.  Leg space is not too much for the front if you are 6' or more."
4481, a year ago,5,"This is a very comfortable car, has space on the front and back seats.  You can fit 3 or 4 people in the back, 3 very comfortable and 4 a bit tight but to me is the limousine of the sedans.  I have been in other cars that even though they should allow 3 people in the back seat, you feel very crowded."
4482, a year ago,5,"This car is fuel efficient, low maintenance, safe and dependable. Any toyota vehicle is more reliable by nature and the repairs are less strenuous to your wallet."
4483, a year ago,5,I’ve had my Corolla for over 10 years and I love it so much I never want to get rid of it!! I have a little over 120K miles and have had few problems with the car itself over the years. There have been a couple recalls but Toyota always takes care of that. The only real complaint I have is that my white paint has started chipping but upon calling Toyota they repainted it for me under warranty! ￼￼
4484, a year ago,5,"Toyota is well known for being one of the most dependable and long-lasting vehicles on the road. The RAV4 is no exception. In fact, reliability is built into the RAV4's DNA. Toyota's reputation for reliability is just one of the reasons the RAV4 is the best-selling compact SUV in its class."
4485, a year ago,5,I love my Toyota Corolla! It’s a 2006 and I’ve had almost no problems with it. It drives great and has great mileage

4490,a year ago,5,"I love my friend’s Camry. She has the sporty one and it is beautiful! It is very fast, has beautiful trim and the specs on it are nice. I would like to get the hybrid version for mkyself as my next purchase. The backseat is roomy even for being a somewhat smaller car. "
4491,a year ago,5,"I love the gas mileage, it is roomy for a small car. I have the 2010 so this model burns oil somewhat badly but it still runs like a dream. A lot of Toyota models burn oil so it is not a discouraging factor for me, although I may buy a hybrid Camry next! "

4494, a year ago,4,"I loved how smooth this drive was. It had an effective display and great space in the back for passengers. I gave it 4 stars for the overall size/space provided-I wish the trunk had more space. This is a great car, no doubt."
4495, a year ago,5,"It is very comfortable, since it is very wide, also when traveling on the road you do not hear noise and the car does not heat up"
4496,a year ago,5,My first car I ever owned and payed in full on my own. It definitely made me feel like an independent adult. Toyota is such a reliable and long lasting car if you properly care for it. I had a 2011 Toyota Camary SE until I was hit by another car and my car got totaled :(. In the 6 years I had my car not once did I have an issue with it at all. The price is definitely worth the quality. Toyota Camry

4498, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota Camry!! One of the most reliable cars you can drive, it isn’t fast if you’re looking for speed."
4499,a year ago,4,"I hate the back window, I hate how expensive it is to fix (it's my parents main car) but I love how long it has lasted.  It's close to the road so snow season (remember when we use to have that) is a little hard. But wow their car does save them money and again it has lasted a long time."
4500, a year ago,5,I love how smoothly my Camry drives. Turning the steering wheel is as smooth as butter and it is so quiet. It fits 5 people comfortably and has a spacious trunk. The sunroof is an added bonus. The only thing missing from my Camry is an auxiliary port.
4501, a year ago,5,Toyota Corolla will def be my next car when I am ready to purchase. I absolutely love how great it is with mileage and the built of the car!
4502, a year ago,5,"I love the Toyota Camry, any Toyota’s are good. My old car has over 300K miles before I bought a new one. Camry’s run smooth and the 2019-2020 camry is rated one of the top cheap car. It’s a good car and I really like it. I definitely recommend anyone to buy it especially for the price."
4503, a year ago,5,I love my new Toyota Camry se. It's in all black and it's a used car. I got it for $12.000 straight. The inside is leather and cloth and it has a virtual touch screen for listening to music. It may have a few scratches but it's the second car I've ever had and I love it.
4504, a year ago,5,I’ve recently gotten the 2019 rav 4 and all I can say is that I’m obsessed. It is very roomy and comfortable. The rav 4 has a very sleek look as well.
4505, a year ago,5,"I’ve always been a Toyota person, and when it was time to buy a new car, I knew I had to get the Corolla. Has good fuel efficiency and I know it will last a long time. The seats and controls are also comfortable and accessible."
4506, a year ago,5,"Супер экономичная и компактная машина, нужная машина для долгих поездок, легкая в управлении, самая первая моя машина была😍"
4507, a year ago,4,This is a cute and economical car. You get so much mileage out of it. This would be even better if Toyota came out with a suv hybrid! The price stays good if you trade it in the Toyota dealership other dealerships will devalue it.
4508, a year ago,5,También es una buena marca pero es más costosa que la que poseo en este momento (Nissan) y tiene menos tecnología aunque a la larga dicen que es más durable
4509,a year ago,3,This car is a massive beast. I like that I can fit my bike in it without having to take off a wheel.

4511,a year ago,4,"It’s fine, but I’m rating this as a passenger. I can’t really give much information about this car other than that."
4512,a year ago,3,"It’s fine, but I’m rating this as a passenger. I can’t really give much information about this car other than that.  I think this car is overpriced. The third row had no legroom, and when it’s up, there’s minimal trunk space."

4517, a year ago,3,My mom gave me this car so I can’t complain ! It was my second car and it has barely given me any problems ! It’s just very basic and affordable where as I like expensive and luxurious. I recommend for singles not a very good family car because it’s very small.

4522, a year ago,3,"This is the car that my mom has and I’ve driven it a lot. It gets pretty good gas mileage and it’s comfortable. It’s got some blinds pots and it drives like a bigger car than it is, but it’s reliable and safe and very roomy inside."
4523, a year ago,2,"It’s a Corolla. It’ll get you were you want to go, but you won’t be getting there very stylishly. It’s reliable and responsive enough that it’s easy to drive. But it’s a Corolla. There’s nothing special."
4524, a year ago,4,"My sister has this car. She purchased a 2008 pre owned 5+ years ago and has had some maintenance issues with it, but she also works it pretty hard and they’re usually fairly minor. Despite this, it’s still overall pretty reliable. It’s very comfortable inside and great for moving, as she often gets roped into helping because of the size."
4525, a year ago,5,La Toyota es una excelente camioneta a mí me encanta las camionetas pero es de un cuidado este estilo de camioneta ya que es un carro con un excelente estilo y muy valiosa
4526, a year ago,5,"I love my 4Runner! I have driven a Toyota since I first got my drivers license. They last forever and need very little maintenance.

4594, a year ago,4,"Very nice car. My mom drove one for several years. It’s a good, reliable car to drove and I always felt safe in it. The only thing was that the touch screen became uncalibrated after a while and was hard - if not impossible to use."
4595, a year ago,4,"I haven’t personally owned one of these cars but I have driven one and my aunt has had one for several years. It’s a great car to drive. The new ones are SICK and come in some awesome colors that you don’t see every day. However, I have heard that they go through tires fast."
4596,a year ago,5,Great and comfortable car. We are 5 and we love it. Toyota is a great brand because it doesn’t waste any gas.
4597, a year ago,5,I love my little party Prius! Fuel efficient and incredibly roomy!! Have had a few issues and repairs but parts are not expensive and my husband has fixed most everything himself. 10$ gives her gas for miles!!!
4598, a year ago,5,"Classic ride. Strong structure, very safe and reliable. Love the interior, and the style is timeless."
4599, a year ago,5,Anyway to come economic car that has comfortable space and amazing colors is a way to not spend a lot of gasoline
4600, a year ago,5,It's a nice car you will see that they have a lot of parts economix and you will have them the best car  there
4601, a year ago,5,This is a great car all around smooth ride very comfortable and has great gas mileage for an SUV there’s so much space and it looks great!￼
4602, a year ago,5,This was my first car and it was the most amazing time of my life! It’s a gorgeous style and dependable though the blind spots in the back windows are horrible!￼
4603, a year ago,5,"I own a 2009 Scion tC and I absolutely love this car!!  It is a 5 speed, manual transmission and so far out of 11 years, I have only had trouble with my clutch once.  This car has great features including the pioneer cd player and the glass section in the roof of the car over the back seat area.  The hatch/trunk area is spacious.  I hate that this model has been discontinued.  The only bad part of this car that I have found is the 3rd break light on the hatch seems to be defective and I believe that it no longer works because of the weight of the hatch being open and shut many times over the years."
4604, a year ago,4,"This is the second Toyota Camry that I've purchased brand new.  I drive a 2019 Camry SE.  My old 2017 Camry LE had a cd player, which was a standard feature for a basic radio.  My 2019 SE, does not have a cd player which is a totally bummer.  I do like more engine power in the 2019 vs the 2017.  Also I like body style better and the phone charging kits that come with the car.  The engine sometimes seem to have a delay when slowing down and going back back into acceleration.  I do recommend the 2019 Toyota Camry SE."
4605, a year ago,4,I borrowed my brother-in-law’s car one day and I loved this vehicle so much fun so much space and I really loved the utility features of this vehicle. I loved that when we got it dirty we could take the seats out and just hose it out it was so convenient for anyone that lives in active lifestyle.
4606, a year ago,5,We love this car so much. It comes with all the options and it’s pretty roomy for a midsize car. The price is pretty good and the details they put into this car are impeccable. I would recommend this to anyone looking for safety affordability and reliability.
4607, a year ago,5,This car has been an amazing car. So much luxury in one car. It is really big and roomy and comfort so many family members you never feel cramped. We also love the amenities that it comes with such as the DVD player and a nice plush leather seats. Such a good car
4608, a year ago,5,"Of all the cars I’ve owned ( which is 7 lol) this car has held up and needed little to know issues. The only thing I’ve ever needed is oil changes. It’s lasted me 5 years and although I did a 72 month finance- and an upside down, I still recommend this car. It’s great from parents and has tons of safety features!!"
4609, a year ago,4,Lovely vehicle! Very spacious for large families but a bit pricey for basic mode in comparison to other brands
4610, a year ago,5,This is one of my favorite SUVs. It is a mid range price wise but worth the price. It looks so cool and is super roomie.
4611,a year ago,5,"La mejor marca de vehículo! Las piezas son económicas, los modelos son hermosos. El único punto negativo que veo ahora es que muchos carros nuevos ahora tienen un motor que dice Mazda. No entiendo porque el cambio. También he notado que los autos corollas del 2000 al 2009 fueron los mejores que salieron al mercado y los más duraderos."
4612, a year ago,5,"I am currently leasing a Toyota RAV4 which was my adult dream car haha it’s everything I wanted. Spacious, with the perks I wanted. I got a model with a sunroof which was a must-have for me. It was nice looking have options when it came to my RAV4. I also love the floor mats! They’re rubber and plastic so when it’s time to clean them you can just take them out and wipe/spray them down. Great for beach trips as well because the sand virtually comes right out once you shake the floor mats out! My gas mileage is AMAZING. Especially for an SUV. Highly suggest!"
4613, a year ago,4,I LOVE THIS VEHICLE. By far the best vehicle Toyota has made. I love all of them from the 90s all the way to this years brand new ones. All around great vehicle.
4614, a year ago,5,This is amazing quiet car that is chargeable! I love charging it and saving on gas! It runs both on gas and electricity and your buck goes a long way

4616, a year ago,5,Lovely car! It is perfect for families and great for moving and has lots of space! Also good on gas
4617, a year ago,5,"My family had to match Camry's for years. I really miss mine now. It was comfortable, safe. I had all the important features and everything was laid out logically. Safety is very important and I had a good feel for the car and great visibility. "
4618, a year ago,4,"Pretty good, my car would do this thing where It didn’t fully shut off sometimes, but the gas mileage was great"
4619, a year ago,5,"Super reliable car and awesome on gas! Purchased brand new at 2015 and when i bought my dream car, i passed it down to my brother and it’s still going strong. Hasn’t broken down once. As long as you do the regular maintenance, you have a reliable car for well into the future"
4620, a year ago,4,"I love love love my car, I have a few complaints about the get up and go, it seems that I have to have the car in sport mode (as opposed to normal or eco mode) for it to respond to command like a normal car would which can be annoying"
4621, a year ago,5,"Love my trusty old RAV 4! I’ve had it for quite a while and it’s a reliable, versatile, and comfortable vehicle. No issues whatsoever"
4622, a year ago,5,"Good on gas, great car for a small family.  Also a great car for a new driver.  Lots of leg room and trunk space"
4623, a year ago,5,"I was a Jeep girl until i purchased a 2016 Grand Cherokee and it wasn’t at all what I wanted. I switched to Toyota due to loving the look of the 2018 4Runner Limited. The safety specs are phenomenal, which was a plus for me as a new mom. The comfort of the vehicle is phenomenal - lots of features and the car rides so smooth. I am definitely a Toyota girl now!!"
4624, a year ago,5,"I’ve always had suvs ever since I had a car but I needed a car since my new used car broke down 6 months after I got it and I didn’t have much money as a down payment so I settled for a Toyota Corolla. This wasn’t my first choice since I have two large dogs I wanted the extra space for but once I got the feel of the car and got my dogs into the car I fell in love. This car is very high tech and spacious! Toyota has this safety package on all their vehicles. Which has lane assist, brake assist, apple car play, smart cruise control and ai sign reader. The dealer I was working with said the car can basically drive itself. The lane assist beeps when you cross over a line in the road and will gently move the car back into the lane. The brake assist will brake for you within 2 feet of an object if you don’t get to the brake fast enough but it will cancel out if you press the brake. This is helpful if someone cuts you off in traffic or something runs out in front of you and you aren’t quick enough to the brake! Saved my car a few times! The smart cruise control has a setting you can change to one, two, or three car Lengths you set the cruise control speed and the car will adjust accordingly so you won’t have to keep braking and resetting it if a car goes in front of you. The ai sign reader will grab the signs on the road and display them on your dashboard. It’s mostly the speed limit signs but it’s still helpful in case you missed the speed limit sign in an area you aren’t familiar with. The car is also equipped with Amazon Alexa in case you don’t have an iPhone. Someone hit my car not paying attention in a parking lot and smashed the front side fender. The corolla shattered the panel she hit but didn’t shift anything under the hood or the hood itself. My aunt was saying it’s kinda like how race cars are built. If they are hit they only shatter in that one spot instead of damaging the whole vehicle. The air bags didn’t deploy during the accident but I read the manual and saw how many airbag were in this car and was amazed at how many there were. You are in a giant bubble if you are ever hit and the air bags deploy. You have the normal dash board airbags, the side curtain airbags, and a center console airbag. The one concern I had with the car before buying it was the space I was losing out on from downsizing to a sedan. Yes, I lost space but it’s still spacious enough to fit a few weeks of groceries in the trunk and my dogs in the back seat comfortably. My boyfriend is 5’10” and not a thin guy and when he sits in the back seat he doesn’t feel smashed in. In conclusion I would definitely recommend this car to anyone in the market for one. I’m not disappointed at all."
4625, a year ago,5,This car is the one you consider apart of the family. It’s a type of car that won’t let you down and is always reliable. This is the car you pass down from generation to generation.
4626, a year ago,4,The Camry’s are reliable and safe. I have been passenger to many drives and the car overall is great.
4627, a year ago,4,"Mes parents possède cette voiture mais moi non car je n'ai pas de permis. Ce que j'ai à dire sur la marque Toyota ses que ces une marque fiable, résistent et robuste, même en cas d'accident elle tiens le choc . En plus cette gamme hybride et donc elle ne consomme pas de trop, plus qu'une électrique mais moins qu'une voiture normale et en plus elle dure plus longtemps "
4628, a year ago,5,"By far the best vehicle I’ve ever had and definitely the most reliable. I have almost 309,000 miles and still driving so strong. I have a 1998 and I’m so in love with it. They really do hold their value."

4632, a year ago,5,"It is a spacious, comfortable, automatic truck is mine!  I barely have 7 months to have it, and I am happy to have decided on it."
4633, a year ago,5,"Toyota are the best cars in town. My 2003 corolla is at 160,000 miles and still runs great! She is the best commuter car! I love how reliable and safe she is! Highly recommend!"
4634,a year ago,4,"Great vehicle and very dependable to run for a looooong time, way longer than I’ll ever keep a vehicle. Biggest cons are the price and the lack of power. Oh and the gas mileage isn’t the best either."
4635, a year ago,5,I love my 2012 Camry! It has been amazing and reliable for the last 8 years and is still running strong. Highly recommend for its durability and affordability.

4638, a year ago,4,"Best value for money, incredible interior features and super great gas milage. Overall I think there are definitely better cars on the market but I love it and it drives smoothly"
4639, a year ago,4,I owned a 2005 Prius for YEARS!! That thing held on to the very end. In the end the hybrid battery ended up needing replaced which was pricey so I opted for a new car. I love the gas mileage in the Prius and the features were good even for an 05.
4640, a year ago,5,"I had a Toyota Matrix for 10 years and never had any issues with it. I ended up trading it in when it got over 200,000 miles but it was a great car! Toyota is a great brand!"
4641, a year ago,5,"The Toyota Camry is a very nice car. The way it drives is easy on the road. The interior is unique, and it is great on gas. It’s an affordable car."
4642, a year ago,4,"This car is really good and last forever, price is good and there's a lot of space inside, but when I drive over bumps it shakes a lot ! So they could improve that."
4643, a year ago,5,I have an older Toyota 2006 with 220000 miles on it. I have had to fix minimal things and spent money on just normal maintenance over the years.
4644, a year ago,5,Rides well. Extremely roomy. To have a Toyota is to have a vehicle forever. They are truly built to last. My mom currently drives a Toyota.
4645, a year ago,5,"My fiancé had this car and it was his absolute favorite vehicle. Great on gas, beautiful litter speeder."
4646,a year ago,3,The Toyota Corolla is a good car that gets me from point A to Z and maintenance is inexpensive. But I find the car not to be sturdy when driving  Toyota Corolla
4647, a year ago,5,I’m obsessed with this car. It was my first car and I’ve had it for 5 years now and it has never let me down. I’ve never had any issues with it.
4648, a year ago,5,"I owned my 2001 black sport addition for 11 years from 61,000miles until 294,000 miles before someone came in my lane and caused me to flip upside down into a gully full of water. The truck is built so well I alway said it helped save me. It was comfortable, drove sturdy and tight because of the sport suspension, and all I ever did was routine maintenance, change U-joints yearly, and fix a cracked valve cover gasket.  I highly recommend. I would buy it again in a heartbeat."
4649, a year ago,5,This will be my next purchase. I currently own a 16 Altima and in the market now for another vehicle. I test drove the Camry SE and fell in love! The drive the comfort and dependability.
4650, a year ago,3,Mine was a lemon it would constantly break down and was just a plain headache I had an 04. It was nice because it was so roomy but v8 love drinking gas and that it did.

I purchased a 2015 Corolla LE Premium and it has everything I could want in a car. It has heated seats, moonroof, push start, and all leather interior and it drives amazingly. The backup camera is super handy for city parking and I have been very happy with my car so far!"
4656, a year ago,5,"Great on gas. I had a Corolla previously before I bought my SUV & I must say, they’re definitely worth the price as they will las you a long time as long as you take care of it and do your maintenance."
4657, a year ago,5,10/10 would recommend a toyota corolla. I had one as my first car and so did my best friend. They are great on gas mileage and just enough space to fit everyone and everything. It is easy to keep clean and just all around a good and dependable car to own.

4659, a year ago,5,"I had this car as a hand me down from my grandma. It was literally 20 years old- had 250,000 miles on it and it was the best car I’ve ever had. I’m planning on getting another one soon. I miss this car it was the best"
4660, a year ago,4,A great and easy to use and understand car. I like that it sits up high and the blind spots are limited. The price is fair and Toyota’s last forever. I plan on going back to a Toyota soon!

4665, a year ago,3,"Overall a great car. Rides very comfortably. The navigation could use an upgrade, and unless you pay for the highest package, it does not offer many luxuries. I would say that it is too expensive for what you are actually getting."
4666, a year ago,5,"This is my second car, I love how I feel a little up like I’m in a big suv but it’s small and Zippy. It’s a v8 so it has great pick me up and another good investment car. I highly recommend, if you upgrade the towing package you can even pull an rv."

The Toyota Highlander is a good midsize SUV, but it's stuck in a class of great ones"
4669, a year ago,4,"Kind of cheap in gas, kind of comfortable. It is just a good car overall. It is not as impressive as the Camry, or suitable as the Prius, but it is still a great option."
4670, a year ago,5,"Even though it is expensive on gas, it is a very comfortable car and a good one if you have a family. It is also good with space, for example, when you go on a trip, you don’t have to worry about it, everything will fit."
4671, a year ago,5,"Ii have had it for around two months and I have to say that it is a really good car. It is very cheap on gas, and so comfortable that I don’t mind if I have to drive all day. I love it!!!"
4672, a year ago,4,This SUV is really nice. It’s seems to run great and be reliable. I was a passenger in the car so I only know how it was for the time I was in it. I like that it has the 3 row in the back. It’s small but nice for that extra person
4673, a year ago,4,"It’s a nice car. Rides great. I was a passenger , it was spacious. It’s a good mid size car."
4674, a year ago,5,My boyfriend owns this car and it is so great! If you want that sporty look and want to mod your car this is a good car to do that with. The only thing is that inside it is very tiny and it has a back seat but really no one can really fit back there. But the car is great! Gas is good as well!
4675, a year ago,4,They last forever. My mom has had her 2004 Toyota for about 15 years & it still runs very well. Toyotas will last you forever. The paint starts wearing down a LOT after like 10 years like the paint chipped almost completely off the hood but you can get that redone. Also the airbags didn't go off when we got in an accident once but you can get that fixed at a Toyota dealership I think.
4676, a year ago,3,Es muy economico muy ajustable par ti super comodidad lo mejor para tu seguridad ala hora de manejar es muy liviano ala hora de correrlo es super para andar y llevar atu familia de viaje
4677, a year ago,4,"I love my RAV4! Mine is a 2015, and I wish it had a power gate, but I can live with that. It also didn’t come with auto-start. But it’s in the garage all the time, so not much of a factor there, either. Plenty of get up and go. I’ve never had a single problem with it. Best SUV I’ve owned."
4678, a year ago,5,It is very cheap gasoline I like xk the tires twist a lot when you are going to turn and it is very fast as soon as you step on the accelerator
4679, a year ago,5,"I love my 2020 Corolla Hatchback. My favorite features are the heated seats, cleanable upholstery, and integrated Apple car play. The display screen is a great size and intuitive. The backup camera is so helpful and the image is high quality and easy to see."

4687, a year ago,5,I love a 4 runner. It’s roomy. I use it to bring stuff home from the LOWES or Home Depot stores. My 4Runner can seat 7 people. The payment is high but worth it to have a dependable car to drive.
4688, a year ago,5,I have so many friends with corollas! They are amazing cars! Cheap on gas and literally last forever. Only time spent in the garage is for tire and oil changes. You cannot go wrong with a corolla.
4689, a year ago,1,I learned it drive in this and I hate how quiet it is. It drives nice but you could say I have a grudge
4690, a year ago,3,"This is a fun, but slow car. The rear wheel drive on this car is great for low speed drifting."
4691, a year ago,3,It is stylish for its generation. But it is not fast at all. It is fun to drive manual.
4692, a year ago,4,"Pros, Very reliable and comfortable with great gas mileage. Cons, It is not that fast."
4693,a year ago,5,This is our family car since 2012. We love it and it’s taking us on many family trips. It’s safe and reliable. We would definitely buy a new one when this one retires.  It has enough room for all 5 of us.

4697, a year ago,3,"I don’t love this care. My parents had it and it seems a bit flimsy compared to other brands. It used to compete on price, but now it tends to be a pricier car. I don’t think this brand has evolved with its customer base"
4698, a year ago,5,"Es un carro muy lindo, su color es llamativo y brillante, su forma es muy elegante, se ve muy agradable y cómodo,"
4699, a year ago,4,Es un carro muy lindo ademas tiene buena cantidad de espacio haciendo que puedan transportarsen varias personas o un gran equipaje
4700, a year ago,5,"My husband is a mail carrier that had to use his own vehicle. He uses a rav. It’s super spacious and has a great 4 wheel drive. It’s amazing on gas and can go up nearly any terrain. He delivers up mountains and gravel hills a lot. It was a great price as well. Since gettin his, several carriers have switched over as well."
4701, a year ago,5,"Incredible gas mileage. Super quiet. Felt like driving a golf cart. Easy to maneuver, park, drive etc...Not a sexy or fast vehicle. Ha!"

4705,a year ago,5,"Es un súper carro, súper macho.... Es muy resistente muy rendidor, aguanta las rutas largar y pesadas. Es de manejo fácil, es cómoda. Es muy importante ya que lo utilizo para movilizarme para el trabajo y voy tranquila cómoda. Lo recomendaría a ojos cerrados.

4709, a year ago,2,"I have a 1998 Toyota Camry with 170,000. I just bought it. The guy said he rebuilt the transmission and the engine but I’ve had so many problems with it.  Kyle be because it was wrecked so bad or maybe because I have horrible luck. Either way being 22 years old I guess I can say it’s a good car."
4710, a year ago,4,I used it for a very short time but I must say that it was satisfying and comfortable to use its style and design are definitely unique.😎😎 🚗🚗
4711, a year ago,5,"I have a 2010, 108,000 miles...she rides like a beast. We use our sequoia when we travel long distance and the kids are always comfortable. I have own my truck for 4 years.. and love it."
4712, a year ago,4,Improved smooth drive with good power. Front seating not very comfortable even with adjustments. Cup holders awkward angles. Dash gadgets located nicely. Good value for price
4713, a year ago,5,"Never did I think it’d be driving a mini-Van but here I am! And all I can say is, I LOVE IT! Perfect size car for a family of 6, especially when all 4 of my kids are still in car seats. I like that I don’t have to worry about the kids hitting other cars with the doors since they slide. It drives nice and it give me all the storage room that I need!"
4714, a year ago,5,"For a medium size vehicle, it’s good on gas. Reliable! I don’t like it quite as much as the Honda CR-V, but that’s mostly just personal preference."
4715, a year ago,5,"So great on gas! Big enough for all my friends! It’s a large vehicle, so it can be a challenge to park? But it’s safe and reliable!"
4716, a year ago,5,Best first purchase I could have ever made. The SE edition is everything I need in a car. It looks sporty on the outside as well as the inside. The rims fit the car. The upgraded navigation system was definitely a bonus touch.
4717, a year ago,5,My all time favorite car I’ve ever owned. Lasted forever and very durable. Would recommend.
4718,a year ago,5,"muy buen motor me encanto totalemente. super recomendado, como se consigue productos gratis? alguien me explica por favor
"
4719, a year ago,5,My parents actually are purchasing this one very soon.  If you need a kid friendly vehicle without the look and feel of a mini van this is it. I would say their is more on the expensive side but still recommend.
4720,a year ago,5,"Muy buen auto, espacioso, no gasta mucha gasolina, es muy raro el robo se auto partes, los accesorios son muy buenos, asientos cómodos, puedes encontrar desde el básico hasta el más equipado y es perfecto para conducir por varias horas, recomiendo mucho esta marca de auto"

4722,a year ago,5,My daughter had this car.  It lasted forever.  Good quality product.  No cons only good review.
4723, a year ago,4,Toyota’s are very reliable cars. Last a very long time. Older ones are good on gas and last a lifetime. newest ones do the same but are also pretty
4724, a year ago,5,"Amazing vehicle, lots of storage space and built like a tank. I tow a trailer with ease and with 4wheel drive engaged it handles winter conditions very well. Although pricey this vehicle holds its value and will drive forever"
4725,a year ago,5,It was great when my kids were small and I was transporting alot of kids. Great to take on vacation as it holds so much and seats are removable. Very good pickup on the highway. Too big now that we are empty nesters but would buy again when we have grandchildren!
4726,a year ago,5,Great small@sized car with affordable price. Good gas milage and pickup on the highway. Great commuter car but not enough room if you are packing kids for college or transporting supplies for home projects
4727,a year ago,5,I love the upgrades that come with the camry. It has a-lot of power and gets great gas mileage. I do not like the gps or Toyota e-tunes. I would rather have apple carplay. The gps and music screens do not work in hot weather. Needs time to cool down before it will turn on if above 90. Frustrating if you depend on gps which I do for homecare
4728, a year ago,5,"Solid, dependable car with all the new amenities of newer cars on the market today. Good on gas."
4729, a year ago,5,"Almost 240,000 miles and 11 years and still going. Easy to maintain and gets you where you need to go."

4731,a year ago,4,"The car is nice and very comfortable, but the reason why I am giving it a 4 star is because I personally don't like the brakes. I have to press on the brakes harder than other cars I have driven and I have had a few issues with my camry."
4732, a year ago,5,La verdad es un espectacular en tema de trabajo mi padre trabaja con este vehículo y la capacidad si es buena tiene que hacerse los mantenimiento como cualquier auto pero en capacidad si nos quedamos satisfechos
4733, a year ago,5,It was a beautiful and quiet ride. It was comfortable to ride in and had a clean polished feel.
4734, a year ago,5,This is one of my favorite cars ever because it is so comfortable and the design is so simple and beautiful. I love that it doesn’t use too much gas and it is also a very affordable car. This is one of the cars I’m thinking of getting next year
4735, a year ago,5,I love my Prius. We get fantastic mileage in and out of the city and that makes a huge impact on my wallet and on the environment. We have never had any issues with maintenance and I’ve had it for years now.
4736, a year ago,5,Rides well and is very affordable. The interior and exterior are on par with more expensive cars.
4737, a year ago,5,Tengo 1 año con mi carrito. Y me encanta su funcionalidad. Es economico. Espacioso y funciona al cien. Manejo todos los dias y no me gasta nada de gas. No es caro en cuestion de mantenimiento. Y siempre sera mi carrito preferido

4742,a year ago,4,Es muy lindo cómodo y ofrece una comodidad y buen equipo de sonido entre otras cosas recomiendo su compra no se arrepentirán
4743, a year ago,5,"I drove my 2000 Rav 4 for 19 years, and so wish that I could buy it back. It climbed up mountains of ice and snow when I parked . It started no matter the outside temp. I wish that I hadn't sold it."
4744, a year ago,4,Good basic car. Generally lasts a long time and able to use to 100k plus of mileage. Could use bigger trunk space.
4745, a year ago,4,Superb car with high mileage truly in love with it's new features.......its price is quietly high...but almost everyone is gonna love it..my family felt very comfortable in there ...it has lot of space  in it....one of the best car I have seen......loved it

4748, a year ago,3,"Almost bought one of these. I like the amount of space and how souped up you can customize it. The shape isn’t my favorite and also it accelerates a little slower than my liking. Long road life though, recommend to anyone with a small family or with small delivery needs."
4749, a year ago,4,My best friend drives this car and it’s SO CUTE! Comes in lots of different colors and some even have backup cameras. You can park anywhere in this thing but forget storage space or having a comfortable road trip with 4 people!
4750, a year ago,3,"Smaller than my liking but gets fantastic mileage. A good small sized around town car, cons being its limitations for my everyday needs (storage, 4-wheel drive, passenger space. Recommend to anyone trying to save money on gas."
4751, a year ago,4,"Bought it used and it had very little mileage. Excellent to drive, moderate gas mileage and it is quiet when you drive."
4752, a year ago,5,My sister owns a Toyota Camry. She absolutely loves the car. One thing I love about Toyota’s is you can keep putting miles on them and they will still run. They are a nice car.
4753, a year ago,5,"Exelente, me encanta su potencia, es espacioso por dentro, la velocidad es increíble y además es bonito. Me encanta la comodidad al interior, la capacidad es amplia, caben varias personas! Genial!"

4759, a year ago,4,"It’s good, Toyota’s in general run forever. I have close to 200k miles and still runs really great. As long as you keep up with maintenance you can basically drive it until the wheels fall off."
4760, a year ago,5,"Amo este carro, lo cómodo que es, como corre, su interior y que no gasta mucha gasolina es súper económico a cuando gasolina se habla. Un total éxito!"

4772, a year ago,5,Great spacious SUV. I bought the car 6 years ago and gave loved it the whole time. Toyota is a trust worthy company and builds lasting vehicles. They are expensive both worth the price. I will always drive this type of car!
4773, a year ago,5,Had a Corolla for eight years and loved it. Pretty much the only con was it didn’t have AWD.
4774, a year ago,4,Not a bad car. Wish it had a little more room for the driver but overall not bad. Sits a little high so when it’s windy the car seems to blow back and forth in the road. But it’s a good first little car to have
4775, a year ago,2,Very unsteady from a passenger point of view. Found the car shaky at first not sure why
4776,a year ago,4,Overall this is a very great car especially for new drivers!  Engine seems to last forever and maintenance is low cost.

4778, a year ago,4,Love my sienna. Especially with two growing boys. Said I would never be a van mom but I wouldn’t trade it right now. It’s so easy especially with a bad shoulder
4779, a year ago,5,I want one so bad! Had one as a rental and have decided this will be my next car. Not a large blind spot and so comfy to drive
4780, a year ago,5,"Amazing driving experience. Not cheap by any means or budget friendly. Takes a lot of gas, but loved driving it and being a passenger."
4781, a year ago,4,Not a flashy car. But everything you need when you are budget conscious and just need a reliable ride. It will definitely last you a long time if you are trying to save money.
4782, a year ago,4,It was a little unwieldy but you could put a lot of cargo and people in. Not glamorous at all but a great family car/parent mobile. Definitely more adorable than luxury cars. Recommend for families.
4783, a year ago,5,I mean the mileage itself speaks for it. Sports mode when I wanted to go faster was great! Although the mileage suffered then. It’s slightly expensive but you save a lot if gas if you drive in eco mode. I wish there was an eco sports mode.
4784, a year ago,5,"Great reliable car! I drove it a long time ago so don’t remember how it handled. But it was a great economy car. We had the cloth seats so that was kinda not attractive, but it got you everywhere you wanted to go."
4785, a year ago,5,"Mine’s a 2007 Scion tC. It is very reliable. I have about 85k miles on it now and I had bought it second hand with 75k miles. I love how it handles corners and acceleration. Absolutely recommend it! I added a Bluetooth adapter and a wireless charging stand, so technologically I have no complaints either!"

4789,a year ago,4,"Big chunky but i like it. 
Great for small trip.
 Even went from California to Newyork with my dorm stuff.  
A little bit loud but tolerable."
4790, a year ago,4,"Hasta el momento no tuve la oportunidad de conducir uno de esta marca, pero mi padre tuvo uno cuando yo era pequeña y recuerdo que él siempre dijo que era un excelente carro, que si hacia el merito a la publicidad que le hacían. Seguramente seguirán teniendo muy buena calidad. "
4791,a year ago,4,this brand is super comfortable when you ride and when you are inside you do not feel the speed in which you go
4792, a year ago,5,I love my Camry! It’s a SE 2017 and runs so perfect you would think your in a 2020 lol. The only improvement I would suggest are tints coming with the car but that’s just a personal preference. For a person shopping for a new car I recommend this car because it’s affordable and reliable.
4793, a year ago,5,"Love love love driving a RAV4! It’s so easy to maneuver, has great space, and is such a safe car to drive. The lane departure warnings and safety features that have been added in the last few years make this car incredibly safe for all passengers!"
4794, a year ago,4,I owned a pre-owned Toyota Corolla for about 3 years. It drove so well and was quick and easy to navigate with a ton of trunk space. The trickiest part was toward the end of owning the car it kept having a ton of mechanical issues pop up which resulted in me selling the car and moving on. Overall a great starter car!
4795, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my Prius. I had a 45 minute commute and it cut my gas usage in half if not more. It’s beyond easy to maneuver and was affordable on my non profit salary. It has even saved me a lot in gas money. I compare the driving feel to driving a space ship, it feels tech-y and so quiet and eco friendly."
4796,a year ago,5,"I am most definitely in love with this suv I can fit my child comfortably, the trunk is huge, and it’s so comfortable for me as well. The 2020 Toyota RAV4 is by far my most favorite vehicle I have driven yet!"
4797, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Prius! It is way make spacious than you realize. Lots of trunk space as well. Just got back from taking it across county and the gas mileage was amazing!
4798, a year ago,4,Love our 4Runner! Loves of cargo space and room for passengers. Can also tow our boat.
4799, a year ago,5,My mom owns a RAV4 that I’ve driven a few times and it is soooo nice. Such a smooth ride. Really reliable. Great in the snow as well. It is definitely pricey but Toyota’s have a great reputation for a reason. Plus they hold their value.
4800,a year ago,5,"It a really good car, I will recommend it for you if you have a family, it not that expensive"
4801,a year ago,5,"It a really good car for family, and it comfortable, and I don’t know if I am pros and cons"
4802,a year ago,5,An awesome car!! My family member has it and it’s still a great car after having it already 10 years. The seats are the most comfortable seats of any truck I’ve been in. If you need a big car buy this one!!
4803, a year ago,4,"I had 4 wheel drive Matrix and I really enjoyed driving it. However, I prefer hybrid or electric cars."
4804, a year ago,5,"My husband has a Toyota Camry and I drive it every now and then as well. I really love this car! It’s 4 door, great space inside, but has a sporty appearance on the outside. And a bonus is that it gets great gas mileage! It’s a smooth ride and fun to drive!"
4805,a year ago,5,"The 4Runner is an impeccable car. It has great milage and it is an incredibly reliable car. The steering and navigation systems are amazing. The price is worth every penny for this car. I need to get a car soon, and I will definitely be getting a Toyota 4Runner."
4806, a year ago,5,"I have this car currently and it’s been a great car! It’s very safe, reliable, and drives awesome! Plus it’s good on gas!"
4807, a year ago,5,"Oh my god this car is my absolute favorite and I can’t wait to say I own one! My fiancé has this car and I love the way it drives, it feels like a million dollar car with luxury, and the hands free is so easy to use!"
4808, a year ago,5,"Great and very reliable car! Owned my first 2000 Camry at 18 & I’ve had it for 5yrs now. It has a slight blown gasket but it’s still a drivable car. Getting it fixed though.Recently bought my second car a 2012 Toyota Camry, no issues and super great on gas!"
4809, a year ago,3,"My parents have this car. I only like the amount of space. The button for the sliding door isn’t always of use, steering wheel is looser than I’m used to, and the pedals aren’t as sensitive so I’d have to press down more to accelerate or brake than I do with my car. But I do like the power seat and rear camera when reversing"
4810, a year ago,5,These SUVs are incredibly durable and versatile. There is a reason that you still see so many of them on the road after years. They are quality vehicles that will last a lifetime with the proper care.
4811, a year ago,4,"Great car, my mother inlaw has a 2013 and they hold their value very well. She keeps her car under a 3 wall carport and it has had paint issues that Toyota did not want to fix."
4812, a year ago,5,A nothing special ride or feel but they last!!! Mom’s 2000 Camry made it to 500000km. I gave driven a few RAV4s and they are solid but nothing fancy and not a luxurious feel if that’s what you are looking for.
4813, a year ago,4,"Un excelente vehiculo, muy rendidor, motor de buen manejo, buena pintura simplememte un increible vehiculo paea solteros o para parejas ♥️"
4814, a year ago,4,"Nice little economy car that was really comfortable done riding and a lot of people I know swear by this, car￼"
4815, a year ago,4,Sporty little car I liked it sort of like an SUV I was considering picking one up but I bought a used car.￼
4816, a year ago,5,Reliable and lasts you a long time with no issues if used reasonably. Both my mom and sister own a Toyota Corolla and it has great features. I also like that it holds to it’s value more than American cars.
4817, a year ago,5,Had a 1995 Corolla with 200k drives like a tank .easy to maintain and fix small stuff mechanically. Had the car until 2015 till rust  ate everything.  Engine still runs good.

4823, a year ago,3,Cute little car amazing and on gas and decent storage for the size of the vehicle for sure. Not the most comfortable but great for the price and it will most likely last forever
4824, a year ago,5,"My mother loves her Toyota camry, she got her first one in 2009 and drove it for 11 years and out over 300,000 miles on it. Minor issues here and there but nothing major and still counting! She just bought a new Toyota camry and I think she'll buy a third before the first one finally kicks it."

4847, a year ago,4,"I’ve driven a 2006 Corolla. Honestly for its time it was a decent car. It had all the essentials a car needed at the time. However, in todays day and age it really is a big downgrade. Not only that but the space in the car was pretty bad but it was known to be a smaller car so it really isn’t a big deal."
4848, a year ago,5,"Love my baby, she’s perfect in every way! Love how small yet roomy she is! I can’t imagine myself with any other car."

4850, a year ago,5,This car glides instead of rides. It has the feel of a luxury car in a price point for an average joe. The Toyota Camry is very spacious and comfortable with a rocking ac and amazing feel. I have driven and been a passenger in this car and I love it. You don’t feel all the bumps in the road in this car. I’m a Lexus lover and I can tell you that the Camry has all the luxury of the Lexus (same maker) but without being as flashy. This is what I call old reliable

4853, a year ago,5,"The  Camry is the archetypal midsize family sedan. Though it has grown larger over many generations, the latest, redesigned 2018 model checks in at roughly the same exterior dimensions as its predecessor. That's fine t's plenty big enough already, thanks. The 2018 Camry's styling is a big departure from the norm, however."
4854, a year ago,3,It’s a smaller SUV. It does have road noise. So you’ll need to turn up the music or talk louder when you drive on the highways.
4855, a year ago,5,This is the car I am currently driving and I am in love. I have a 2016 and the only maintenance I have had to do was routine oil changes and fluid top offs.... I have no had any other issues
4856, a year ago,5,"My dad long ago had one of these trucks and I really liked it, it is very comfortable and good quality ideal for a family, it is very beautiful and very good, I recommend it to everyone"
4857, a year ago,5,"The best car for people who don’t want a gas guzzler but still want room and space. This is the absolute best of both worlds. I never liked small SUV’s before and after driving this and using it, I want one."
4858, a year ago,5,"1996 4Runner smells funny and is covered in wear and tear esthetically but she’s still running like she did 10 years ago. No matter what, Toyota is the most reliable brand that cannot be compared to other makes."
4859, a year ago,5,Toyota is the best car manufacturer. You’ll get so much use out of this car and the maintenance is inexpensive. I can’t think of a more reliable car than a Toyota. I’ve had two and they both have well over 100k miles and still run great!
4860, a year ago,5,"Bought my car brand new in 2006, and I still have it. Almost 230,000 miles and this has been the best car ever. I keep up with maintenance but I’ve yet to have any serious issues that couldn’t be resolved easily. I love my Toyota and will never own a different Make of car."
4861, a year ago,4,I like rav4 as its very specious and its comfortable to drive. I also like the look of this car. Milage is good too. The only thing i don’t like is it doesn’t have ac vent for back seats which is their in any other brand base models as well.
4862, a year ago,5,"This was a great, reliable car that I loved and wouldn’t have traded it had it not been for needing more room. Toyota is a great brand that I would buy from again!"
4863, a year ago,5,It's the only car I've ever owned. I've had it for 11 years. Runs beautifully. 100k miles in. I love my Corolla.
4864, a year ago,3,"It’s a good reliable car . Just got it brand new in October, really good on gas and the new ones are sportier.Toyota Motor Company"
4865, a year ago,4,I love how it’s an suv that drives like a truck! The seats are not very comfortable and could use some improvement. The third row is a little cramped and it’s a little too expensive for these flaws.
4866, a year ago,5,I have had my Highlander Hybrid for 1 year! It’s such an amazing vehicle and the features are endless!  You would never know that this vehicle was hybrid because of the power.  It even has a tow package!
4867, a year ago,5,Súper cómoda  grande. Espaciosa es demaciado buena para viajes largos con la familia me encanta
4868, a year ago,5,"I love my RAV4, these is so much room. I can haul just about anything. I regularly do vendor events and am able to get two 6’ tables, 6 totes and more in by laying the seats down."
4869, a year ago,5,My first car! Adorable I got the sports version interior is perfect actually drives pretty fast
4870,a year ago,4,Very comfy crossover/suv. Realibility to the highest level. Performance is great and very spacious.
4871,a year ago,5,Very fun to drive with its very sharp steering that most supercars have to offer with a fraction of its price. Easy access on bolt on diy parts and accessories.
4872,a year ago,5,This is my second Prius I’ve purchased new and for the price point and mpg it’s an excellent value. If you can get a low interest rate then you’ll save a ton
4873, a year ago,4,"This is a great car out of college. It has plenty of room for friends and lots of space for storage. It’s reliable and safe and has nice features. Not too big and not too small, I love my RAV4."
4874, a year ago,3,My friend has this car. It’s alright. I’m not a huge fan of it though. Not the car for me.
4875, a year ago,5,I love my car! It’s safe for my child and me and drives so so smooth. It even has a sunroof for those crazy days when I want to have some extra wind in my hair.
4876,a year ago,4,"It’s a nice car, but too big for my liking. It is more difficult to park because it is such a big car. However, it’s great for family road trips as there is a lot of space in the car."
4877,a year ago,5,"I like this car. It’s big enough where I feel safe driving it. Additionally, there is a lot of space in the trunk. I travel back and forth for school and the back seats can be collapsed to transport more things. It works well and the maintenance is standard."
4878, a year ago,5,Great suv. Has all the options. Comfort and stylish. Very dependable and great on gas.
4879, a year ago,5,The car is a dream I drive ewery day with that car and I don’t need to tank ewrery minut. It is so chep to take care of it! 💯
4880, a year ago,5,"I Love my Sienna van very roomy, smooth ride, great on fuel! Great to get the Family together for a road trip!!"
4881, a year ago,5,"I had Toyota Corolla in red color  for 3 years  very good with gas and customer service good too , the car has very good sound system ."
4882, a year ago,3,"I purchased a 2007 Toyama Yaris back in 2016. It’s my first and only car. I like it for a first car. For a 2007 car it’s not bad. It has room for a usb. It’s comfortable. No problems yet for me and it was already used over 100,000 miles when I first got it. Now it’s about 135,000 and I still think it was definitely a good purchase.
Mine isn’t the Harch Back so it’s even cuter. The speakers are my favorite. Great stereo sounds. I love it"
4883, a year ago,1,I owned the 2018 Toyota Camry XLE and the car itself wasn’t too bad. It had issues that needed to be fixed but the service department at dealership in our town were awful. There were things they told us had to be complained about by so many people before Toyota would fix it. Hmmm so warranty pointless. But all in all the dealership in our town ruined my experience with purchasing a new Toyota. so I’ll never purchase one again.
4884, a year ago,3,"cute car drives good color nice amazing, you shouldn’t race it wouldn’t work out, i love it tho amazing car"
4885, a year ago,5,I love this Toyota Camry model since school. I really like the look is nice and car so comfortable.
4886, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my car, there’s so much room but also has that sorry feel and not to big to drive. It’s very nice and gets great gas mileage on the highway"
4887,a year ago,4,"Test drive for possible purchase. It looks like a spaceship inside. Since that what you are looking anyway, the ugly exterior isn’t such a big deal. Too bad the battery warranty is terrible."
4888, a year ago,5,"This is the ultimate mom car if you don’t want a van. We love this car more than others we have had! Easy to get in and out of! Lots of room! Only down fall gas, but totally worth it in my mind."
4889, a year ago,4,"The new 2020 RAV4 has a bigger spacious body allowing more room for the back seat passengers. Drives smooth, has the automatic shut off when you press the brakes to save you on gas. The seats are a little stiff so long drives might be a little uncomfortable. Other than that it’s a keeper!!"
4890, a year ago,5,It is totally reliable and safe! We have never been disappointed in the drive or the care of this car! It’s pets are not outrageous if it needs fixing. Gas is decent it doesn’t cost too much to fill up. Only negative wish there 3rd row left some room for trunk space.
4891, a year ago,4,It’s a toyota so it drives amazing but I do wish it was a little bit more of a full SUV. It’s cute and fun size.
4892, a year ago,5,"Great car, great gas mileage. Small , light easy to navigate around the driver seat area. Has a really good warranty and we had our last one for almost 11 years. So these vehicles last!"
4893, a year ago,4,"I loved my Toyota RAV4. It had leather seats, seat warmers and autostart. Iived in Alaska so those features were a must."
4894, a year ago,4,My mom owns this car. Very comfortable and affordable car. Bluetooth connection with USB ports as well. The only downside is the seats in the model that she has get dirty very fast. Even if you spill water on the seats it will leave a stain.
4895, a year ago,3,"Its a 2007, so the space is lacking. The upholstery is hard to clean and could be a bit cushier."
4896,a year ago,5,"Very nice and very good car, certainly for the environment or milieu. Has high power but I just sat once in this car."
4897, a year ago,5,I loved my Toyota Camry it was very low maintenance and durable. If I was to buy another car it’d definitely be a Camry I love they’re durability and the way that they look now. It’s just the right size not to big but not too small
4898,a year ago,5,"Excelente car ! The FJ Cruiser is the perfect vehicle 
The rubber floor and water resistant seats, the ability to tow 5,000 lbs. and the off road and bad weather capabilities make it a joy to own.
although the FJ is a great vehicle for what it's designed for . We upgraded from a pop up camper to a 21' hybrid that when loaded approaches 5,000#. I absolutely loved the FJ and miss it terribly but the great thing is they are APPRECIATING in value, well cared for FJ. You can't go wrong owning one of these great vehicles!!!!"
4899, a year ago,5,"This car has been in my family for 17 years now. Problems come up more often now that it’s older and has been driven halfway across the country multiple times a year, every year, but the problems are never too major, or at least the major problems are extremely rare. Smoothest ride ever. Tons of space, can fit a whole adult sized bike inside the back of the car when you put the back set of seats down. Comfortable, worth the price. If you’re looking for a minivan, this one will not disappoint."
4900, a year ago,5,I bought my car used. It’s a later model car but it runs great. It’s very good on gas. The replacement parts for regular Maintenance￼ are pretty low. The air takes a while to get cold even after having it filled. The Interior￼ has held up pretty well. Except for the dash bored which is cracked from sun damage.
4901, a year ago,5,Great car and awesome gas mileage and only compliant small inside when you have 3 kids ... hoping to up grade to a 3rd row car eventually. But this still is a great car ... these seem to last forever - stick to that regular car maintenance and you will be fine
4902, a year ago,5,Very nice model and super spacious. This car has 6 cylinders so not my favorite. The rav4 is much better but this car is good for a family of over 5 people. I don’t think this car is expensive compared to other modals.
4903, a year ago,5,I had an older 4Runner and I loved it. It had a lot of space inside it and for the most part never gave me problems. I ran it to almost 300000. So it’s a very reliable car. Pretty much nothing beats a Toyota. Best cars ever.
4904, a year ago,5,I own the RAV4 XLE and owning a Toyota RAV4 has always been my dream. This car to me is perfect. It’s very spacious. And I love the look of it. The look is much better than the older versions. I would definitely recommended this car to my friends.
4905, a year ago,5,"Confortable, espacioso, super seguro me encanta, super rápido, económico y lo mejor que las piezas so fáciles de conseguir"
4906, a year ago,5,Very reliable car. Smooth ride. Very economic and fuel efficient. Very comfortable interior. I really trust toyota
4907,a year ago,5,"Great car! Lots of room, with smooth handling! Add bells and whistles if you like. Very affordable. If you get third row seating it is kinda cramped, but for the price, safety, and endurance of this model with a name you can trust, two thumbs up!"
4908, a year ago,5,It’s the perfect size for our family of four. It has enough bells and whistles to satisfy me and my kids without overwhelming us with the tech and setup. The stowaway third row has been amazing for space in the back and we honestly forget we have the option for more seats because we use the back too much.
4909,a year ago,4,"Good price. Comfy seats. Futuristic features, but low on power. And expensive to fix. Endurance is not what some traditional cars offer, and for the cost, you want it to last. Great car for someone who travels or drives a lot because of the great gas mileage!"
4910, a year ago,4,Très bonne voiture rien à dire fonctionne très bien ce n’est ps moi qui conduit personnellement mais ma famille et amis
4911, a year ago,4,We have had our Camry for 5 years. It’s a great daily driver. Gets really good gas mileage. Came with a back up camera and nice interior. Really affordable and will run forever if kept up with the regular maintenance.
4912, a year ago,5,I am a huge fan of the Toyota Corolla. I have owned 2 of these type cars and they literally run until the wheels fall off. Toyota in general is an amazing car company and I have never heard one thing bad about them!
4913, a year ago,5,"I love my Rav 4! Any Toyota has always been reliable, but I love driving this model. It has all safety features I look for with being a Mom, and driving around my little one. It has the ability to even add more optional features. Highly recommend this vehicle for anyone looking for a safe, reliable, and sporty SUV!"
4914, a year ago,4,I loved this car! It is super comfortable and is a great size! Although ours did have many problems but Toyota did take it back and give us credit towards our new vehicle (the Hylander)
4915, a year ago,5,The car runs so smoothly and you really feel in control of it. Seats are pretty comfortable. I don’t think the car needs any improvement whatsoever. It is affordable and it’s a good car runs great wouldn’t trade it for any other car.
4916, a year ago,5,"I drove a Camry as a rental, and know several owners. It’s a great mid/large size sedan. Plenty of arm room and headspace. I’m 5’5”, but if you’re say 6’3”, it might be a little tight. All levels are nice. I’d be happy and proud to drive it. It makes road tripping fun. Turns easy. Looks great. Worth the money!"
4917, a year ago,5,"The Sienna is such a smooth ride with ample space to do all sorts of activities. As a driver, there’s no disconnect. You flow with the twists and turns. It lacks a lunch when you need to get up and go. No problem accelerating, amazing handling, and the breaks are phenomenal to halt such a beast. As a rider, you can lay back in your seat, read, draw, watch movies, daydream while staring out the window. I love all of the cup holders. There are so many, but I can always use more! Drop down tables would be nice for the middle row. The Sienna is super affordable for all of the amenities. You’ll be happy to make the payment in order to drive and ride in such a luxurious vehicle. We have a black one. The original “Vanborghini”."
4918,a year ago,5,"I have a 2010 Toyota 4 Runner.  I was one of the 1st to buy the new model.  I have never had 1 problem with this car.  Love the sun roof and back window that goes down which enables me to haul long boards or items that might need extra space.  My dog rides in the car as well and loves it too.  It has a 3 row with is super small but will carry several people if needed. I have 170,000 miles on the car and hope I can get another 170,000 more."
4919, a year ago,5,I love my Prius! Mine is 2015 Prius 2 hybrid . I drive a lot between LA and Orange county so Im in traffic a lot. I needed something that wouldn’t chug gas while idle in traffic. It fills up on about $25 and I get about 500 miles on a full tank give it take. It is also pretty spacey for a small car and with seats down in the back you can fit a good amount of cargo.
4920, a year ago,5,This is our family car purchased in 2011. Still runs well and has done well for our family of 4. Tons of room in the back for when we’d have to bring a double stroller places. Perfect family vehicle.
4921, a year ago,5,I purchased my corolla in 2004 and it still runs well. It gets me to where I need to go. There’s a bit of wear on the outside but that is because we have to park it outside. It’s a great car and I recommend it!
4922, a year ago,5,Love it. Super comfortable and reliable! Definitely gas efficient and gets you from point a to b no problem
4923, a year ago,5,"Love my RAV4! We are now on our second one (2007 and 2018) and both have been extremely reliable, easy to maintain and enjoyable to drive. While I don’t love their most current body style, I would still highly recommend these cars to those looking for a great crossover SUV"
4924, a year ago,5,"Only drove this vehicle for a couple days.  It was my rental vehicle while my Jeep was undergoing repairs.   Loved this vehicle.   It was a deep shade of red.  Not too bright.  It was the shade of red you get half way through a tootsie roll pop.  It Was high enough off the ground.   I hate a low seating car!  Extremely comfortable seats.  Very smooth ride. It was in middle of winter in Maine so it handled extremely well with all the snow and ice.  Lots of space in front and back seats.  And the rear area behind the back seats was really spacious.  I didn’t really use that area due to not needing it in the such short time I had it, but I could tell it would hold a lot of stuff.  Heater heated up really fast.  If I ever am in market for another vehicle I def would consider buying this model."
4925, a year ago,5,I want this car for myself I like how smooth it drives and how much gas mileage it gets.
4926, a year ago,5,Very comfortable and really beautiful! Economic and there is a lot of spaces. The only cons it’s the price but it worth it. Will definitely keep my car for a long time!
4927, a year ago,5,Very smooth ride. Loved the interior and the features. The car took right off while pressing the gas. I believe this will be my next car purchase. I’m in love with it!
4928, a year ago,5,Reliable and easy maintenance. Great for new drivers or for families! It’s especially large and very spacious if you have kids or need to load up a bunch of stuff for moving. The new design is also much more aggressive and youthful looking!
4929, a year ago,3,Gas guzzler. Smooth ride. Real quiet. But not the car for me. It’s a beautiful car with all the bells and whistles. But it isn’t for me.
4930, a year ago,4,Great SUV for the size and price. Plenty of room for 4 adults. Plenty of room to carry your bags while traveling. Add built in cover for the back.
4931, a year ago,5,Brilliant car for me as it’s just me. Will be upgrading once I need a bigger one but it’s reliable and looks cute!
4932, a year ago,5,I live the mileage on this car. The car rides smoothly and works great when I have driven it. I wish it was a larger car. It’s a bit on the pricey side for a new/used car. I would recommend
4933, a year ago,5,"I own an 2006 Corolla but I absolutely love it. This is the best car O have had it gets excellent gas, it’s spacious without being bulky. And is so easy to care for, I know nothing about cars but any minor issues I have had I have been able to easily fix by myself."
4934, a year ago,5,Oh my god this car was amazing we got to use a 2021 Camry for a few months while awaiting our car to have its recap parts sent to the dealership. The specs on this car are superb! I want one bad !!
4935, a year ago,4,I have a red Toyota Corolla LE and it’s a nice car but I’d prefer a Camry. We’ve had it for almost four years and no problems at all but I want to get something new. Other than that it’s a great car good on gas and Toyota’s are great!
4936, a year ago,5,"This is a nice car, if you have a need for speed you’re definitely going to get it with this car, plus it also is a very adult car."
4937, a year ago,5,Most reliable car I’ve ever owned. I commute a ridiculous amount of miles a week & this car definitely gets me there and back
4938, a year ago,5,I don’t drive just yet lol I am actually learning how to drive to get my license but I can say I love driving my dad’s Camry! The car drives smoothly and it’s easy to drive for me
4939, a year ago,4,I love everything about this car from the interior to the exterior of it. Really love how you can switch up the mode from sports to eco
4940,a year ago,4,I think is a good car like in my Oo ion my car doesn’t have any problem to this day and I’m happy
4941,a year ago,4,Great car for a sedan! The reliability and the maintenance is within good budget plus the features are great. Got to test drive a 2018 one in search of a car. Very smooth.
4942,a year ago,4,Great and reliable car. We've had our Rav4 for 7 years and had been on so many road trips around the country. Toyota is the only car brand I'd trust with reliability and price
4943, a year ago,5,"Sturdy, awesome feature. Very large, difficult to park. But a strong and safe car. Fits a lot of passengers."
4944, a year ago,4,Durable car. Safe. A lot of family friends own this car and have used it for moving in and out of apartments or houses.
4945,a year ago,5,"I LOVE my RAV4! The size is perfect, not too big but not too small! I get great gas mileage and the car drives so well."
4946, a year ago,5,"Lo ame demasiado definitivamente un auto que es demasiado cómodo y ergonomico , de verdad que es todo sueño"
4947, a year ago,5,"I’ve had two Camrys and my mom has had 3—needless to say, we’re pretty big fans of this car. They’re sleek yet simple, and always reliable. We’ve had very little trouble with them over the years, & they have great longevity."
4948, a year ago,5,It is a good car for those who take care of the environment and protect it from emissions. An economical car that runs on electricity and is ideal for protecting the environment from toxic substances
4949,a year ago,5,"Love it!! Went from a car and wanted something bigger and this is everything and more than what i wanted. The only way to improve would be updating the look of the key! For how new the car is, the remote looks like it’s 10 years old."
4950, a year ago,2,Basic and standard. Down side it dosent have much storage space in the trunk. A little tight in the back personally if your a passenger. Not a car for snow or mountains. More of a local flat road car.
4951, a year ago,4,Comfortable but not much trunk storage. It’s really good on Gas and runs smoothly. My husbands had the electronic energy saver feature which helps reduce the amount of gas you burn. It was a touch button to start the car which was nice and the engine ran so quietly.
4952, a year ago,5,This was a very good car had no trouble with it. Unfortunately a drunk driver hit me and it got total. Great family vehicle
4953, a year ago,5,This is my husbands car so I don’t drive it much. He loves this car and is hopefully that it will last him a lifetime. I am not a sedan fan but the car is roomy and we haven’t had any major issues. We did have one where the door wouldn’t lock and it cost us $100 to fix ourselves. More like $500 to be done at Toyota.
4954,a year ago,3,"The RAV4 is just an “okay” vehicles.  It’s on the pricey side for what you get.  Seems like everything is an add on or you have to get packages to get what you want, and often times it comes with things you don’t want.  The passenger comfort isn’t there.  Needs work."
4955, a year ago,5,"Although I'll admit Toyota is not my favourite automotive maker, the Corolla is definitely a hallmark of why this brand is so well known and beloved by many. As one of the most common Asian imports, it becomes easy to see why once you've gotten to know this guy. Affordable, user friendly, accessible, and relatively easy on the eyes, haha. This is my MIL's daily driver which I drive often. I appreciate the torque in a rather pedestrian car. There is definitely a beauty in the mundane, and this model is one of those things."
4956, a year ago,5,"In love with my 2019 Camry! It’s clean, simple, gets me everywhere, and BA to drive!"
4957, a year ago,5,Great car! Easy to maneuver without too much effort. Smooth ride and I loved bring up high and feeling safe. Especially the TRO package.
4958, a year ago,5,I love the new Toyota Camry. Drives so smooth and the interior is so nice. Really good on gas and very cheap compared to other companies to maintain.
4959, a year ago,5,"Loved this car. Huge trunk space which was crucial with twins, smooth ride, never had any issues with this car and was sad when we had to upgrade"
4960, a year ago,4,"Spacious car for its size, though the center console is so far out that it was uncomfortable to lean an elbow on. Smooth drive"
4961, a year ago,5,"Love it. Best car I’ve ever owned. Stable, reliable, and kind of stylish. I don’t know if I will ever own a different car!"
4962, a year ago,5,"Awesome car, it’s always running, those tires te so good as well and also if you love run or something, this car is for you? It’s so affordable as well and comfortable, I recommend this car a lot."
4963, a year ago,5,"I’m on my 2nd Toyota Camry. This car keeps going and going. I put 300,000 miles on my first one and sold it in good condition. Bought a 2020 model and am very pleased with it. I don’t see myself going to a different car any time soon."
4964, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota 4runner. The car is dependable, reliable, durable. Its the perfect family car. Does pretty decent on gas. The trunk is huge for groceries or trips or beach items since we live on the beach. I would recommend this car."
4965, a year ago,5,I love this car. It’s old (2007) but run perfect. I had another 2007 corolla with over 275k miles on it and it’s still running! Love it!!
4966, a year ago,5,I have a Scion tC and it has been good to me. It drives well in the snow and rain since it’s front wheel drive. It’s a lot of fun to drive in those conditions.
4967, a year ago,5,Love Toyota Camry they are great on gas and eco friendly not super fancy but cute  make it look more sporty
4968,a year ago,5,LOVE MY 4Runner so much! The space is great and it drives so well. I would recommend it to anyone
4969, a year ago,4,Ik kon het model waar ik echt in heb gereden niet zien maar een toyota is een goede auto beetje aan de kleine kant voor ons maar dat geldt niet voor iedereen!
4970, a year ago,5,"I LOVE THIS CAR, I am determined to never get rid of this car. One day it’s going to be a classic and my kids will thank me for keeping it in the family. I have put 70,000 miles on mine and have never had 1 issue. Have kids? Have a dog? Hate small cars? This is for you!"
4971, a year ago,5,I love Toyota! I miss my moms car so much it drives so good! We really like how it drives in it its nothing like other cars 🥰
4972, a year ago,5,The best SUV on the market! Perfect vehicle for my small family that’s always on the go!
4973, a year ago,5,Comfortable and roomy. Great gas mileage and safety features. Great starter SUV.
4974, a year ago,5,This is the 2nd Camry I have. Such a great car for a great price. Lots of trunk space and great gas mileage.
4975, a year ago,5,I have had my Toyota Camry less than a year and I absolutely love it I have always had Chevrolets so this was my first Toyota and I really love all the safety features that Toyota gives also their cars are no longer vehicles for just teenagers or older people they are perfect for the every day family or single person they have become more of a luxury vehicle than they ever were before￼
4976,a year ago,5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Prius! The eco impact, and fuel savings alone make this car worth checking out; but if you are someone who just simply likes smaller cars I think you will love this car. I personally have a model C (the smallest line) and still find that there is ample space for 4 adults to fit comfortably on even longer drives (and for 5 to get cozy if needed). The features in the car are nice, and it runs so quietly! I absolutely recommend test driving one of you are in the market for a car."
4977,a year ago,5,"I love my Highlander! It is comfy and spacious, plenty of room for our family of 5 plus a few friends. The gas mileage seems better than our previous SUV, and Toyota Hs included some nice upgrades features even on their lower models of the Highlander.
There isn’t much that they could improve on, and it is on par with the cost of other SUV like vehicles, so I would absolutely recommend stopping by a dealership and checking one out."
4978, a year ago,5,I really love the sienna because it’s so spacious and my kids can be there so comfortable and i can use it for everything ❤️

4981, a year ago,5,"This was one of my first cars. I bought it as soon as I graduated UCLA. What an amazing compact vehicle. I had it for years and it never broke down. Even more amazing that I got a great price for it when I traded it in with 150,000 miles on it.  I have bought Toyota ever since. And I switched all my family to Toyota and I drive the RAV4 today and I LOVE IT! "

4984, a year ago,5,The last decade of 4runners are hands down my favorite car. I have owned two. They are great for anything life throws at you. The are durable and hold value extremely well.  When you pay for quality you get quality.
4985, a year ago,5,This is a great ride!  The gas mileage sells itself but there is a surprising amount of space in this car.   With proper maintenance I will easily pass 200k miles.   Great for commuting or just cruising around town.
4986, a year ago,5,"I don`t have words to describe how much I love my car. This 2015 toyota Rav4 is my first car, I got it used from a dealership, and when I bought it I did so because I loved the color red on it, the size and price. I ended up making the best deal of my life. This car doens`t give me any head aches at all.  Last winter it was almost funny, if it wasn`t sad to see so many people stuck in snow while I was driving like a princess. I love my car because it is my source of money, it takes me to places I wanna go, and it represents my freedom like nothing else does. "

4989, a year ago,4,"Loved this vehicle, super confortable for long and difficult rides. It holds the whole family which would be eight of us. The only thing is I fee it’s better for men because the steering wheel is kind of hard when turning."

4997, a year ago,5,"Very spacious, reliable car. Great to go from point a to b with and versatile enough for anything. With the seats down, you can put lengths of wood in the back, parts are inexpensive as it’s just a 5-door corolla. And largely interchangeable with a Pontiac Vibe."

5000, a year ago,3,"It was decent, I mean a car is a car and I am biased because I like SUVs but it feels very low. I would say updating it with modern technology and screens could always help for sure!"
5001, a year ago,4,"I have the 2013 version of this. It is a good car, decent mpg. I like that it feels rugged and it is actually pretty roomy. I love that the seats aren’t leather so it’s not burning you when you get in. The air conditioning is kinda weak."
5002, a year ago,5,"They are amazing, and so practical. I always can tell you Toyota are the best car I ever had in my life and I can told you with my close eyes you have to have a Toyota in your life. Believe you will have a best car ever. #toyota #corolla #free #happy #drivesave"

Completely satisfied with the car and my 4 star rating is simply because it is obviously not a high end luxury vehicle."
5009,a year ago,4,Had this as a loaner car a few months back and enjoyed it. The ride was smooth with a good amount of options to change the feel of the ride and the drive. Good sound system and ac. Gas mileage seemed good too. Roomy and comfortable
5010, a year ago,4,"This little car floats when you drive. It's also fast (yes), very gas efficient, and compact. The size makes parallel parking a breeze. The only downside is.... It causes leg pains for people with long legs like myself. I still would recommend it though."
5011, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota Camry. It's sporty, has a rearview camera, fast, and gas efficient. It has a lot of space in the back for carseats and for people sitting in the back with long legs. I wish they had a charger part in the pack and vents as well, as it can get quite stuffy in the back on a super hot day even with AC blasting."
5012, a year ago,4,"We just bought the 2020 Hylander and I love it! It is a very nice vehicle to drive! It’s looks great and it super comfortable! It has heated and cooled seats, it is definitely a would recommend car! It has so much room"

En su elaboración estos se rigen bajo los más  altos estándares de calidad, lo sé  porque hice mi pasantía de universidad en la principal distribuidora de Toyota de Venezuela y pude ver de primera mano todo lo que esta empresa debía tener para poder ser distribuidor de las partes internas de los carros Toyota.

It was great on gas mileage which was a huge plus because I did a lot of driving from Minnesota to Wisconsin multiple times a month.

I enjoy that there are some standard amenities on the car which are normally considered add one or on higher end models (heated seats). I don't like the cargo cover, DEFINITE downgrade in quality from prior prius. I appreciate the mileage, size, features of the car.  Overall I'm pretty happy with it and would recommend"
5059,a year ago,5,This is such a reliable car. My Camry is a 2007 and is still chugging along. It worked great for 2 carseats in the back. It has a good sized trunk that can fit a lot of luggage. It isn't the quietest car on the highway but it's much quieter than say a Prius. I've been very happy with it and would still be driving it daily if I hadn't run out of room for carseats.
5060, a year ago,5,Super nice cars. Drive very smoothly. Been looking at a lot of new cars recently because my boyfriend is looking to buy a car. These are the real deal. Super sleek and sporty looking. Has race car looks but just dependable

5095, a year ago,5,"Loved my 2002 Toyota Corolla, I had it for over a decade before selling it. This vehicle is fuel efficient, practical for everyday use. The car needed very little maintenance, ran perfectly fine, tune ups were reasonable cost. This vehicle was great for road trips, city driving and driving to work everyday. Parking was never a problem, car was compact and fit anywhere lol. Corolla is a wonderful vehicle"

5102, a year ago,5,"We leased our Toyota RAV4 in 2018. I think we will get another one when the lease is up. It is a smooth riding car with lots of creature comforts and safety features. We have not had any issues with it since we bought it. We deliver meals on Wheels a few times a week, and it's super convenient. I would like to have an automatic rear gate lift, a Sirius XM radio subscription and a compass in your next one, but we were trying to go ultra cheap last time. I think we'll spend a bit more this time. We will also look at other brands of SUV's. My husband is 6'3"" and 275 pounds, so he is a bit cramped in a lot of cars and SUV's. We will look at some midsized to see if they offer any more leg room. Most cars, trucks and SUV's nowadays have such big consoles in the center, there's very little leg room. The RAV4 was the best compact SUV for leg room when we shopped in 2018."
5103, a year ago,4,I owned a 4Runner a long time ago.  I loved it.  Only con was that it was a 2 door and hard for an adult to get in back seat
5104, a year ago,5,Since I started driving I've been driving smaller cars. So this is my first Toyota car brand. At first I was skeptical to purchase this Camry. Mostly I was worried about gas milage as it is a bigger car compare to what I was so used in driving. It's now over 2 years using it as my daily driver and I'm loving it.

5106, a year ago,5,"The newer model Camry's are extremely nice, I really don't know why I have to review a car I once rode in? I have a 4runner so would not purchase a Camry after sitting up so high driving."
5107, a year ago,4,"InglésIt is an ideal car for use. Feminine since it is very simple because it is automatic, the steering (steering wheel) is smooth and do not confine yourself to the double use of the feet because it is automatic, fuel-efficient, spacious and very comfortable"

5110, a year ago,5,My Camry is the best! So reliable! We’ve never had any serious issues with my 2012 Toyota Camry and it’s been so ridiculously reliable that I’ve never wanted to upgrade. Can’t beat a paid off car!
5111, a year ago,3,Corolla is a pretty basic car so there's nothing exciting or crazy about it. It's an entry level car for someone who just got into driving and i think this is a perfect car for such person. The car is easy to drive and pretty spacious as well as affordable.
5112, a year ago,5,Toyota’s are sooo reliable!! I have had mine for about 3 years now and it still runs smoothly. Parts for the car aren’t too expensive and it’s really good on gas

5116, a year ago,4,It is cute and a good car overall. It gets okay gas mileage but I had a Saturn that got better. The only other thing that I don't like about it yet is when my boyfriend gets in it's really hard for him to get comfortable I wish I could have gotten a slightly larger model. Overall for what I got and as well as it ran I'll probably end up getting another Toyota.
5117, a year ago,5,I think this is my favorite  brand car for a1st car. This car I actually bought  myself  and it was totally worth it.  Its super  spacious  and  comfortable . Its super  affordable compared to other brands.  I would  totally  recommend it  because it's a great  car.

5125, a year ago,4,I bought this brand new. Total impulse buy. I wish i would've know that the gas was only around 18mpg. The suv drives great. Bought mine with bucket seats. Very reliable

5135,a year ago,5,"I love this car. It is very reliable and is the perfect size for a young person. The only down side is it is a very small car for the part of the country I live in, which means if I were to get in a bad accident , I would be worried. I have been rear-ended before and needed to swerve quickly to the other side of the road to avoid hitting a truck that pulled out in front of me. I was going 50 mph and the car didn't flip- just a little swerving, but very controlled considering the circumstances. If you are a good driver, you will do well with this car."

I don't have anything bad to say about the Toyota Corolla, we have had this type of car in our family for a long time and we have never had any problems with them, the interior is nice and so is the style of the car. I like the outside look of the car just as much as the inside, its comfortable but stylish! It is an affordable car and easy to maintain and cheap on gas, a great option if you are looking! Toyota Motor Company "
5140, a year ago,4,"So we do really love our car and most of the issues I have could be addressed by simply getting a different model, but overall I still think my issues are important! I love that the doors open up really wide, but sometimes it’s annoying because the seats are a bit too far down to comfortably reach the handle (yes 1st world...). I love the spaciousness on the inside, the extra pull down cup holder in the back seat, the quality of the electronic dashboard, and the overall feel of the car as I drive. I wish the speakers were a little nicer, I wish the air flow was a bit stronger, and I wish there was a slightly deeper center console overall."
5141,a year ago,5,"Super reliable car. It’s wonderful for city use and road trips. Corolla’s are great on gas, it won’t burn your wallet each month. It’s a nice light car that is a perfect starter car and equally great for elders."

Was so easy and simple to drive. No fuss and straight to very thing on the dash.Then my driving instructor change his car towards the end of my driving exams to a 2016 Toyota Yaris. It was lovely to drive and very smooth I did find it was a bit cramped compared to the old model. But it's still a lovely car to drive and own.

5163, a year ago,5,"The Sequoia is a huge SUV. Every time I drive it, I feel like I can see everything. My mother owns a sequoia and this was the car I learned how to drive in. For first timers like me, it may seem scary to drive but after driving it so much, you get used to it. Feels safe and secure and the features are also nice."
5164, a year ago,5,Very nice midsize sedan. The newer styles are so sleek and sporty and the added features are also a plus. It’s very crazy to see how quickly the body of these cars changed in just a few years but the change was for the better. Great car!
5165, a year ago,5,"Nice compact car. This was actually my first car that my parents purchased for me when I left to go to college. Being in a big new city was scary and the thought of having to drive alone somewhere I’ve never ventured before also scared me! Having this car made things so much easier. It’s easy to drive and more compact making it so much easier to park as well. This car is great on gas. Now that I have moved onto my Lexus, I still own this car. My husband now uses it as his commuter and it still runs so smooth now. Toyota is a great and reliable brand."

It’s just too bad they don’t sell them in the US anymore because I’d buy another one. The only thing I would have changed on my car is the plastic they use for the dash and such. It gets scratched up too easily. Other than that , it runs like a champ !"

5246, a year ago,4,"It is a good brand of car. It is comfortable to ride in. There is plenty of room in the front, back, and trunk. Because of all the room it is a big car. Parking can be a slight problem trying to fit in a parking space. Specially when the car next to you is on the line."

5273, a year ago,5,"I needed a car with AWD that could handle well in deep snow and that was relatively powerful and sporty, I am happy to say that this car met both expectations. It is surprisingly powerful in Sport Mode without sacrificing handling in snow conditions. The model I went with is the XSE Hybrid"

5299, a year ago,3,We had this as a pull car for  2 months I must say I’m impressed. Just didn’t like that to play the radio you always need to press ok on the touch screen that was just not cool.
5300, a year ago,3,Saves patrol and easy a cool car just didn’t like being mistaken for an Uber. Love how specious it is.

5306, a year ago,5,"Bruh, a Toyota Camry is one of the top most durable cars EVER made. This is the perfect graduation or birthday gift for your young driver. As they continue to come out with new models, more and more innovations allow the Camry to rank high as one of the best vehicles all-around. There are FOUR Toyota Camry's in my family! We love and swear by this car!"
5307, a year ago,4,"It is a very comfortable and modern car, I love big cars and this is a clear example, I never heard any complaints from the driver about the car, it did not have any fault but I cannot give you a better recommendation because I do not drive it. but you will attract all eyes,"
5308, a year ago,5,"My first car was a 1995 Toyota Corolla, and it lasted a LONG time! These cars are definitely made to last. I’ve also driven newer models, and they are the same reliable car with the safety and tech features you’d expect from a newer vehicle. I don’t currently own a car since I was living abroad for the past year, but I would definitely consider purchasing a Corolla again."
5309, a year ago,5,I love this car!! We just put purchased it and it is a great addition to the family.
5310, a year ago,5,I love my Corolla! As long as I keep up on maintenance I haven't had any major problems with it. I would buy it again.n
5311,a year ago,4,"I had a Toyota Corolla before having kids and loved it! I only got rid of it because I needed more space and replaced it with a minivan, but it was a fabulous car for us when we were 2 people and  Toyota Corolla even when we were a family of 3!"
5312, a year ago,5,best fuel efficient and high mileage than any other car. low purchase cost. durable.  very low maintenance cost. 
5313, a year ago,5,"I love my Toyota, I have had it for over 4 years now and it's so reliable. If I need to get something fixed it is usually fairly priced :) I am sticking to Toyotas. "
5314, a year ago,4,It is a good car and really fast. But it has a bad antenna for radio and my cd player doesn’t work anymore.
5315, a year ago,5,"A great car for the whole family, it has a lot of space for carrying stuff! By far I have not had any problems with my car"
5316, a year ago,4,"It’s a nice car, not my favourite as it doesn’t have amazing features. But the car lasts a long time and drives well with no problems."
5317, a year ago,5,I owned a 2003 Toyota Corolla Sport and I loved it! It was the best car. Great gas mileage. Very rarely had to do maintenance and it could fit in small parking spots. It was also very stylish with the sport package. Very safe and trustworthy car!
5318, a year ago,5,"Love my car. Its small, modern and reliable. Have had my car for several years now with only minor faults. Love it would definatly buy another Toyota"
5319,a year ago,4,My family is a Toyota family. I've only driven Toyota and when I had my first accident it wasn't bad because the car was built to protect
5320, a year ago,5,"I have owned two Toyota Camrys in the past. Both were my favorite cars to own and drive. The level of safety in the Camry is unlike other vehicles. Both vehicles were running well near or at 200,000 miles. There was maintenance but the cars themselves operated without issue. Both cars were totaled over a decade apart (only way id gove up my Camry I guess). The fact that the car is designed for the front end to collapse rather than push back into the passenger compartment is a major safety plus. The comfort and room in the passenger compartment, whether it was an XLE or SE (slightly smaller but still roomy), was a plus too. Not feeling like you are crammed in the vehicle. The trunk is more spacious than it looks as well, holding far more than it appears to. I'm currently in the process of looking for my third Camry."
5321, a year ago,4,"I had a 2007 Gold 2007 Toyota Corolla. It was dependable, good on gas, easy to drive. It had plenty of room for a family with two kids. It was a affordable car to own."
5322, a year ago,4,"It’s a amazing car, good for families and so comfy to long travels, the only bad thimg is the remdiment"
5323, a year ago,1,Es un auto de personas solteras con grandes expectativas para pasar el tiempo de la mejor manera posible
5324, a year ago,3,"Excellent vehicle. Peppy with the 2.0 motor.  Much improved exterior 
styling. Doesn’t have the terrible cvt drone like other cars.  Well 
worth the money. Love the fit and finish of Toyota vehicles. "
5325,a year ago,4,"Comfortable, safe and stable in walking. Few failures with time and use. It is not as luxurious as I would like, they do not have hundreds of extra large, nor large trunks."
5326, a year ago,5,My mom loves the Corolla that I had but doesn’t like cars and wanted an SUV. We have had such good luck with Toyota that my mom bought a highlander that was a gas saver or ECO friendly and it was the first car I’ve been in where the engine goes idol when stopped at a light or stop sign and I think that it is pretty impressive.
5327, a year ago,5,This was my very first car I ever owned. Not only my first car but I loved it so much I bought another one right after my first one. These Corollas get amazing gas mileage and at the time being in college being able to drive from Oklahoma to Iowa on one tank of gas was amazing.
5328, a year ago,4,"This is a newer version of the one my mom and dad bought back in the early 2000s. Seats were leather so on hot days my sweaty thighs would slip and slide because of the moisture. Air conditioning was great except for when you get to the back it barely hit you. Roomy vehicle, very sleek in all black, and gas is a lot for this car but lasts a while. Overall it was a good car, people stole our car part and was expensive to replace."
5329, a year ago,2,Too small. Had a ton of problems with mine so I traded it back in pretty quickly. The new ones are a lot nicer though and seem to be more top notch!
5330, a year ago,5,"It's very big and reliable. My dad was able to help me and my siblings move in and out of college several times all in one drive. To be honest we had a lot of furniture like desk and mattresses. Maybe my dad is secretly a very good Tetris player, he was able to fit everything inside the car without putting anything on the ceiling. That is how roomy the car can be"
5331, a year ago,5,"the Camry in my opinion it's not too big and not too small. it might look a little bit more narrow from the outside but is actually quite wide and roomy inside. The drive is very smooth and I've had this car for 8 years already. It got the basic things I really need with a small hint of luxury. For several times, I was able to to use this to ship several big boxes like when I have functions and promotion events, or when I had to transport smaller furniture and items from job to job."
5332, a year ago,5,"En lo mecánico es un carro muy efectivo y muy guerrero, quiero decir que es un carro que se puede movilizar y trasladarse muchos kilometros sin necesidad de que el motor falle o tenga algún problema mecánico durante el traslado, es un carro muy comercial, es decir, que sus repuestos tanto en la parte mecánica como en la parte estética son muy fáciles de conseguir y mucho más accesibles para el dueño del vehículo en la parte económica y En la parte estética, en esto le quiero referir a lo que hace resaltar al vehículo, es que el diseño del auto es muy elegante, es un vehículo que así como se ve elegante y sutil tiene su parte ruda bajo su capo, es un auto familiar, tiene un buen espacio dentro del vehículo, su medidas de seguridad como las bolsas de aire, cinturones, alarmas de prevención... Entre otros son unas de las más confiables de muchos vehículo y en fin este auto tiene mucho que decir solo por su apariencia y tiene que decir mucho más si conoces todo sobre el."
5333, a year ago,5,"I had a 2002 4 runner and it was the best truck i have ever had I had NO problems in the truck in all the years I had it the only thing I changed was the tires which were a bit pricey but to keep the ride the same I paid the 250 per tire, and of course there are break and oil changes!! I would have the truck right now because it was the best fun ride EVER!! and the color was beautiful it was a metallic blue and let me tell you the paint job was flawless as well.  Well I gave it to my teenager to drive and got me another Toyota and she totaled the truck and that is the ONLY reason I dont have it today!!!"
5334, a year ago,5,"Smooth ride and it was a great purchase, I have one with all the bells and whistles I have a limited platinum addition with as and heated seats in the front and back.  The car is very roomy and it has a 4 wheel drive and picks up very quick to say it is a v6.  The best thing about the care is the gas mileage that it gets it is truly the best i have ever seen."
5335, a year ago,5,"This car is my discovery🖤 I’m a girl, a student who works in a not-so-highly paid job, so I need a car that consumes a little bit of fuel that doesn’t spoil the parts 🖤 This model really meets all these points 🥰 All the cars of this brand are amazingly durable. I can't say that the cabin is high quality, but the Toyota is focused on economical storage cars and high quality car parts, which gives the condition of durability. Whats requirements I have at this stage exactly meets this model 🖤 I know for sure that if you have the same requirements, this car will take care of your comfort!"
5336, a year ago,5,I love my Corolla!  I have had 3 Toyotas in the last 10 years.  My Corolla has been great on gas and maintenance.   I  paid it off about 2 years ago and plan on driving it until it won't go any longer.  That is how dependable it has been.  I always tell friends and family that are looking into getting a new car that Toyota's are the best.
5337, a year ago,5,The first car I ever drove was a 2010 Camry and I absolutely loved how it steered! Would definitely recommend it to others
5338, a year ago,5,"I have had my 2018 Prius for 2 years and I love it!! I don’t care if people make fun of me for driving a Prius, but you cannot beat $20 in gas every 2.5 weeks!! Also for those who don’t know, there is a “sport” mode which makes the car go fast really fast!! Helps me a lot when jumping onto the Las Vegas freeways. If you’re looking for a great car, that isn’t overpriced and will save you money on gas, a Prius is your go to. #zeroto60sometime"
5339,a year ago,5,I love this car. It might not be the best looking but it’s surprisingly spacious and comfortable. The gas savings is great and the low maintenance is another perk as long as you maintain the car. I highly recommend at least test driving one
5340, a year ago,5,"Toyota is a brand that will never disappoint you, I like its economy the most, it is a hybrid and it in itself implies an eco car, I like its beautiful design the most, it has no sound at all.  Cars have been here before and drive my favorite Toyota, less than the Toyota Prius shows..."
5341, a year ago,4,"Es el coche en el que aprendí a conducir, es muy económico y no da casi problemas. Perfecto para aquellas personas que quieren viajar sin problemas y con espacio y confort en la conducción"
5342,a year ago,5,You can see that it is a good car and you can also see that it is not very difficult to drive You see a nice car on the outside too
5343,a year ago,5,"me parece que es un carro espectacular, en realidad deseo obtenerlo. Espero con muchas ansias que esta maravillosa app me de esta gran oportunidad de tenerlo. me encanta"
5344, a year ago,5,I got this car while I was pregnant because I wanted something safe for my baby! I have loved every second of my decision to purchase this vehicle.
5345,a year ago,5,I am a car driver and I was lucky enough to attend Toyota Gazoo Racing events and I am a big fan of their products.  I was the first woman to try the Yaris in Argentina.  But my favorite car is the corolla
5346, a year ago,5,"This vehicle is amazing. I’ve owned this car for years. It’s extremely spacious and haven’t had any problems with it so far. It’s a great family car. I definitely recommend this car, best car I’ve owned so far."
5347, a year ago,4,"Love my 2017 Corolla SE. smooth ride, great handling and steering, awesome gas mileage, fast especially with sport mode engaged, good stereo and speakers, super cold A/C, nice safety features, cute sporty body style, large trunk, comfy adjustable seats. I couldn’t have picked a better car. The CVT is so quiet and peppy. I don’t like how it revs up when going up and down hills while on cruise control though. She’s reliable and pretty and I love her lol"
5348, a year ago,4,"Es un lindo auto, excelente diseño, muy atractivo a la vista... Te hará el centro de atención, creo que es una excelente opción de compra... Así que lo recomendaría, es comodo al bolsillo, así que no lo consideraría caro y se que tu tampoco"
5349, a year ago,5,"My all time favorite jeep. It is so durable and classy. I love everything about it. Whether on a smooth road or potholed-roads, it never gave me a chance to complain."
5350, a year ago,4,I’ve driven this type of car quite a bit. It’s good on gas and can accelerate very quickly. The speakers can go pretty loud which is nice and are of decent quality. The ride is fairly smooth but a downside is the car is so light when it is windy you can really feel it pushing on the car. ￼
5351, a year ago,4,The best buying experience is with Toyota. The car is true to value for money in terms of space & comfort. It doesn't look too good but it's ok with comfort and safety. Its maintenance is nearly zero in comparison to another sedan of its segment. The fuel efficiency is not good in its petrol segment which I own.
5352, a year ago,5,I LOVE THIS CAR. It comfy and it drives great. I have the 2019 XLE lunar rock and am obsessed with it.
5353,a year ago,5,I love this car toyota is the best brand all the cars i had been toyota they last long and u can drive anywhere with it
5354, a year ago,4,The Toyota brand is amazing brand which I also use I think I almost around about 4 years that I used the car Toyota Corolla GLI I think this product don't want to improve their rides yes but it is very expensive and not affordable and I highly recommended this car to everyone
5355, a year ago,5,I love this car. I had one years ago. Right now I have the RAV4. But I definitely love driving around in a big SUV like this one. It drove well all the time.￼What I love about it is that it’s reliable and roomy for the entire family
5356, a year ago,5,I am the scar about 15 years ago. I love Toyotas. This car was great. Right now I have a RAV4. But I really recommend purchasing this car if you love a four-door sedan. It’s pretty amazing and it keeps driving and driving. It’s so reliable
5357, a year ago,5,Me encanta conducir. Mi tío tiene este vehículo y me lo presta a veces. Es muy confortable. Para los novatos conduciendo es muy bueno.
5358, a year ago,5,I have a 2018 Camry and this car is loaded with safety features! It lets you know when you’re drifting lanes and too close to the car in front. All my cars have been older so I love the touchscreen dash and backup camera.
5359, a year ago,3,My parents have a highlander.  They have two car seats for my kids. The third row is very small.  I am 5’2” and it is very cramped for me.
5360, a year ago,5,I have a 2020 LXE.  It is awesome!  The ride is so smooth. One complaint is that I tend to drive faster than I mean to because of this.   Tons of features available.  I don’t even know half of the stuff my vehicle can do.  I also don’t like the radar sensor that slows you down when you are in cruise control.  
5361, a year ago,5,I love the Toyota brand and definitely love the 4Runner as well!  Great car and built to last

5460, a year ago,5,"He manejado por más tiempo un Toyota Prius C, me parece una muy buena opción de auto, es espacioso, a pesar de que se ve pequeño, me encanta que es un híbrido, cuando estás en la calle manejando y hay demasiado tráfico y lento es lo ideal para ahorrar combustible, ya que si frenas se recarga, si manejas a una velocidad constante que no pase de 60 km también va cargando su batería, por semana me gastaba mínimo $10 en combustible. Lo único malo es que se nos dañó con el tiempo unas celdas de la batería y no hemos podido repararlo pero anda con combustible. // I have driven a Toyota Prius C longer, I find it a very good choice of car, it is spacious, despite the fact that it looks small, I love that it is a hybrid, when you are on the street driving and there is too much traffic and slow it is the ideal to save fuel, since if you brake it recharges, if you drive at a constant speed that does not exceed 60 km it also charges its battery, per week I spent at least $ 10 on fuel. The only bad thing is that some battery cells have been damaged over time and we have not been able to repair it but it runs on fuel."

5632, a year ago,5,"I liked the highlander because of the ability to fold the seats down so if I’m moving large things I’m never concerned about if something will fit. I liked the ability to control heat/ac for driver, passenger, and the rear. Also having heated seats for driver and passenger is always a plus."
5633, a year ago,5,Love this car. We have the hybrid version and it’s great on gas and mileage. We fuel up much less often and are paying the same as our last car which was a small sedan. Plus there’s more room and the seats are very comfortable. Push start is also awesome.

5639,a year ago,5,"Drove a family Highlander for years and it was excellent. Safe, reliable, big feel. Size wise it is a step up from many SUVs with a third row in the back that can fold down for extra trunk space, super handy to have the option if you need it. Loved it!"
5640,a year ago,5,"We absolutely love our RAV4, especially with a baby in the mix now! Tones of space for all, even with car seat snug and secure, while it doesn't drive like a big vehicle. Great on gas, smooth drive, high safety ratings, and are designed to last a long time!"

5644, a year ago,5,"Had the opportunity to use a Camry when my Tacoma was having body work done.  It's fast, it's smooth, it's easy to park!  Really great on gas!  I loved it!  If you want to buy a sedan,I highly recommend giving it a test drive!"

5651, a year ago,5,"Aluguei este altomóvel no início deste ano e fiquei impressionado. A Toyota se preocupa com todos os detalhes e, para mim, foi uma experiência de primeira classe. Porta-malas grande e espaçoso, condução facilitada pelos vários controles e GPS embutido que entra no carro. Surpreendente!"
5652,a year ago,5,This SUV is very spacious and comfortable. It drives smooth and has some really great safety features.
5653, a year ago,3,"Very small and compact car. Comfy seats, but if all the seats are full for a car ride it gets very cramped up. It's not a bad car though if it's just you or a small family. Buying used it more affordable than new but Toyota is an excellent brand of vehicle."
5654, a year ago,4,It is a good car. Very durable. We have not been easy on ours since we got it and it's still going strong with regular maintenance and the odd repair. I got mine used through finance so in the end it was twice the sticker price. It's a good family car and not horrible on gas. Comfy seats for long rides and ample room for car seats.
5655, a year ago,4,"Realmente es un automóvil muy cómodo, sin embargo le falta algo de espacio, de todas maneras me encanta como  puedo moverme tan rápido de un lado a otro gracias a que es tan liviano y fácil de usar, si es algo caro pero vale la pena, recomendado al 100%"

5659,a year ago,4,"I have had Toyota Yaris for a few months now. I've had a 4WD before this, so it was a big change and I had a scrutinized eye to this car. There were many aspects it had to beat.
And it turned out to be quite great actually. There's a good leg space (my concern since I'm a tall person), driving goes smoothly, sound system is nice and the best thing is it's fueltank. It has a very good mileage. Also, very comfortable for 5 people to sit in.
All in all, I loved the change of having a Yaris although it is not 4WD replaceable and doesn't (obviously) accommodate more than 5 people, it is a great possession and I enjoy having it. Toyota Yaris"

5696, a year ago,4,"As a family of 4 our Rav4 met a majority of our needs. The gas mileage is great for a small SUV and we can go on long road trips without filling up often. I enjoy all of the Toyota safety features including the 'brake' alert and lane assist. The screen is big enough to see everything easily and it's nice that it comes with apple play so your phone can sync easily. I just wish there was a tad more room, as traveling with our golden retriever isn't ideal."
5697, a year ago,5,I recently purchased a Toyota 4Runner and I am in LOVE with everything about it. I like the way that this SUV sits up higher than most and it really drives like a truck opposed to a car. There is plenty of room for my family on road trips including our 50+ lbs. golden retriever. I love how the cupholders have inserts that can be removed so a variety of cups/mugs can fit in them. I have the 2020 which is also equipped with ApplePlay which is just another wonderful perk about the car. 
5698, a year ago,3,This was one of the first cars I had after becoming a parent. While I only had one child it was a fairly easy car to get in and out of. It was challenging to put a carseat down into the car and you had to kind of stretch to put it down in the car. When I became pregnant with my second child I started realizing we were quickly outgrowing the car. There just wasn't enough storage space to travel with one child...let alone two. 
5699, a year ago,4,We have owned our Toyota Sienna for the past 8 years and have loved it. Families debating between an SUV or van go with the van! You really can’t beat the automatic doors. The fact the doors slide so your kids aren’t slamming car doors into other cars and the fact that Toyota’s are very reliable. We have had no major maintenance issues in the last 8 years and we aren’t always the best at routine maintenance.

5714, a year ago,3,It's a good car when we think about a car. I would say that the seats were a little bit uncomfortable but besides that the radio system was great and I had a fun time riding it but if I'm being honest it kind of looked bad from the exterior design

5720,a year ago,3,I have been driving this vehicle for 3 years and it is very good on gas and mileage. I works well during spots mode and I must say its takes time before its next check up.
5721,a year ago,5,The newer models run as smooth as butter. It is not a fancy high end vehicle but it's functions and clean interior  make it feel as though it were. I find it to be a comfortable ride. It has nice features both inside the car and I the engine. It is a decent car based on the engines and all.
5722,a year ago,5,"It's a sturdy car. The price is great on gas. My passengers tell me the seats are fairly comfortable. It is easy to operate as soon as you get accustomed to it. It is a hybrid so it runs on gas and battery giving it the higher mpg of over 50 mpg. I wouldn't overpack the car and avoid putting too much pressure on it, it isn't built like a truck so don't treat it as such."
5723, a year ago,5,"I’m 17 and after getting my g2 driver’s license, this is my first car, a Toyota Corolla 2009, to be honest I love it. My parents bought it for me and it’s great as a first car. I find it’s really really good on gas!"

I do not recommend it for trips, because you can not appreciate the landscapes of the different places that are visited well.

5760, a year ago,4,"It's a good car, perfect for daily use, it's comfortable, and use the fuel use it's pretty good, but in my opinion I have a preference for classic cars.
In terms of price is fine, not that expensive, and you get a really good car. Camrys seems more lasting than other models."

5762, a year ago,5,"Great quality, smooth driving and is somewhat pretty good for gas and mileage. I think this car is pretty luxurious and spacious. There's extra seats in the back row that you can put down or pull up for additional passengers. The car carries a total of 7 people."

5768, a year ago,3,"I have a 2011 camry, i bought it at a dealership im cash for 9 or 10k and didn't notice the trunk sometimes gets stuck. Since it is 2011, i would say it looks and drives great! The trunk space is awesome when it works. Although the breaks feel heavy it makes me feel safe. I feel this when I hit the gas and breaks it sometimes comes to a hard halt."
5769, a year ago,5,"My first car was a Toyota Corolla, and I loved it, but when it came time to get a new car after ten years, I wanted more horsepower. The 2.0 engine is awesome! I love the way they made it so that I can still get off red lights or in an out of traffic quickly. I love the feel of the Corolla. Also, this car handles like a dream. It takes curves and corners very well (MUCH improvement over my last Corolla). I do wish they would improve the graphics on the view screen. They are kind of bland which is weird because the backup camera is awesome and has super bright colors. I feel like this new generation looks so much better than the past, but it still has everything that makes Corollas amazing. I recommend the upgrade to push button start and leather wrapped steering wheel."
5770, a year ago,4,"It is very relaxing, the seats are very comfortable when you sit in them. Overall it's a nice car, I love it ."
5771,a year ago,3,"I was in the car with a lot of people and it was very crammed. I didn't like the smell of the seats either. However, the air conditioning was good, sonce we had just cone from a very hot place, but i still can't get the fact that it was so crammed out of my head."

5802, a year ago,5,"I love my 2017 Toyota 4Runner. It's perfect for my dogs and kids, it has a hidden 3rd row which is very convenient. Lots of trunk space, and the seats fold down without a problem. This is my daily driver and has been for 3 years without a single mechanical Toyota 4Runner  issue!"
5803, a year ago,4,"Toyota Corolla 2017 was my first car. I really like that lane departure and other features are now basic safety features in all Toyota cars and I really liked that about it. I did not like the steering. It was pretty sensitive, if driving and there’s a stone or something in the road, the chances of it swerving off was high."
5804, a year ago,5,It is a wonderful car; spacious and gives great mileage. It is a comfortable good performing car for everyday driving. Once you drive it for a while the gas mileage will make you forget whatever other issues you have with the car.
5805, a year ago,5,"Love 4runners. This will be my next car I purchase, they are great size for a smaller family. They have a 3rd row but trunk size isn’t as big with it in. They are fairly reasonable can get pricey if you get all the upgrades."

5810, a year ago,5,My parents have always driven Camrys and they are awesome cars. Extremely dependable and they hold their value far better than most vehicles. The newer models have so many options. I’d recommend a Camry to anyone.
5811, a year ago,5,I have. 2003 hylander and that baby still runs smooth. gas pedal only needs a little bit of pressure but that is also kind of a con. Speakers of course need to be updated but the cd player and tape player work just as good. A part from that the car is a dream.

5813, a year ago,4,I really like the products colour and thr matching inside its very good for a relaxing driving but ots not that much fadt as other cars this could be improved uf they added more speed to it i think its a bit expensive i would recommend if u like driving slowly

5815,a year ago,5,"Toyota Sienna 
I love my van! It turns on a dime, the doors open with a push of a button, I can haul anything a pickup could!!! The kids enjoy the DVD system and another bonus is they can't reach each other to fight in the roomy captain seats. It is FWD and we get lots of snow in Montana, but with really good all season tires I have no problem getting around!!"
5816,a year ago,3,"Toyota is the most fuel efficient brand the world has seen, its durable, easy to fix, easy to maintain and overall a good , a great car. I would get it"
5817, a year ago,5,"The first, I don't need the size of a minivan, but it has to be roomy enough for four adults to sit comfortably. For example, Aqua, which also is a hybrid car, is too cramped. Especially at the rear seat, Passengers almost hit their heads with C pillar. Fit hybrid was narrow, too.
Next is fuel efficiency. It is over 30km/l with JC08mode. There are some cars that are not hybrid but do over 30km/l (Like Alto which is a kei-car), but they are too cramped, so they dropped from my list. Of course minivans cannot achieve that fuel consumption. I understand I cannot get the fuel consumption of JCmode all the time, but I think it can be useful information. FYI, this has done 33.4km/l calculating with full tank, and it normally does 20-25km/l for daily uses.
I didn't go for electric cars as I thought I have to think where I can charge it constantly. I found I was right when I tried Leaf for a week as a tester.
When I only think about fuel efficiency, Aqua is good but it is too cramped. When you seek roominess, minivan would be an idea but they are not good in terms of fuel efficiency. If you see high-end feel, Crown or Lexus hybrid can be good choices but their fuel efficiency are not so good. So as I wrote in the title, Prius is the car that satisfies all the demands in good balance.
New Prius has a bad design, so I am not getting it. The fuel efficiency seems better, though. I am very satisfied, so I will keep driving 30 Prius."
5818, a year ago,5,"Amazing experience when it comes to performance on and off the road with luxury in mind it's a perfect family SUV giving him what he ""needs"" and the safety and comfort you both are looking for.  Can be on the pricey side of other SUV's but they do hold their retail value."

5839,2 years ago,3,"The 2019 that I drove was a nice smooth ride, with great features! But mom of 2 kids, wasn't the best for space in the back seat with their car seats. Trunk was roomy. But wouldn't recommend it if you have a big bulky stroller, you'd have no space for anything else. I would recommend it for someone with older kids/no kids. Overall, still a great car."
5840, 2 years ago,3,"Very basic car, no air conditioning in the one I drove, so not a huge fan. It was a very affordable car though, I would definitely recommend this car to new drivers."

Its super comfortable to sit in , efficient for families , you can ride it smoothly and fuel lasts for good amount of time (up to 3 weeks even if you go out everyday)! 
The only flaw would be the fact that the older models are quite low so it could get scratched easily but the newer models are higher and sporty 👍👍👍👍"

I appreciate that the seats fold all the way down for loading things like my bike inside. The drive is great. I like the face the back window goes down. I see a lot of other SUVs  don’t have that feature. I also live for the “party mode” feature for the stereo system. The 4Wheel drive is easy to engage and disengage which is great. I definitely use it in the brutal winters of the north east.  I could go on and in about my SUV but , until you go test drive and purchase one you won’t understand.  I plan on riding this one until it can’t go anymore and will purchase another one when that time comes."

It's really gas efficient, big enough for my needs (two people), small enough so it can fit in a lot of parking spaces in the city. I wasn't sure if I really need it, but now I really think it was worth buying.

Update: To raise driver’s seat there is a “pump” (lever you need to pull multiple times). If two people drive the car adjusting the seat over and over again is really annoying."

6008, 2 years ago,5,"Love this car! I had a BMW for years but when it bit the dust, I wanted something roomier. I had heard great things about Toyota so I settled on the Rav4. It drives well, is super spacious and affordable and way cheaper to maintain lol. No regrets and love that I can go from the beach to the mall to the mountains no problem!"
6009,2 years ago,5,"Es un buen carro y muy seguro para viajar. No tiene gran comodidad en su interior pero es muy duradero en el motor y carrocería. Le mejoraría sus asientos que son muy duros.
It is a good car and very safe to travel.  It does not have great comfort inside but it is very durable in the engine and body.  It would improve your seats which are very hard."

6014, 2 years ago,3,My husband owns a 2001 Toyota Camry. It has been a great car despite being older and has held up better than some of the newer cars he has owned in the past. The gas mileage is horrible. And takes more to fill up than my larger Jeep.
6015, 2 years ago,4,It’s a fine vehicle. Perhaps a bit overpriced for what it is but it handles well in the snow and has great safety features.
6016,2 years ago,5,"Compacto, económico, buen diseño. El auto de uso diario para ir a trabajar o para viajes de corta distancia. Es seguro y eficaz"
6017, 2 years ago,5,"In its class and price there is a pretty good choice, it is eco friendly because the exhaust level is quite low while consuming quite a bit of fuel at the same time. The cabin is quite comfortable and walks smoothly."
6018, 2 years ago,5,"Best car I've ever driven. In fact, when my husband, unfortunately, totaled our Scion in the snows of Ohio (and everyone emerged safely), I went out and got the exact same model and still drive it today. They are fuel-efficient, safe, and have run for so long that now my older sons are asking to drive mine!"
6019,2 years ago,5,"I really believe in Toyota. I have had two corollas go over 200,000 miles and this current one seems to jab no signs of slowing down. Great car inside and out."
6020, 2 years ago,4,"It is nice having a big car especially with how often I move. I can put the seats in the back down to make room for boxes and furniture. The car is now over 15 years old and still has no major problems that are concerning. The automatic door did break and now I can't open or shut it, but that happened recently and it is fixable. Overall very reliable car."

6022,2 years ago,4,"I have a 2019 Toyota RAV4 Le 
It is the best car to get if u talk about the safety and awd system also in the low model.
But yes you would somehow regret you have a Le Awd while there is a XLE for some prize added. But is a really great car and possible to take anywhere no matter if there are rocks and mud on the way. In my 2019 you can hear most engine noise since noise dampening is minimal.
                     (This car needs extra 2 cylinders)"
6023, 2 years ago,5,"I love my prius, best purchase I’ve ever made! Gas mileage, goes without saying, is the biggest plus of this car - at times up to 60 mpg! I bought it lightly used and so the price was definitely worth it given the low gas cost!"
6024, 2 years ago,5,This car is amazing. So easy to navigate and easy to drive. I love the windows. I wish the seats were heated as the Chicago winter is freezing but its still a great quality car for any price range. It's super affordable and highly recommended.

6027, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota is an iconic brand with very dependable engines ! Unlike its competitors, Toyota is constantly Innovating￼ new vehicles with new and fresh aspects.

6030, 2 years ago,5,My first car was a 91 Toyota Corolla and man do I miss it! The thing was a death trap with lap belts you have to pull across then an additional shoulder belt to clamp in. The best part of the car was there weren’t any airbags so driving the car made you feel invincible! One great thing about older cars like this is that everything is really easy to work on and take a part to fix yourself!

6057,2 years ago,3,"This kind of car is actually not my type. The pro is that this car is smaller than a normal car so its more easier to find a parking place in difficult situations. On the other hand, the gear shift is awful, it moves very hard from 1 to 2 or else. This is the reason why i gave this 3 star out of 5."

6059, 2 years ago,5,In my opinion Toyota price quality ratio is 5:1 this company manages to produce top quality automobiles which are still somehow modest. I feel absolute earthly security whenever I sit in it. This model will definitely be my  n1 choice when I decide to get my vehicle 🚗 👌🏻
6060, 2 years ago,5,I own this car and I love it!! I love the convenience of a small car because you save on mileage and can literally park in the smallest parking spots most cars can’t fit into. It’s an oldie but it has so much sentimental value that I do not want to sell!
6061, 2 years ago,4,My stepmom had one and I loved driving it. Tons of room and my favorite feature is that it would tell you how many miles left you had in gas.

I summary,ni would say it is fairly good car."
6068,2 years ago,5,"I am a Toyota girl, a true fan for a car that runs forever.  The cons is never to lease a vehicle if you plan to purchase it.  It is not worth the hassle. I learned to purchase what you want in the beginning to save on the end.  Toyota is a company that you can not go wrong with"
6069, 2 years ago,5,"My first car was a Toyota Prius (2006), and I miss that car still. It had such a cute shape (the new ones aren't shaped as nicely), it was majorly roomy inside (especially the trunk!), and that gas mileage was UNBEATABLE! Obviously not the best in snowy/hilly conditions, but was fine for the location I was in at the time."

I’ve always been a sports car kinda girl so I get that vibe but it’s way more roomier than any other 2 door out there! It’s got a touchscreen radio with bluetooth & phone capabilities! It can also switch into sports mode which allows you to use the paddle shifters behind the steering wheel! And of course my favorite part of all is my moon roof!! I couldn’t imagine myself driving anything else 🥰

The fuel economy is very good and quite affordable too. I recommend it for you who want something simple, beautiful and affordable."
6101, 2 years ago,5,"One of the best minivans that play with the Chrysler Pacifica and Honda Odyssey. So dependable that you’ll go 300k miles plus and the only things breaking are wear parts that are expected to break. Easy to drive as a minivan should, with confidence-inducing maneuverability. Interior design is well thought-out, and a touch stylish with some asymmetry. A good decision for minivans."
6102, 2 years ago,4,"A very vanilla SUV, which Toyota is very good at doing now. It drives and parks well, and standard safety features that are on par with the competition mean you’re not lacking...and you’ll be able to park it just fine."

6116,2 years ago,5,"My first car was a Toyota Corolla that was approximately 15 years old at the time that I began driving it. Although it was not the smoothest ride, it was still a great car. My husband and I traveled 4 hours to and from college to home for several years for holidays, breaks, and weekend visits. It did have issues that we had to fix, but the parts were not too expensive and it was always able to be resolved unlike many vehicles that cost several thousands for what should be a ""simple fix."""

6136, 2 years ago,5,"very comfortable, has great stability on the track!  I believe it is a car more for the city and long trips!  I know people who own and always recommend because they never give the problem,"
6137, 2 years ago,4,A good and cute car the only thing is that it does fall apart easily but nothing I can’t handle
6138, 2 years ago,5,V6 but in a compact car. It drives great and has luxury features without the high price. I would definitely buy another Toyota.
6139, 2 years ago,5,"One of the safest and most reliable cars out there. They consistently score high on safety ratings, performance ratings, and longevity ratings. If you want a good safe car to get you around you can't beat a Camry. I would definitely buy one again."
6140, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. It is big but not expensive and it works. The height is great and saves money.
6141, 2 years ago,1,"Toyota for me would be the last option to buy, I have always seen that their safety and comfort do not fit me, they have always been vehicles that even of innovation and entertainment are out of date have been very simple and really this is part of what I am looking for in an innovation vehicle, good entertainment not only for me as a driver but also for the other passengers, without a doubt I prefer another brand, Toyota is not my style nor my option"
6142, 2 years ago,5,"The available sport seats on the SE trim provide great support, even if they seem a bit misplaced. There's nothing outstanding about the ride in the Corolla, but we did find the climate control to be more than sufficient in keeping cabin temps in check. The biggest sound ache is self-inflicted."
6143, 2 years ago,5,"Fancy a bit of pampering? Well, forget the spa and buy yourself a Corolla instead because, along with the VW Golf, it's one of the most comfortable cars in the class. It has softer suspension than, say, the Ford Focus, so it smoothes off the rough edges of road ridges better and fidgets less on patchy sections of motorway.  The trade-off is a little more body bounce along undulating roads than you get in some rivals, but if you enjoy a bit a softer edge then you may consider that a small price to pay. The only thing we'd say is avoid the bigger 18in wheels fitted to the GR Sport and Excel trims; they don't ruin the ride, but certainly add some extra jingle-jangle."
6144, 2 years ago,5,Love my Toyota 4Runner...I have the 2015 version and am obsessed with it. It's perfect for my dog who loves to sit in the trunk and put her head out of the trunk window. Toyota really did a good job when designing this car...there are so many little details that make you question whether you could go back to not having the features. My favorite is how high up the side controls are...it makes it very easy for you to rest your arms on. 
6145, 2 years ago,5,I just got a 2017 Toyota Camry. I needed a dependable vehicle for daily routine. Its the basic model but still nice vehicle. So far no problems. I hear these cars last forever!
6146, 2 years ago,5,"We LOVE our 4 runner. We have had it 2 years now and have not had any issues. I do wish it would have a few more features, but overall we love it. We love being able to roll the back window down, and the air conditioning seats. We love riding higher up and having a large trunk!"
6147, 2 years ago,4,Very economical and comfortable car for daily use. Very affordable to maintain and it’s very reliable. I highly recommend such cars in developing countries for middle class earners.
6148, 2 years ago,5,"This was one of my first big girl purchases and I absolutely loved my little Corolla ! The smooth drive was amazing . The leather seats, my first push and start, the sun roof everything i can ever want at 18 and more 😍"
6149, 2 years ago,5,I don’t own a Toyota Camry but I travel often from AZ to CA and whenever I rent a car I try to find a location that has one. I like these for their reliability as they less frequently need repairs. I feel safe since for the past 5 years they have a safety rating of 5 stars and 4 stars in 2015.
6150, 2 years ago,5,"Reliable car. Have had it for a while, hasn’t been any problems. Mai trance is quite minimal compared to other cars. Great car to have all around, they’ve recently catered to a younger crowd too, so that’s great."
6151, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVE￼￼ my 2019 Toyota RAV4 Premium!! It’s super sporty, easy to drive, and great on gas mileage. It’s big enough for me and if I have passenger, they easily have enough room to be comfortable for a trip."
6152, 2 years ago,5,"My baby is an 03. She's been passed on from my father, to my brother, to my mom, and now me. She pretty reliable and other than needing the regular maintenance that at 15+ year old car needs she agreed been great. The body holds up really well. I've been hit twice, and the car still runs with no issues. Just make sure your keeping the car well tuned."
6153, 2 years ago,5,"Its a great car, my husband loves this brand car. It goes without problem for such a long time. It's a bset buy he ever did"
6154, 2 years ago,4,"This car is nice looking, has a lot of room and is convenient when carting around a lot of things. I don’t have one but my cousin absolutely loves hers"
6155, 2 years ago,5,I love my Toyota Camry. I get great mileage and drives like a dream ! I've hady Camry for 3 years now I'll be buying Toyota in the future
6156, 2 years ago,5,"an amazing car! its easy to drive, goes fast, and is a good price. the price you pay for this car is a toral steal! they last a long time, donf use much gas, and does everything you need it to do"
6157,2 years ago,5,An amazing car never given me trouble and very efficiant . It is also a nice family car and very spacious . The fact that the back seats come down and gets more spacious . Its a safe car aswell .i drive an automatic and fuel efficiancy is good awell
6158, 2 years ago,5,This is basically the corollas older sister. Still reliable but yet a little more roomier.
6159, 2 years ago,5,Honestly. This car has never had any issues and I’ve had it for 8 years. Best reliable car out there.
6160, 2 years ago,4,affordable reliable dynamic low maintenance adaptable versatility lasting brand popular features family car sports and work all around never fails type product long term commitment that pays off in long run among top brands suggested in car sales
6161, 2 years ago,5,I have a 13 scion FRS it is like a little go-cart. It is so much fun to drive. The handling is exceptional. It makes a great daily driver and is good on gas. It is affordable and repairs aren't too expensive
6162,2 years ago,5,Absolutely in love with this car. My bf owns it. I love how fast it can go (no i dont speed lol) . The exterior and interior design is lovely.
6163, 2 years ago,5,"I really like the design of this car, it is very comfortable, I got on some time ago and besides it is very good service."
6164, 2 years ago,5,Loved this car!!! Perfect everyday car and spacious for how tiny it is! The back seats can fold down when it perfect for fitting more items!
6165, 2 years ago,4,I drive my moms bf RAV4 every so often and have never had an issue with it. It drives smoothly
6166, 2 years ago,5,"A good first car to get. It’s a convenient size, safe, standard car that gets the job done. You can’t go wrong with a Corolla. The places you can go with a good tank that’ll last you a while is always a good idea."
6167, 2 years ago,5,"a great everyday and luxury sedan. I love everything about this car. It’s specious, good on gas mileage, safe... etc"
6168,2 years ago,5,I love the Toyota brand and the Camry is a pretty good car. The color selection is great and the drive is very smooth.
6169, 2 years ago,5,Very smooth and comfortable ride. I have always heard that these brand of cars are very dependable and have long span of being problem free. Plus they are aesthetically pleasing as well without breaking the bank.
6170,2 years ago,5,I absolutely love the Toyota brand and their RAV4 was an absolute delight. The size of the car is perfect in the color selection they have is wonderful. The drive is very smooth and I love that the car has a hatchback.
6171, 2 years ago,5,"I drive a 2017 and love this car. The safety features are ideal for highway driving (auto brights, auto sensing cruise control). There is a good amount of highway noise but that's honestly the only complaint I could pull out of this car. It's very efficient, very economical. I would own another."
6172, 2 years ago,5,I loved the car.The colour range is amazing personally I like the royal blue one.A classy interior and a beautiful exterior coupled with an amazing air conditioning system.It is good for officeworkers or for anybody including me who like to look as if we mean business 24/7.
6173, 2 years ago,4,I love my Camry. I wish it had a better screen And would have a GPS. I has bluetooth but the overall quality if the screen is lacking.
6174, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car. Big enough for the whole family(I have 4 kids!) but doesn’t feel like I’m driving a massive beast. Pretty good gas mileage, super smooth ride. Room for all the gear kids always need."
6175,2 years ago,4,"My family is a Toyota family, so I really don't know much difference when it comes to cars. Because I'm used to Toyotas, I have a preference for them."
6176,2 years ago,4,Toyota Corolla is the first and only car that I have owned up until now. My reason for even considering a Toyota Corolla was due to how comfortable I was when driving it. I often drove my sisters Corolla around and definitely liked the sense of comfort and the feeling of easy control I had behind the wheel. 
6177, 2 years ago,5,This car drives very smoothly and it is definitely a reliable car. I will say that the interior does need an upgrade compared to the other cars on the market. Very affordable and very gas efficient. I would recommend this for anyone with a family or needing it for daily use.
6178, 2 years ago,4,"My parents both. drive Highlanders and they ride really nicely! I'm always a passenger because in my opinion, that car is HUGE to drive! However, it's being super useful for moving me in and out of college and is perfect for road trips with lots of room for everyone."
6179, 2 years ago,4,"I have a 2008 Rav4 that started as my Step-Mom's car and was passed to me in college. Let me tell you, this thing is still chugging along! Other than a few battery issues, it's had no problems, and can last many more years. Only downside for me is I'd prefer to have a smaller/shorter car, as the trunk is huge and makes it hard to parallel park."
6180, 2 years ago,4,"My family loved this car. Great on mileage and it went pretty fast for a family van! We loved the sunroof and the the entertainment system. Road trips will never be the same. If you have a family of 6 , 5 or more , for sure get this van"
6181, 2 years ago,3,"Gas guzzler. So, the seats aren’t the most comfortable for a long ride, especially if every seat is filled, and I’m sure I would not purchase this vehicle. Il sure it’s improved over the years, I’ve only been in a model pre 2000"
6182, 2 years ago,5,"My grandfather worked for Ford; I was the girl who was ""not allowed"" to buy foreign. Until my domestic cars crapped out (the last Chrysler didn't even make it 6 months). I bout my 2006 Corolla in 2008 as the 2nd owner and let me tell you; unless money magically becomes no object, I will have a very hard time looking at other brands. What a RELIABLE vehicle!! This car is such a trooper. I got the extended warranty on my certified used Corolla S - highly recommend this - and it's been paid off for years now. The new Corollas are feature-packed and sharp looking for the ""cheapest"" sedan Toyota offers. They might be more expensive off the lot, but are absolutely worth it for longevity and durability.

This photo is from our ""anniversary"" this year, which also happens to be Valentine's day lol"
6183, 2 years ago,5,My parents own a Toyota Highlander and I love it. We have considered getting one as our family is growing. Has plenty of space and good gas mileage.
6184, 2 years ago,5,We love our 2016 Toyota Corolla. Great car and great on gas mileage. It's a small car but we are able to fit two carseats in the back. Comfortable and perfect for mom of two to travel to and from doctor appointments or errands
6185,2 years ago,5,"Generalmente la marca toyota tiene automóviles muy buenos y duraderos como lo son el modelo carolla, con precios magníficos y un excelente diseño, estéticamente son fabulosos y mecánicamente también 100% funcionales y prácticos y de muy buena calidad."
6186, 2 years ago,5,"My Corolla LE 2016 is super reliable, amazing on gas, and I absolutely love that I don’t have to change the oil for 16000 kilometres. It also has a surprisingly big trunk considering that it’s a sedan."
6187, 2 years ago,5,I love it! it is a very smooth and very reliable car. I have the hybrid and it saves on gas so much! I can save around $20 a week on gas thanks to this car. It is also very fast and perfect for long travel distance which I tend to pretty often. It is the best car I've had
6188, 2 years ago,3,Wish it were bigger! I have the 2008. Great reliable car just wish there was more room! Other than that this is a wonderful problem free car! It’s cozy ! Great mileage with gas! It’s always drove very smoothly
6189, 2 years ago,5,"My husband drives Toyota Corolla hatchback it’s small but comfortable car. Cheap traveling because she needs only 4,8 litre in 100 kilometers."
6190, 2 years ago,5,"Would love to own a 4Runner! Great car, very spacious and sits up high. Can be a gas guzzler"
6191, 2 years ago,4,Not a fan of the interior screen set up on top of the dashboard but a VERY spacious vehicle. Smooth drive! Can find great deals but tend to be a little more pricy
6192, 2 years ago,4,"This car is luxurious without a huge price tag. Very smooth to drive. The particular model that I drove has an assist feature that will stop the car if you're too close to anything, which I think is a really neat feature. I think this a great vehicle for someone who likes to look sleek but still be practical."
6193, 2 years ago,5,My mom loves this car and so do i. It has just enough from for a family and it is great for shopping. It is also very safe and has everything you need.
6194, 2 years ago,5,Is a good car I love it and that not to much expensive for me is a good option .
6195,2 years ago,4,"Feels weird when you first start driving a full electric. It's really quiet, and the steering feels loose, which is a huge difference if you've been driving a petrol car all your life. It's a beautifully smooth ride, and lovely to not have to pay for gas as you go. It gets annoying when you're low on battery and dont have time to charge up the car though, and probably not very worth the premium paid upfront if you only do infrequent or short trips each day."
6196, 2 years ago,5,"It’s fast roomy, looks cool, is great on gas mileage, comfortable, nice amenities! Nice sounding speakers! Have had no problems with it. Other than regular maintenance!"
6197, 2 years ago,5,This is the second Prius I have owned. I had an 2005 and now have a 2015. I have two kids and everyone fits comfortably and you cannot beat the gas mileage. I wish the car was a little higher off the ground would be my only complaint.
6198, 2 years ago,5,It’s the most coat effective car that save gas. The ride is quite shaky when fast on the highway but a full tank can take you to a 6 hour ride trip without refilling the tank during the trip. It’s roomy and in the car. Fuel savers would like this!
6199, 2 years ago,5,Very smooth ride and the latest model has many features that assist in driving. The SE one looks very sporty and cool in design. The price ranges from the feature included. SE is the muddle range and good price. I would recommend it because it’s very roomy inside and gives you enough shlter from the sun light.
6200, 2 years ago,5,"I only have good stuff to say about this car... It is nice looking... It is big... It is comfortable... It is good and has good quality... It is fast, easy to drive and has a really great strength... I would recommend anyone to buy this car, it is good if you are single or even if you have a family"
6201, 2 years ago,4,"Toyota’s are known to get the job done. That’s pretty much it... I’ve been in loads of Uber’s in which the ver is a Camry and they’ve all been pretty simple, comfortable and spacious, but lacking luxury."
6202, 2 years ago,5,"Looove my Toyota Corolla! I currently own a 2016 Sports Edition but I used to have a 2003 CE which I owned for over 11 years. It had way over 500k km and all I changed over the years were brake pads, tires and oil. It is such a cute, compact yet spacey, reliable car. It has a low gas consumption and sells at a fair price. Cannot recommend it enough!"
6203, 2 years ago,5,"I love my 6 speed corolla! It’s the perfect size. I don’t like driving large vehicles. Lots of truck space, lots of space for my two kids in the back. Loads of features! Love my sunroof! I’ve owned some sort of Toyota vehicle over the last 14 years and won’t buy anything else!"
6204, 2 years ago,5,I loved my 97 Toyota Camry! Had it since 2011 and it finally died on me in 2019. Well over 200k miles and was very reliable. My next car with be another Toyota Camry for sure.
6205, 2 years ago,5,I love my toyota camry! My car is reliable and I love the way my car looks. If you’re looking for your first cat Toyota’s are the way to go
6206, 2 years ago,5,"My grandparents have been using a Prius since 09 and they are in love with it and I understand why. It is so reliable and the amount you save in gas is phenomenal. Not to mention the safety, alot of people joke about electric cars but seriously this one saved my Grandma's life. She was rear-ended in her Prius by an 18 wheeler and I honestly believe that car saved her life."
6207, 2 years ago,4,This one is a smaller one but if you need an economic car this is the best! It doesn’t spend a lot of gas and it’s easy to park
6208, 2 years ago,5,We are 6 in my family and this is the perfect fit for us! Easy to drive and super soft
6209, 2 years ago,5,"Para mi es la mejor marca de vehículos ya que según pasa el tiempo tú carro  no se devalúa, y cualquiera de sus piezas son fácil de conseguir."
6210, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Toyota RAV4!  I never had a car with so much space and is not only on the front seats, in the back, I have had small picnics with my boyfriend when we go and watch movies outside and it's perfect!"
6211, 2 years ago,5,"Reliable, smooth ride. Has sensors improving safety when driving by adapting cruise control and alerting if lane has been crossed. Mine is currently 3 years old."
6212,2 years ago,5,"I love my 08 highlander. I’ve had it 8 years took it from 60,000 miles to 215,000 miles and has been very reliable"
6213, 2 years ago,4,I got to test drive a brand new Camry when my vehicle was in for the airbag recall. The Camry is very nice and spacious and a great ride. I did not like the lane correct feature. When you would try to change lanes you almost had to fight the steering wheel to get over. I guess it's a good feature for those who drive a lot and might risk falling asleep at the wheel. You can get a Camry at all different price points so it is nice.
6214, 2 years ago,5,I had a 2009 Toyota Matrix XRS which I loved! It was such a fun car to drive and you could zip and zoom all around town in it. I loved having the front and rear spoilers and the alloy wheels. The only thing it did not have was a sunroof. Mine was white with black cloth interior. Even though the interior was black the vehicle never really got overly hot even in the summer. This is a great car for anybody. Even though it's smaller it has a lot of room in the cargo space is large. You can fold the back seats down for extra room for transport and I would really suggest this car.
6215, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota is the best choice! ⭐ 🚘
I really like this model in SUVs 🌍 💃 . . . 
It is a hybrid and very good for ecology 🌳🌲🌱🌿🍀🍃🌾
I recommend it to everyone 😎 ⭐ 🤫 . . . 
I would not improve this product 👌. . .  It is not expensive 🙈"
6216, 2 years ago,4,"I love Toyota very much🚗, this particular model is also very economical and most importantly a HYBRID 😊.. 
This is very important for the environment. Visually I don’t like it very much, but I recommend it to everyone if you like the visuals ❤"
6217, 2 years ago,5,Bought this SUV in 2019 and love it. Drives great and has so much space. Love the automatic trunk opening and the captain seats!
6218, 2 years ago,5,"Me encanta esta camioneta, es la ideal ""mama-móvil"". Es una camioneta muy amplia y con mucho espacio, cuenta con mucha tecnología que eso le da un plus, el maletero es muy amplio y aunque parezca un poco pequeña le cabe todo; en mi familia somo 5 y en esa camioneta viajamos a todos lados y cabemos todos de una manera muy cómoda; es una camioneta muy liviana y conforme vas subiendo la velocidad se va haciendo más dura la camioneta, que ayuda a mantener el control en la carretera. "
6219, 2 years ago,4,"My older corolla was great and has lasted years! I love that car, but it has had a few issues and recalls. Overall great car!"
6220, 2 years ago,3,Toyota is a cheaper quality car plastic interior and poor quality paint. There are so many on the road and they all look cheap and they are expensive to maintain for repairs all the ones on the road the paint looks bad chipped faded and the interiors are all Cracked and faded ugly cars.
6221, 2 years ago,5,I love my Camry. I have a 2011 and it never lets me down. It drives very well in the snow. The only problem I ever had was my sunroof was leaking due to clogged drains.
6222, 2 years ago,5,A few of my friends have this car. It is so cool and the perfect size. I love how modern is it but affordable. I would definitely consider purchasing this car in the future.
6223, 2 years ago,5,I love my Toyota Prius! It’s small and cute and environmentally friendly! I love the push to start button and it drives smoothly and quietly. I go a long time in between filling the tank up with gas.
6224, 2 years ago,4,I found this car to drive pretty good but did not sit very comfortably. I have heard that they are also really good and don’t need much maintenance.
6225, 2 years ago,5,I've had my car for over 10 years. It's my baby!  It was a gift from my mom so it holds special meaning to me.  I've driven it from CA to NY. NY to TX and back. NY to ME. Pretty much all over the country.  I haven't had any real problems.  Just normal upkeep and it's good to go.
6226, 2 years ago,4,I have owned a Toyota Camry for a few years now and it’s still in perfect condition. It affordable only wish mine had build in gps. My favorite thing is how long gas lasts with this car.
6227, 2 years ago,5,This was my very first car when I got my license! It’s so cute. Very affordable! Gas saver!
6228,2 years ago,5,"Es una de las mejores modelos, toda mi familia utiliza este modelo, especialmente el Toyota Prado porque nos parece que tiene todo lo que necesitamos y tiene una muy buena pinta, además es súper cómodo y todo está hecho a detalle, en verdad es una de las mejores vagonetas"
6229, 2 years ago,5,Great family car. The Seats are comfortable. Accessories are easy to use and are not super high tech.
6230, 2 years ago,3,Too small for my liking. I’m sure it runs good but I just can’t fit a family of 6 in this car.
6231, 2 years ago,5,Great long distance travel vehicle because it is a hybrid. Did a trip on one of these vehicles a few years ago it qas a 10 hour drive and it was comfortable the whole way.
6232, 2 years ago,5,"I own this vehicle. I’ve had zero issues with it. It is super reliable, it gets great gas mileage and it sits 4 comfortably. We even fit my 3 kids in the back somewhat comfortably. One baby seat, one car seat and a non car seat user."
6233, 2 years ago,5,This is my go to vehicle. I am considering the highlander hybrid as an upgrade qhen we purchase a new car. Very excited about it.
6234, 2 years ago,5,Great family vehicle. Toyota vehicles are super reliable and do not have a lot of issues. I own a toyota corolla and even tho we just had a new baby i don't want to get rid of it because it's so reliable.
6235,2 years ago,4,"Reminds me of a baby hummer, not very good gas mileage,  nut was fun to drive and looks good ,has a decent  amount of room in side for the kids and the dog,  I think they should make a better gas mileage  one and they would probably  sell more.  It's nice for some people,but I'm not a fan"
6236, 2 years ago,5,My husband has this car it’s very easy to use. Very good price and will not take you to the mechanics all the time  like other brands.
6237, 2 years ago,4,"It is one of the best in the hatchback sedan line, good performance, maintenance and parts easily available and at a good price. They are very durable. It has a good price for the excellence of the car, maybe it could go down a little and thus have more competition with cheaper cars that exist in the market. I would always recommend it!!!"
6238, 2 years ago,5,This car is very good on gas. There are a few different types of Prius and I’ve rode in two. They have very Modern cars and the battery lasts a while. Very safe and have very good sensors. I would recommend.
6239, 2 years ago,4,I really love this car. Toyota as a brand has been very reliable and a safe choice for my family. If I were to buy another car I would probably want a Toyota Camry. Really like how it drives and the size is nice.
6240, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota Camry 
I have always loved Toyota. From the old body 80s model to the spacious 90s model and the fancy 2000s models. My old camry had 314,000 miles on it when the transmission finally gave out. This was the Best Car that I ever owned. Extremely cheap on gas and roomy and comfortable for a long trip. The Toyota Camry is The Best Car for families and single people. Recomend Highly!"
6241,2 years ago,3,It gets you from point A to Point B. We have a 2010 limited edition and it’s nothing special it has a sunroof aux heated seats and separate front and rear air condition and heater. It’s a good family vehicle and vacation vehicle.
6242, 2 years ago,5,Este es el carro de mis sueños ósea me muero por tenerlo me encanta lo amo mucho muho
6243, 2 years ago,5,Tengo coomo 6 años seguidos cambiando este carro por año para mi uso lo amo mucho es el mejor carro
6244, 2 years ago,5,Es el mejor caro del mundo su espacio es genial la gasolina le dura un montón lo amo mucho
6245, 2 years ago,4,This is a nice car. Buying foreign is sometimes surprisingly a good thing. I have heard it is a great car
6246,2 years ago,5,This car can accommodate your daily life. It is ideal for a family vacation is really comfortable. It is very comfortable for the whole family

6249, 2 years ago,2,Es un vehículo cómodo y sport! Es amplio por dentro y tiene un baúl grande. No es tan moderno y no es tan económico
6250, 2 years ago,5,Great mid size SUV! We got my mom one last year and it’s perfect! Fits car seats with plenty of room and fold down seats for when shes getting here garden started!
6251, 2 years ago,5,"If you have a need for speed this car races. It doesn't feel like you're speeding at all which is very dangerous but super fun. There are three modes, eco, regular and sport. I love using sport mode on the highway and eco in the city. The only downfall to this car is that it does not have Sirus Xm capablities. It does have apple or android car play!"
6252,2 years ago,5,I love our Sienna!!!! It does very well on gas and is perfect for long road trips! It is so spacious and all the seats recline back. I also love how the back row folds down to give you more space if you need it.
6253,2 years ago,5,I liked the Toyota Camry a lot because it is spacious for a sedan and does well on gas.

6264, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2015 Toyota RAV4 and have had no problems with it. It's a great car. Super comfy, fits car seats in the back. Trunk has great space. Drives smoothly. I like that it sits up high too, so I have a good view when I'm driving. Would definitely buy this car again!"
6265, 2 years ago,5,I love our 2020 Prius. Averaging 50mpg in the city is awesome. It handles great and has a lot of important safety features such as blind spot monitoring and 360 cameras so you can see around you.

6274, 2 years ago,3,"I no longer own my Yaris, but it was a cheap car to buy brand new, and from a manufacturer you can trust. The downside is that it still felt like I was driving a cheap car. It was a bit noisy and definitely didn’t feel smooth on the road. But it was reliable."
6275, 2 years ago,4,"I have a 2009 ToyotaCamry Hybrid. It’s not flashy, but only has 70,000 miles on it and I get 50 mph on the highway. It’s hard to beat that!"

6277,2 years ago,5,A great car that lasts a long time! Made yearly 16 hour drives with ease! The stereo gets loud so you can sing your heart out to those guilty pleasure songs! Seats are very comfortable but would say if you have messy children the seat easliy get dirty!

6282, 2 years ago,5,"My mom owns the Toyota RAV4 2011 and still uses it to this day. It still runs perfectly for the most part and only has had a problem or two, though it has been fixed. I feel like Toyota is one of the best reliable car brands there are, so honestly check their cars out."
6283, 2 years ago,5,"All toyota car are very good reliable car, low maintenance. This one in particularly it a little bigger thatvde corolla, but this one speed faster thatn the corolla for a lot... also this one has a lower back support that isngreat if you have to drive for hours..."

6289, 2 years ago,5,"I loved my Corolla when I had it. I learned to drive manual transmission on this make and model. It was cute and sleek for it's time. The fuel economy was great, but driving a manual transmission got to be disappointing as gridlock became heavier over th years."

6291,2 years ago,5,"I rented one to travel in and I loved it.  The lane assist on the mirrors was great, and the space in the trunk was insane.  It was comfortable and the placement of everything inside made sense, it was easy to drive and operate controls within the car. Nothing was distracting. And did I mention it was comfortable?! Loved this car."
6292, 2 years ago,5,I literally drove this car around everywhere for 5 years and did not have a single problem with it.
6293, 2 years ago,4,My Husband owns this car model. It's extremely reliable and affordable. The truck space has a lot of room.
6294, 2 years ago,3,"This is the most reliable car I have ever owned. It has over 100,000 miles and has rarely been to the mechanics. The trunk space is surprisingly big! I can easily pack for vacation for my family of four."
6295, 2 years ago,5,"The car is very reliable and excellent in winter. Living in Northern Wisconsin the winters can be very harsh and having the 4-wheel drive really makes a huge difference. It gets pretty good gas mileage and maintenance costs are cheap, especially if you can do your own fixes!"
6296, 2 years ago,5,This is my mother in law’s car and it’s super nice in the interior and it’s confortable to carry a family! Super nice and big. And it’s in an affordable price

- hight enough 
- can transport a lot of furniture at one time 
- affordable service 
- nice design  
definitely recommend this vehicle !"
6299,2 years ago,3,It's an ok riding small suv but because it's a suv it makes it a stiff ride.  No blindspots so that is a plus and just ok gas mileage.
6300,2 years ago,5,"The Toyota Corolla is a great car. It’s reliable, economical and moderately stylish. It’s low fuss and doesn’t take much to keep it going. The price is also affordable."
6301, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota Camry is a great family car. My parents had them for many years and when the time came to buy a new car, they would just get the latest Camry. They drive 45min to and from work 5 days a week in all weather conditions, so their vehicles get used a lot. They have never had any trouble with a Camry other than replacing something simple like brake pads. They are a very comfortable ride."
6302, 2 years ago,4,This one is my everyday and everywhere car. Never let me down and it is big and comfortable
6303, 2 years ago,5,Amazing on gas! Never had an issue with my vehicle. Other than regular maintenance it has never been an issue.
6304, 2 years ago,5,"Great, spacious car that is reliable and safe. The perfect family sedan and you always know you can trust Toyota. Very roomy, great leg space in the back for kids or any backseat passenger. Very reliable and you know as long as you keep it up with regular maintenance it will run forever."
6305, 2 years ago,5,Such a good car! Reliable and at a great affordable price. Toyota is a trustworthy company that you know will last you a long time as long as you take care of it and maintain the vehicle. A great smaller sized sedan that still suits all my needs and feels comfortable.
6306, 2 years ago,2,It’s a nice looking car. I don’t own one but one of my friends does. I have driven one before and I will say the thing I really don’t like is that the car has zero pickup
6307, 2 years ago,2,"My husbands aunt has one . I’ve drove it here & there . I was able to make it to San Fran , San Jose & back home"
6308, 2 years ago,3,"No me gustó mucho, casi no tiene espacio para poder viajar lejos, es muy compacto pero si tiene buena seguridad y el modelo es bonito"
6309, 2 years ago,5,Oh man it’s like a budget Range Rover and an environmentally friendly Hummer. A real tank of a vehicle if you ask me! Lots of stuff to customize but it looks really cool on its own anyway. A great car for adventuring!
6310, 2 years ago,5,"SPACIOUS back seat, very comfy. Lots of customization available for the car overall! The colors are great! Bodes well in an accident, oopsies! Drives pretty nice, good mid sized SUV, a great first car."
6311, 2 years ago,5,"Great compromise for someone who wants a sedan but a sedan that actually gets some speed. Real cute car, but not so super if you have kids or something. Looks sleek, drives like a champ, good warranty."
6312, 2 years ago,4,"Even Though It Is A Big Car, It Does Not Require Very Much Money To Fill The Gas Tank. I Love The Interior. Has An Extra Seat You Can Put On And Off For Your Convenience. I Love That It Has Buttons That Open And Close Doors On It's Own. For The Winter Especially, It Is Very Convenient That The Front Seats Have Seat Warmers."
6313, 2 years ago,5,My 2003 Camry is still going strong!! I bought it used and I haven't had any major problems out of the car.
6314, 2 years ago,5,I think the new ones are really cute. My friend said they have great gas mileage and it’s spacious inside
6315, 2 years ago,2,"I drove this as a rental when my car was getting fixed at the shop and it got the job done getting me around. But in terms of driving experience, I’m personally not the biggest fan of the car. I’m used to driving an SUV, so to me, this car felt really bumpy while driving and the drive did not feel smooth at all. Especially in the area I live in, there’s a lot of gravel and potholes. I do still love Toyota as a brand but the Corolla in particular may not be my favorite car model."
6316, 2 years ago,5,I love my 2018 Toyot Tundra with the sun roof and fullback window love the air blasting threw on those hot summer days so spacious and can plow pull or tow anything strong great on gas and quality made interior  compact  easy folding seats my family love every bit of this and it came in Orange my favorite  color!!
6317,2 years ago,5,"Es un producto magnífico ya que tiene muy buen motor y ,tiene bastante velocidad ,lo recomiendo mucho aparte es un automóvil muy práctico que les facilita el uso diario y así poder salir sin ningún problema y saber disfrutar de las salidas ,se recomienda!"
6318, 2 years ago,3,"Ugly, affordable and good at what it does. It's not a pretty ride, or one that you feel particularly good about being a passenger in, but it does get the job done. It works, but that's what really counts."
6319,2 years ago,4,"Muy linda la estetica dinamica pero a la vez elegante , el panel y toda su tecnologia e innovación no dejan mucho de que hablar, el tamaño seria muy bueno para mi, buena velocidad, la justa.. excelente lo recomiendo grandemente, sin palabras la verdad"
6320, 2 years ago,4,The Toyota RAV4 is definitely a cute all around type vehicle perfect for winter weather and a pill driving equipped with 4 x 4 if needed and roomy and spacious great all around vehicle. ￼
6321, 2 years ago,5,Amazing longevity to these cars and great resale value if you take care of them and they tend to drive until they’ve been driven in the ground’￼
6322, 2 years ago,5,"This is the few new car I’ve ever purchased. Bought a 2019 RAV4 Limited in November for my daily 200km commute. It’s absolutely fabulous! So comfy and great audio system. Had a small glitch with the nav system at first but that seems to have sorted itself out through system updates. I’ve had it roughly 6 months and I already have close to 30,000kms on it. Highly recommend this vehicle!! I have zero regrets purchasing this car."
6323, 2 years ago,5,Perfect family car.. and the new electric version makes it even smoother and pollution free to our planet. Love to take my car out daily and it gives good mileage too.
6324, 2 years ago,5,"In just 3 months of owning my new Rav4, I was in an automobile accident. A hit and run to be exact, I was able to catch up to this car after many turns. The rav4 has kept me safe, I love the sensors letting me know if the road is icy. It drives smooth. I'd recommend this as one of the top family vehicles to purchase."
6325, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. It is so comfortable and nice. When car go you haven't feeling. I want this car
6326,2 years ago,4,I love my Toyota Corolla. I have been driving it for 5 years with no issues. The only thing I don't like about Toyota is that the maintenance ans service they provide are ridiculous expensive.
6327, 2 years ago,5,"Drives nice, not a lot of recalls so far and feel safe being in this vehicle. It's smaller, but I'd recommend! Easy to drive and all the controls/buttons are easily accessible. Comparable cost to other cars like it. Would recommend- my in laws love theirs."
6328, 2 years ago,4,"I drove a older Toyota 4Runner from the 1990’s and it was a strong car overall, very slow. The drivers seat ended up breaking. Terrible on gas. Was able to fit a couch in the back. This car does stand out so if you get pulled over the cops will recognize you again."
6329, 2 years ago,5,I love my toyota Rav4. I have the limited 2014 Blizzard Pearl with latte interior. This is pretty gas sufficient and I always feel safe driving in a toyota! It is my second and my mother has had several as well! This car has the luxury feel without the price tag of other brands and is always reliable which is not the case for many other brands. If you want a smaller SUV that has the extra space you need but a car is just too small this is the toyota for you! I have never had a problem with any of my toyotas and I absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a safe reliable vehicle with the touch of luxury! The only con I have is that I went from a sport 4Runner to this Rav4 and it does not have the engine or speed to compare. It takes a bit to speed up and it likes slower speed and it is an adjustment but I have better milage now and I am fully obsessed with this car in every other way!
6330, 2 years ago,4,"The car runs well but every tap ends in permanent damage of some sort. Sounds crazy like I shouldn't be hitting things but parking lots are a battle field and accidents occur. I did have an accident and the car was totaled. 
 And"
6331, 2 years ago,5,I’ve been driving my Prius for three years and I love it. I’ve never had any issues with it and it gets great mileage.
6332, 2 years ago,5,"Had a 06 Scion tC for years. Loved that car, lasted forever with me. Still going from what I’ve heard at over 230,000 miles."
6333, 2 years ago,5,I have a 2003 Toyota Corolla and you may think that it is an old car but honestly I am very happy with my little car. It’s very comfortable and to say it isn’t a recent car it is soo reliable. I haven’t had a single problem with it. My husband is always making sure that everything is alright with it and I can still with this car until it’s last day. ❤️
6334, 2 years ago,5,I love the Camry super sporty and reliable. Will last me several years. Love how Toyota is stepping up the game now in sedans
6335, 2 years ago,5,Toyota cars have always been amazing and reliable. They last several years without a problem
6336, 2 years ago,5,"I am so in love with my 2017 Camry. It’s the perfect size for my lifestyle, and it’s made several cross-country trips with ZERO issues! The gas mileage is amazing (even with my daily city driving) and I find this car to be the best I have owned so far."
6337, 2 years ago,3,All is good but I don't like this car back seats. For me they ar not comfortable. Riding with this car like passenger on back seats isn't very comfortable. But I liked that this car have integrate navigation. Also this car design is exclusive.
6338, 2 years ago,5,"I like the reliability of my Toyota Corolla. I've had it for five years now and so far it has only needed routine maintenance. If I had to choose something to improve, I would say it could be less noisy when going up a hill from a stop. I reccomend this car based on reliability and good fuel mileage."
6339, 2 years ago,5,"I'm a Volkswagen driver so this feels much lighter to drive. But for the price, I like the look, interior design and its functions. Nice sensors all around the car for when anything is close by. Nice cameras. I feel like it'll be very hard to drive cars without these functions now, let's say in case of emergency. Keyless too."
6340, 2 years ago,5,2012 corolla. Takes me everywhere I want. We have done so many road trips!!! By far best car.
6341, 2 years ago,5,"I love it! Runs really smooth. Love the interior design, dashboard looks luxurious and it is wide. Also love how you can switch from sport mode to eco mode. It is a gas saver!! I fill up my tank with 25 dollars!! You can’t beat that!"
6342, 2 years ago,5,We have had this car a number of years and it has ben very reliably we aalways say if we bought another car it would be a Toyota because we have had such a good experience with the one we have now my brother also drives a Toyota.  We don't travel alot mostly just drive it around town  
6343,2 years ago,3,"I would love to have it is very wide and the motor is very good to be able to travel to nearby towns, and the colors that have beautiful I love"
6344, 2 years ago,5,"Perfecto para una chica, es cómodo pequeño, se maneja fácil y lo mejor de todo es que es más fácil para aparcar el coche 😍😍😍❤️ suave y una experiencia formidable/Perfect for a girl, it is comfortable small, it handles easy and best of all is that it is easier to park the car 😍😍😍❤️ smooth and a formidable experience"
6345, 2 years ago,5,I absolutely love my car! I have had it for a few years and it is reliable and it is the perfect size for me. We don’t have kids but we have three dogs so it seems to be the perfect size for me. I absolutely recommend. It gets good gas mileage and it is easy to park as well
6346, 2 years ago,5,Amazing gas saver has a lot of get up and go. Her name is White Rabbit or Bunny for short. I can usally fill her up from empty with like 25 dollars whe the prices of gas was high. With the lower prices she taps out at about 15 to 17 dollars!
6347, 2 years ago,5,My Yaris is from 2008 and it’s been the most loyal car honestly! It such a good car and wouldn’t change it for anything.. just maybe a new one but a yaris FOR SURE
6348,2 years ago,5,A good family car with lots of room for passengers or hauling cargo. I like how reliable this car is.
6349,2 years ago,5,"A great car to cover all your basic needs. It’s small and easy to park, gets great gas mileage, and is reliable."
6350,2 years ago,5,I love this car. I’ve had it for years and plan to get another after this one. It can carry large cargo but is small enough to easily park in the city.
6351,2 years ago,4,"Great safe car for any first time driver.  Recommend for individuals trying to save money, resonable priced when purchasing. Also, great gets great mileage for going to school, work, or out with friends!"
6352, 2 years ago,3,Your run of the mill sedan. Nothing super impressive but had what I needed and did a good job driving around.
6353, 2 years ago,5,"I had a scion XB and it was the greatest car I've ever owned. I had it for 10 years, and it never broke down, and other than usual maintenance, it never had any problems. Very spacious and comfortable!! I really miss that car!!"
6354, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my car. It is super cute, compact, and has great mileage. I love taking it on road trips with my friends . It is the perfect car for someone who doesn't have a family yet. There isnt a ton of space but for a single person or a couple it is perfect!"
6355, 2 years ago,4,"It is a good car, it is not my style, but I must admit that when I try it it is quite comfortable, I really like the chairs, they are comfortable, spacious and elegant. I love that it is very light. I do not like the model but if I consider it is an ideal car for a family, it is comfortable"
6356, 2 years ago,5,"I really love these Celicas. They look so cute and sporty. I think you just feel cute driving it. Of course there’s not a lot of room for a family, which is my number one priority right now.  I would have loved to own one when I was in college though."
6357, 2 years ago,4,"This is a good car, definitely dependable and affordable.  It’s great on gas mileage and would make a great daily driver. However, it is just a LITTLE bit small for my tastes. I have 2 under 2 and a 15 year old- there’s no way our family would fit in this."
6358, 2 years ago,5,"I love the Camrys. They are a really great ride, have a lot of space in the interior and get great gas mileage. They look classy, too. No one ever has to be embarrassed about owning a Camry LOL"
6359, 2 years ago,5,"A good car, I'm not an expert on cars, but it runs good and it's really nice. My friend has one so there's nothing much. "
6360, 2 years ago,5,"It's a really nice car and it's very luxurious. Runs good and nothing wrong with it, just not an expert on cars. "
6361, 2 years ago,3,"I've had this car since 2011 but it hasn't broken down that much. Admitedly, I treat the car really badly. I don't take it to get oil changes and I have never gotten a car wash. Still in working order- after 5 years started making a weird noise that I can't seem to stop no matter what I do. the speaker stopped working. that might be my fault not the car. "
6362,2 years ago,5,Amazing car. I have has for 2 years and it has not failed me yet. Have not had one issue with it. As long as you take care of it. Again amaZing car I would recommend and Toyota Camry to anyone
6363, 2 years ago,4,I have rode and driven one of these. The only thing I did not like about it is that the gas petal is very touchy. I do not know if newer models have improved considering I drove a 2010 Camry. Otherwise I do like this car.
6364, 2 years ago,5,"We drove this car for quite a few years before upgrading to a new one. This car was excellent on gas, very spacious, and required little maintenance."
6365, 2 years ago,5,"this is my current vehicle and i LOVE it. it is great on gas (2014), has a lot of space for passengers, plenty of space in the trunk for groceries or whatever you may need to haul. this is the perfect family car (but i just drive myself)."
6366, 2 years ago,5,"i loved my corolla! i had it for so many years, it even withstood a few car wrecks until it got totaled when a driver who was texting ran into me. gas mileage was excellent as well. another plus was the amount of space i had"
6367, 2 years ago,4,"It’s a little low for me, you can feel every bump on the road and definitely not good In the snow. It’s definitely nice but not practical but if you live in a sunny state then this is cute as a first car."
6368, 2 years ago,5,"I love my toyota! My car is soo sleek looking and has everything I wanted in a car - touch screen radio/gps, leather seats, and a sun roof. The car is also so good on gas, I drove from Chicago to Cinci and never had to stop to fill up my tank which was awesome"
6369, 2 years ago,5,Amazing car! Great gas mileage. Easy to zip in and out of traffic. Drove 750 miles to move across the country and it did amazing.
6370, 2 years ago,4,"My Toyota is great! I have a 2015 Corolla Sport.Its reliable, cost efficient and just an overall safe buy. If I could change anything, I would have added a sunroof, and made it a little quicker in Sport mode. It’s fast, but could be faster when it comes to gaining speed on the highway. "
6371, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. I have had it for 4 years now. It’s so good on gas. I have it in white and I wish I got it in a different color because you can see so much dirt on white but I highly recommend this car!
6372, 2 years ago,3,"Its a cute mini suv. Fun to drive, however I did find there was lots of engine noise coming into the cabin so It kind of took away from the easiness of driving it. I would recommend it, but I would mention my discontent."
6373, 2 years ago,3,"I like the Toyota 4-Runner.  But, they are pricey for what they are.  I had a 2013 Dodge Durango that had an automatic lift gate and auto start and I paid almost half of the price of what the 2016 Toyota 4 Runner is- which didn't come with auto start or an automatic lift gate.  It also takes a while to get up to speed where the Dodge Durango doesn't- Borh 6- Cylinder vehicles."
6374, 2 years ago,5,"It is very good car! It works perfectly. Its colour is amazing. I have got it for 2 years and I have not taken it to the repairing garage. It works perfectly. It is very affordable, because it is not very expensive. I would recommend it to everyone, because it does not need so much petrol. It also works well with cheap petrol and you do not need to fill it with expensive petrol. "
6375, 2 years ago,5,My favorite car. I have been in two accidents in two Toyota’s with two separate pregnancies. Neither my fault but both ended well thanks to Toyota and it’s safety rating
6376, 2 years ago,5,"The Toyota Corolla was my first car. Since then I have also owned a Solaris and another Corolla. The name Toyota is so trusted. Corolla's get great gas mileage, have a smooth ride, are comfortable and stylish and last a long time as a car should."
6377, 2 years ago,3,This  toyota Corolla car is nice comfy car but nothing seems wow in this car it's just like any other car having an airbag. This car should have some features like a budget car has. No it's top model is out of budget rather other models are affordable Toyota Corolla
6378, 2 years ago,3,Persoonlijk vind ik dit niet zo’n mooi model. Qua gebruik vind ik de Toyota Corolla soepel in omgang. Het interieur spreekt mij totaal niet aan.
6379, 2 years ago,5,"The 2012 Toyota corolla was my first car and it was not only comfortable, but safe... I totaled it and was completely fine. I wish I still had it but it I loved that car and I hope she’s doing well at the junkyard!"
6380, 2 years ago,5,This car is good in size according to my family and I really loved the Corolla 2020 because of automatic features.
6381, 2 years ago,5,"Es un carro con una figura muy bonita, no gasta mucha gasolina, tiene buena estabilidad las piezas no son muy costosas y tampoco es caro"
6382, 2 years ago,5,I owned a scion for a couple of years while I was in college. Loved that it was compact and easy to park. Also great on gas! Definitely a good car for a student that's also working and is probably on a budget. It was the first car I bought on my own out of the dealership.
6383, 2 years ago,5,I really love my RAV4 this is my first SUV-ish type car. It has a lot of room and it puts me high above the ground so I feel like I have more visibility. I like it a lot but I don’t think it’s necessarily my style so once my lease is up I will go to a Toyota Camry. ￼
6384, 2 years ago,5,"I loved this car, they are very durable and reliable. This car is very spaces and classic. I have very good memories because this was my first car. My Toyota Camry wasn't a new one, but it sure was durable. "
6385, 2 years ago,5,"I love my RAV4. I have hs this car for over ten years and it’s reliable and holds its own on the road, in all weather and with my two kids. It’s got plenty of storage space and more than enough passenger room. I originally eased but found I truly liked this car and bought it out."
6386, 2 years ago,5,"Great car! Works perfect, always does great for long trips!’               Would recommend to anyone!"
6387,2 years ago,1,I have a 2014 and there has been a recall on the doors which can not be fixed. There was a class action lawsuit to fix the problem but Toyota never has parts to fix it!
6388, 2 years ago,5,"I owned a rav4 for a few years and I loved that thing! Perfect for a first suv or smaller family. I moved across the country and back in just my rav4, no uhaul. I think they're more on the expensive side now, so I'm not sure if it's really worth it now but it's a good vehicle!"
6389, 2 years ago,5,"I owned a camry for a long time, it was my favorite car, they last forever. The only gripe is when they do have something wrong it's not typically an easy fix and gets expensive. Very roomy though, huge trunk, you can really fit a lot in them. I'm a fan of Toyota so yea I would recommend."
6390, 2 years ago,5,New corolla looks surprisingly edgy and young! Competing with the cooler image of Honda?￼ While keeping the #1 reputation on their products.
6391, 2 years ago,4,It's a older model but still works great. It's a gas saver and that's great because I do delivery . When buy my next car it might be a Prius
6392,2 years ago,4,"It is a economic car, it not luxury but feo work it is good, and the price is a economic for buy, for my is a ecomic car,"
6393, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Prius, I will only buy Prius moving forward great on gas and haven’t had any major maintenance issues"
6394,2 years ago,5,I have a 2020 adventure rav 4. I really love it. It gaves me the sensation of being in a jeep but it is so comfortable and looks so expensive at the same time. It is at a very good price. I would really recommend this mode of 2020 rav 4. Im in love with my suv! 
6395, 2 years ago,4,"Toyota is a great family friendly, effective, and budget friendly brand. They make great cars and this car in particular was really nice to enjoy and drive in. The outside exterior also made it different and stand out from the usual Toyota models"
6396, 2 years ago,5,"I use this vehicle everyday to go to work it’s good on gas, drives smooth l, and feel so comfortable in it. Would so recommend!"
6397, 2 years ago,5,My grandma had one of these for years and all it ever had to have done besides oil change was tires and break shoes highly recommend.
6398, 2 years ago,5,"Toyotas are way more dependable and this car is sturdy and i love it. My old car for a brand new car actually had loose wire issues so i brought it to the dealer 4 times for numerous issues. ( getting stuck in park/ drive). Suspension sucks as well, car slips alot. Can barely go over 60 on the highway over few bumps with out noticing slips . So to me corolla s is AWESOME! No slips..great suspension, very comfortable to me and i dont have to worry which is the best peace of mind :)  Toyota Corolla "
6399, 2 years ago,5,"Pleasure to drive. Handles beautifully on the road.
Driving comfort is very important to me and the 2012 Camry is outstanding in that department Previous Camry was 6 cyl. and this one a 4. Do not miss the extra power The 4 cyl.gives me all I want or need.  Toyota Camry "
6400, 2 years ago,5,"Intentaré no llorar. El único carro que ha llegado a ser “mío”, fue bonito mientras duró.  Modelo 2018, excelente calidad, cómodo, fácil de manejar tanto automático como sincrónico, sensación de lujo. Excelente siente de seguridad en caso de accidentes, puede salvar tu vida."
6401, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota es Toyota. Manejo el auto de mis padres una vez por semana para ir practicando mi manejo y este modelo de auto rústico es el preferido por mi papá, cómodo de manejar, no requiere de arreglos constantes en el taller. 5/5"
6402, 2 years ago,5,"I own a 2004 Toyota  Limited 4x4 2 wheel drive with 200 thousand miles back in 2017, it has been the most reliable car i have ownef. I'm not sure if I  would improve anything except the after market brakets. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone."
6403, 2 years ago,5,Love everything about this car the seats are so comfortable that I sometimes fall asleep the only bad thing is it’s a two door so you have to squeeze out the door
6404, 2 years ago,5,i have toyota prius 2011 red car 🚘 i think 💭 this is very economical car and i love it
6405, 2 years ago,5,"Never had one, but my sister loves hers! It’s a 2019. Gas mileage is rough but it’s a rugged car with great space!"
6406, 2 years ago,5,"I’ve had my 2015 corolla for 4 years now! I got it at 2,000 miles in 2016 and I’ve maintained it whenever necessary which has made it last as long as it has without any issues! I’m 4 years in with about 85,000 miles it’s never given me any issues except needing a battery change which makes sense since I got it with its original battery!"
6407, 2 years ago,4,"We got the AWD, and only real reason why I have it a 4 star. It’s my presence to have a smoother ride. Having an AWD of gives it a rougher ride. Of course I know this. But all in all it’s a great vehicle. The essential safety features are on the vehicle like back up camera, keep lane assist, sensors and automatic rain sensor are awesome! Having an in built navigation (gps) with an app is a plus. You don’t need to purchase an navigation package for 2k, so that great. All in all it’s a great buy"
6408, 2 years ago,5,Mines old but it gets the job done.  Gets me from point A to point B.  It is very roomy
6409, 2 years ago,4,It's a cute lil car...my mom and I had the 2001 version! Never got the chance to drive any of the newer models but I would assume it is just as good if not so much better than the one we had
6410, 2 years ago,4,"This 4Runner is perfect for any setting whether it be the beach, dunes, anywhere! It also has a third row of seats! It has roomy trunk space and also nice leather!"
6411, 2 years ago,5,I have a big family so this van has been our go to vehicle. It's amazing and I absolutely love love love this van. My kids love this van as well and I love all the features. It's definitely my favorite compared to the Honda Odyssey. I would highly recommend this van for real!
6412, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love this vehicle! I went from a Nissan Xterra to this vehicle. I loved the Xterra, but the Toyota has much more room and fits my lifestyle. It is rugged, can handle all the dirt roads I take it down as well as the many feet of snow we get every winter, but it also handles very well on the highway. I would like to make a few minor changes to the interior such as allowing more movement with the passenger seat as well as modifying the heat and cool options for the back seat. I will purchase another Toyota product. "
6413, 2 years ago,4,This car had a very smooth drive. very good on gas. i felt very safe when driving around. I would consider purchasing this car as my next car.

6415,2 years ago,5,"I love my new Camry. The new design updates have made the SE version look pretty sleek. I used to drive a Lexus IS200t F-Sport. Although I miss the sportiness and speed of the Lexus, the Camry did a great job of the SE model looking pretty sporty. The curves and body design are beautiful."

6434, 2 years ago,3,"I enjoy Highlanders, but I definitely prefer other models. Visibility and comfortability are great, but the look is very plain and unappealing. I wish the model was 4WD for its size, but it is definitely easy to drive."
6435, 2 years ago,2,"I have a 2019 Toyota Corolla and am incredibly unhappy. I bought it when they came out new. I only got a new car because as an incredibly busy single mom I don't have time for maintenance problems. I also chose a Toyota Corolla because previous year models had been so great. Within the first year I had to get the emergency brake line fixed, my rotors resurfaced, the carpet in my trunk fixed, and it has a transmission problem that I still haven't gotten fixed. "
6436, 2 years ago,5,"Fun to drive little car, not much room if you have luggage and three people traveling.  But handles the snow and cold pretty well."
6437, 2 years ago,5,"My Toyota Corolla is worth the value. It is very inexpensive compared to most vehicles and has had zero issues aside from generic, necessary maintenance needs in seven years of ownership. The gas mileage is amazing and I would recommend a Corolla to anyone!"

6444, 2 years ago,5,At the beginning of 2020 I bought my first car which was the 2020 Corolla. I’ve never been more happy with a purchase in my entire life. This car is everything to me and I would highly recommend this car as a first car to everyone!
6445, 2 years ago,4,Great car with great steering and visibility. Bigger than what I am used to driving but its nice to have the safety and reliability of Toyota. 
6446, 2 years ago,5,LOVEEEEE love LOVEEEE my car. Its a great price and very reliable. Ive had my car for 4 years with absolutely ZERO problems. 
6447, 2 years ago,5,"Love my Camry!  I have always been a fan of Toyotas because of the cost. It may be considered a cheap car but repairing anything in this car is just as ""cheap"" and I will take that any day. Another thing I love is how safe I feel in the car going around sharp curves and having to stop short. I have had a VW in between my two Toyotas and I absolutely HATE those cars forever!"
6448,2 years ago,3,I think this car is pretty comfortable and a foul efficient car too there are no pros and con I think it’s great for the price and it’s pretty affordable and not expensive and I would recommend it for someone buying a new car
6449, 2 years ago,5,I loved my corolla and was stupid to trade it in when I did. It was a great car. Pretty small if you were going to need a car seat but it was a great size pre kids. Drove smooth and was great on gas
6450, 2 years ago,5,I loved my Toyota Camry. It was so reliable and great on gas. Plenty of room for what I needed at the time. If I went back to a car it would definitely be a Camry. Trade in value is decent as well.
6451, 2 years ago,5,"this was the jeep my mom had! hard since 2007 with one of these and it was like love at first sight! Although she wouldn't let me drive her, I loved going out for a walk with her just for getting in the jeep. I have very good and bad memories in these vehicles. It is very safe ... someone who almost went off a cliff on one of them tells you! if I had the chance I would have one of these as fast as possible"
6452, 2 years ago,4,"This vehicle is roomy and comfortable. My sister owns this vehicle and it is our go-to car for long road trips. It is a bit big for my liking because I like smaller SUVs, but overall it's a great SUV! I would definitely recommend for large families."

6462, 2 years ago,5,"Nice comfortable car... ecological..need small amount of petrol, it works very well...parts are not spoiled easily."
6463, 2 years ago,4,Good reliable decent car. It has a good resale value just because it’s one of those cars that will last out forever and keep you safe . It’s also a good family car to have or to pass down to new drivers in the family
6464, 2 years ago,3,"Have had many problems out of this vehicle . I have an ""S"" series so it is fast and so is the take off. Gas mileage good as well.

So many customizable options in the different packages so you have lots to choose. The dogs love the space!
6470,2 years ago,3,It's my mom's. It great because it's spacious for weekend road trips or large family outings. I think its the ultimate family car and you'd never not catch me not sleeping in too. I personally wouldn't get it cause it's too middle-age for me.

6475, 2 years ago,5,I love my Corolla! It is a 1999 and 21 years later it is still running amazing. Toyota is a company that I trust. Toyota is a company that builds products that last through thick and thin. They are an awesome company and make great vehicles!
6476, 2 years ago,5,Great size for a crossover SUV! Tons of storage space in the back for vacations and moving larger objects. Lots of safety features! There are a few blind spots that could be improved upon with more adjusting options on the seats. Definitely would recommend (but still love my Honda more ❤)
6477, 2 years ago,4,Great on gas.  Very smooth driving.  My first car was a Toyota Corolla.  I can't say enough about how much I loved it.  I had well over 200 000 miles and it always ran fine.

6485, 2 years ago,5,"This is also a safe for vehicle. It drove so smoothly oh, I did not want to get in my own vehicle. I also feel that this car is mechanically inclined. The person that owns the vehicle I drove, says they will never get anything other than this Toyota Camry."
6486, 2 years ago,5,Excellent quality car. Long lasting dependable great space inside. My mother has had her highlander since 1989 and it's still running just fine. A little pricey but worth it.

Family car as well as a delight for drivers. If you're looking for a family car, go for this."
6490, 2 years ago,5,My 4 runner is almost an antique and will be passed down to my son. She isn't my daily driver these days but I absolutely love her from the way she looks to the way she drives it was really hard to find something comparable. The only downside was it only had 5 seats and I needed 6.
6491, 2 years ago,5,"My boyfriend had the 1999 Toyota Camry and that car was a trooper! Towards the end it was falling apart but it was passed down to three different owners in his family and had well over 300,000 miles on it. One thing I love about Toyota is they rarely die and they are extremely dependable!"
6492, 2 years ago,5,I love my Toyota FJ Cruiser. It’s the best spacious enough to move. Reliable enough to get you all the way from Florida to California and back!!! Best car ever.
6493, 2 years ago,5,It was good. I love the interior. The machine was lit as well. To be honest it is my dream car so if I am going to buy one definitely it is the Camrey
6494, 2 years ago,5,My parents have a rav4 and they love it. I always enjoy riding in it. Toyota’s are great cars!
6495, 2 years ago,5,We love our 4 runner. There is a lot of room and it’s so reliable. The Only bad thing I will say is that it’s a gas guzzler!
6496, 2 years ago,5,I had a 2019 as a rental. I’m saving money to go buy one! It was SO awesome! I fell in love
6497, 2 years ago,4,Worst car to use on a highway it's too light and you could get smashed so easily if you are up against a bigger car. It's a great budget car to start with and very compact. It picks up speed but I wouldn't recommend for long distances.
6498, 2 years ago,5,I sat in this car in my childhood and I still love it. It's a very unique car with a slightly luxury edge. It used to be huge in the earls 2000s however now it's not seen as much on the roads in comparison to other models.
6499, 2 years ago,5,My dad owned this model since 2002 it served him for well for 10 years!! Comfortable car no major issues and the fact that it survived for years just means the make and quality was incredible and obviously he maintained and treated the car well which is important. The car lacks speed but that's ok if it's a family car.
6500, 2 years ago,5,"The 2020 Toyota Corolla gets great gas mileage, has plenty of driver assistance technology, and earns the best predicted reliability rating in the compact car class. However, it's not as fun to drive as many rivals, and several classmates are more well-rounded"
6501,2 years ago,5,"It was my first new car, got it when i was 21 and kept it for ten years. Never gave me a problem. I  only sold it because i wanted a new car but never broke down Toyota Corolla"
6502, 2 years ago,5,El Toyota que yo tenía era standard y me encantaba porque es un auto muy cómodo y mi familia se sentían cómodos y seguros ahi
6503, 2 years ago,5,I absolutely LOVE my Rav4! At first I didn't think I would like it because it felt like just a mom car. But my goodness was I wrong! So many different modes and customizations! If I ever decide to trade my car... it would just be for a newer model!
6504, 2 years ago,5,"Okay so I have this car and a Corolla it’s a sport I love it so much I love to drive competition, but when I’m not usually driving my husband just drives me around, and I love it like I love the spirit I love everything about sports car only in general. ￼"
6505, 2 years ago,5,"My dad owns a Toyota land cruiser 2020 model, i love its interior and the seating is also good, good legspace. Never got a chance to ride,because of quarantine, looking forward after the lockdown. I love big cars. My Dad loves it."
6506,2 years ago,4,"C'est genre de voiture est parfait pour des sortie en plaine nature , confortable , élégante jaime ce modèle.
En plus de sa elle est très élégante pour être un 4x4"
6507, 2 years ago,3,The car is very small. It was an older model that I drove in. I wouldn't personally choose this as I like suvs but if you need something for 1 person or for a first car it's good
6508, 2 years ago,5,It is a compact car and good for its price. It is not roomy inside. The car’s accelerator is very slow I’ve noticed in many cars. I would improve the windshield view because it seems there are a lot of blind spots. Overall it is reliable and cheap.
6509, 2 years ago,4,"I had a 2005 Camry, so nothing luxurious, but I enjoyed this car. It was decently roomy and a great value for the price. I’ve heard that these cars tend to last a long time and I could see why. They are pretty sturdy. I felt safe driving it.￼"
6510, 2 years ago,5,Toyota was my ride or die car. It was one of my first cars after I got my driving license and I've got to better my driving skills with this car. The design and the entertainment system could be improved but all in all it is an affordable car and such a good mate for beginners.
6511, 2 years ago,5,It was comfy and very cute! Drove very smoothly. Was a bit narrow for my liking though. Nice for like a first car or a small family.
6512, 2 years ago,5,This car is excellent is long lasting and it’s cheaper than other brands. you buy it one and maybe won’t need to change for at least twenty years!
6513,2 years ago,5,I have owned two Rav4s and I absolutely love this car! it’s affordable and reliable and is great on gas!
6514, 2 years ago,5,My 2010 is my longest owned car. I have just over 100k miles. I think I'll be driving it another 10 years. I had to replace the factory stereo 4 times because it was faulty I ended up going with a non-factory stereo from a specialty shop because it had gotten too frustrating. My paint job looks like crap but it's still a great car
6515,2 years ago,5,Sleek smooth and fast look for the hottest girls in the city riding through town in this awsome leather interior custom automatic. Everyone who rides will understand why Toyota is the right car for anyone.
6516, 2 years ago,5,"My baby crazy girl 😄😄 I love this car very, very much because its the most comfortable, visually beautiful and strong  one, compared to other cars, which i had before!"
6517, 2 years ago,4,"I am a Toyota Lover! My first Toy was a '95 4Runner and if it hadn't been for the Tranny, I might still have it now!  It is PRETTY AWESOME in snow, GREAT for looking over traffic. My down is if you have a bad leg/knee, climbing in and hopping out can be a pain in the behind.  My latest drive was a '19 Rav 4!  It is comfortable, decent on gas and nice on the eyes. The driver's seat is ""off-centered"" but after a few road romps, you quickly adjust.  The amenities are nice and I love their infotainment location."
6518, 2 years ago,5,"Amazing car, very practical but useful. I love the interior style and exterior. I have the red corolla, and I love it so much."
6519, 2 years ago,5,This car is great for those who want a SUV type of car. It is spacious and not too big to the point where you cannot drive it. It is affordable and drives well!
6520, 2 years ago,5,Its a very economical car and for new drivers like me its a perfect option for a first car. Parts are easily available. Very comfortable
6521, 2 years ago,5,"This is my student car. I have it for about 6 years now, and this is the only car I NEVER had problem with. Regular oil changes, changed the break last month for the first time, all kind of lights changed, but nothing huge. It cost nothing to full, pieces are easy to find (I have a hatchback, so the pieces are not easy to change yourself because it’s really tight to get in), and everyone is familiar with that mechanics. I also had minor accidents with it (none that was my fault) and despite his small frame, it was solid : I never repaired a bump I had on the frame, and my mechanic said it could rust, but it’s been 4 years and no rust at all. The only thing that would make me change this bad boy one day, is the fact that I live in a nordic country and the snow is really a mess for every car on the road and the small weight of my car isn’t helping. I would change it for a CH-R, but it is still a Toyota."
6522,2 years ago,5,Toyota last forever. My car is salvage and it still loves to run without any issues for me to have to fix. I get amazing gas mileage for driving in the city and for highway. My only issue id my emergency brake light never goes off for some strange reason.
6523, 2 years ago,5,Great on gas!! Comfortable to drive and very efficient. Recommended this vehicle to families!
6524, 2 years ago,4,The gas pedal and brake was a bit choppy when i first got use to it but soon learned to love driving this car.

6526,2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my Toyota Corolla. It is super good on gas, the interior and exterior is super nice. I am currently leasing mine and it is a food price for how nice the car is! It’s also good for someone my age that doesn’t need a lot of space for anything!"
6527, 2 years ago,5,As I use my car every day to run errands and I gave to go downtown is very easy to find parking spaces x
6528, 2 years ago,4,Drive really nice and looks nice from the outside I just feel like there behind on updates inside the rav4.

6530, 2 years ago,5,"It's my girlfriends car but wow very relaxing car easy to drive and sporty all the fancy stuff like seat adjustments seat warmers GPS touch screen. What really gets me is how affordable these cars all the luxury model is 31,000 not bad and very reliable car take care of car car takes care of you!"
6531, 2 years ago,4,I have family members that own Toyota vehicles. My dad has had a Tacoma since 2009. Their service department is great.
6532, 2 years ago,4,My aunt and uncle own this car and have had it for a long time. I drove it a couple of times. There was a recall on the dashboard because it would get sticky out in the heat. They replaced it.
6533, 2 years ago,5,"I own 2016 corolla, I have also owned the 2010 model. There used to be a compartment on the left side just under the steering wheel. I really miss that in my new model. Other that that everything else about the car I love. Amazing mileage."
6534, 2 years ago,2,i hate this car. i mean it is nice and i like the technology but i hate how big it is and honestly hate minivans in general
6535, 2 years ago,5,Surprised that for such a small car how much trunk space there is. This vehicle is comfortable to ride in and drive as well.
6536,2 years ago,5,I have a black Toyota Camry back at home! They are very reliable cars! all of my family cars are Toyota

6538, 2 years ago,5,Nice car! Affordable and it has lasted me for years. It looks nice and a good for a first car. It is spacious for a small car.
6539,2 years ago,4,"It's an efficient car, it's not pretty powerful but it's perfect in size and speed for me. I live in a small town and I don't have to drive big distances, so I think that in my case is a really good option."
6540, 2 years ago,4,I like this car by dad used to have one and it drove great I just didn’t like that it was small
6541, 2 years ago,5,Toyota Camry 95 was the first car I owned and wow. It had 5 owners before me and the car was in great condition!!
6542, 2 years ago,4,Smooth ride with class and style. The sporty camry is the car I love to brag about to others
6543, 2 years ago,4,"Great economic car, great espace and quality, it’s been 5 years we own it. No complaints. Will definitely purchase it and do recommend it."
6544, 2 years ago,5,Very reliable SUV. Just large enough to be roomy and fit what you need. Smooth ride fits passengers quite comfortably. 
6545, 2 years ago,5,"Great, reliable car! Never had an issue with it in the 10 years we have owned it! Bought it brand new, and have only done the needed maintenance things. "
6546, 2 years ago,5,"Otro vehículo que no tiene pérdida, un clásico flduradero que no causa problemas mecánicos que también es económico en el consumo y fácil con las piezas de repuesto."
6547, 2 years ago,5,"El mio fue fit que es versión coreana, pero cómodo y espacioso, económico y nunca me dio problemas. Puede cambiarlo solo por que quería uno mas grande."
6548, 2 years ago,5,It is NOT the car in the photo to be clear but I like it it's older I barely even see scions anymore but mines lasted a long time idk works for me
6549, 2 years ago,5,My mom used to own a hybrid Highlander and it was very reliable. It was very quiet since it was a hybrid.

6552, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my car. I cannot say anything bad about it. It has all the room I need for being a busy mom, but not overly big. The ride is so smooth and comfortable. This is my second Toyota and I'm pretty sure that is all I will drive. I have loved both cars."
6553, 2 years ago,4,"Our Camry is pretty old so it doesn't have the newest settings like a navigational system or a place to play audio from your phone built-on but it works just fine with some additional purchases. Not a huge fan of how you can't see the road too much as it's a little low, but comfortable and fun to drive."
6554, 2 years ago,5,"Really good for offroad driving with very high clearance, low drive mode is very reliable driving downhill you don’t need use brake using low drive mode, 4WD with LSD lock leave impression you can drive on your FJ anywhere you like event if they is no road."
6555, 2 years ago,3,This car was reliable and had great gas mileage. But I was not happy with the backup camera and felt the screen was blurry. It was nice and affordable and i didn't have to spend a lot of money on repairs. I would definitely recommend this car and was pleased with my purchase.
6556, 2 years ago,4,I rented this car for a week and found it to be an easy and reliable car. It got great mileage. The con was that it was very hard to see out the window especially if you are not that tall. Besides that the backup camera was easy to read and the safety features were very nice I highly recommend this car.
6557,2 years ago,5,I love my Rav! It caught my eye as soon as I started car shopping. I love the sleekness of it and the feel of a crossover without too much height loss so it keeps an SUV feel.
6558, 2 years ago,4,"Beautiful car, very spacious and nice. However, the reason for 4 out of 5 stars is due to thinking the sunroof is overkill for how big it is. Where i live we get hail and if that sunroof breaks that's your whole roof and will a lot to replace."
6559, 2 years ago,5,"Esta camioneta es muy bonita , espaciosa y resistente; puedes conducir tanto en ciudad como en el campo; es una todo terreno ; su diseño es muy amplio"
6560, 2 years ago,5,"Este carro me encanta ; lo he conducido por años , si tuviera que cambiar; volvería a comprar un Toyota Yaris, esta edición de la Toyota es muy económico en repuesto y la verdad es muy cómodo"
6561, 2 years ago,5,We have owned three different vehicles Toyota Motor Company and are always pleased. Toyota Camry and Avalon are our family favorites.
6562, 2 years ago,4,The Scion XD is a perfect commuter car. It is a minimalist vehicle but perfect in size allowing any driver to zip in and out of anything. It drives well and is affordable in both ourchase and upkeep. I would recommend it for anyone looking for an economic purchase.
6563, 2 years ago,5,This car was so worth it. It was a great car providing safety and a lot of other features for an affordable price.
6564, 2 years ago,5,"This car has my sister and she is very satified.This vehicle is an affordable mixture of luxury,safety,fuel economy and for those who choose to drive vehicles that are kinder to the environment.My sister enjoys the heated sead,controlling things like incoming calls,musical selection and e.t.c.This car is worth every penny paid entirely due the detail given to both design and functionality.It's great car an gread value.I recommended it <3"
6565,2 years ago,5,"Es una linda opción si te gustan los autos estéticamente cómodos y bonitos, te da una comodidad increíble."
6566, 2 years ago,4,"Toyota corolla was my first car. To be honest I feel a lot safer in the RAV4 SUV. This one would lose control and easy in the winter or when there was strong winds. If you were shopping for a Corolla, I would pay the extra money to get something a little more heavy. If you just need a vehicle to get you from point a to point B then this is really good for it's money￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
6567, 2 years ago,5,"I am absolutely in love with my Toyota RAV4. It is the perfect size, easy to handle, and great on gas￼￼￼￼"

6572, 2 years ago,5,"i love my toyota camry, it has lasted me quite a while and is adorable! (i named her tonya)"
6573, 2 years ago,4,"I have had to drive my sons Toyota Corolla SE a lot and I do like it I'm just use to driving a bigger car which I am much more comfortable in. I do think that Toyota makes great vehicles, they have a solid reputation. The safety features are wonderful and the car is an affordable vehicle. "
6574, 2 years ago,4,"We previously owned a rav-4 and it was very reliable, quite comfortable ride. I would say that it was noisy on the highway but for how little highway driving I did I didn’t mind it too much"
6575, 2 years ago,5,I got the Toyota Camry 2019 in white and oh my goodness I am IN LOVE!! The cons is that the cup holders aren’t met for like drinks rlly.. more like soda cans and water bottles
6576, 2 years ago,5,I love the car it is awesome and it saves a lot of gas. I love everything about the car and I love how well it has been for my family. Absolutely love the car.
6577, 2 years ago,5,I have Toyota car for more than five years and I am very satisfied. Of course it has some issues but in comparison with the other car brands I would say that it's great. Price is very good and quality is perfect. I advised my coworkers to buy Toyota car and they are also very satisfied. So totally recommend
6578, 2 years ago,5,I just got this car two weeks ago after I got in a wreck and totaled my car last month so far it is reliable and good on gas
6579, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car. I find it is the perfect size for me and has all of the features that I want in a car. My one complaint is that it has a very small gas tank and I constantly have to refill it if I am driving a lot. Overall though, it is comfortable and easy to drive."
6580, 2 years ago,5,Loving the body on the new Camry so sporty and luxe. I just wish the inside paneling wasn’t so plastic and that the media system wasn’t that black iridescent plastic that catches every piece of dust and fingerprint.
6581, 2 years ago,5,Love the Camry super comfortable and roomy! Great gas mileage. Sporty looking. All pros no cons for me
6582, 2 years ago,5,"So good on gas it’s crazy. Very reliable and inexpensive to buy, fix and maintain."
6583, 2 years ago,4,Nice size for a small family or new driver good spacious seats comes in a range of colours however small boot/trunk
6584,2 years ago,4,This is my ideal vehicle for feeling safe with the kids and having enough room. It holds its value and has room for everything but it’s unfortunately too expensive for me to justify buying this product.
6585, 2 years ago,5,I absolutely love my 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback. This is my second Corolla. There are plenty of bells and whistles including a large touch screen. Mine is a manual transmission. It is very affordable for what it has to offer. I would highly recommend the Toyota Corolla Hatchback and really any Toyota vehicle.
6586,2 years ago,5,"I’ve had other model of cars,but this is the best ,very little gas usage and since I’m short it feels just right for me."
6587, 2 years ago,5,"This was my first car. I loved it, it was in the best condition and was very reliable. I have never had a problem with that car."

6591, 2 years ago,5,"This is an awesome car, very fun to drive! we've never had a problem with the 4Runner. I normally drive a small car so when I drive this it is very weird. "
6592, 2 years ago,5,"Love this car, but it eats up a lot of gas. It goes really fast and fits the whole family"
6593, 2 years ago,1,"Absolutely hated this vehicle. I got into a heavy car accident, airbags didn’t even deploy. Not very spacious at all!"
6594, 2 years ago,3,"Very spacious - all around, has great features including sound and lasts long ... YEARS!"
6595, 2 years ago,2,"It wasn’t the greatest, with time this vehicle deteriorates in the worst way possible. This model isn’t fuel efficient. Better choice for large families."
6596, 2 years ago,4,"My car is definitely getting old, since it is from 2008!  But it is still going pretty strong.  It sometimes does this weird vibration thing, but besides that there are no other issues.  I love Toyotas because they drive literally forever its crazy."
6597, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Toyota Corolla. This is my first car I have purchased and it is great. The gas mileage is wonderful and so is the interior. I love the sound system, feel of the car, and it’s overall fun/smooth to ride. I would purchase a Toyota again. #Toyota #Car"
6598, 2 years ago,4,Not the cutest cars but it's very good on gas. A bonus for buying the car iis that you're helping out the environment.
6599, 2 years ago,5,"My first car was a Toyota Corolla and it was so sad to finally give it up. I do know it’s still kicking though, and it has over 200,000 miles on it. It was the best car I’ve ever had and Toyota knows how to make quality cars that last."
6600, 2 years ago,4,"I have an old 2001 Toyota Camry, but it still runs beautifully and has lasted longer than any of my friends cars. I would like to upgrade to a newer Toyota though and see their new features!"

6604, 2 years ago,4,"un camión encantador, he montado en él y tiene una comodidad a pesar de que son 3 puertas, desearía tener uno de estos"
6605,2 years ago,4,"Toyota's always been around.They are decent looking cars for everyday life and simple to use.
It's efficient and on the go."
6606, 2 years ago,5,"So far, so good. Had this car for about a year now. Love the features on it, like the big navigation screen and side mirror alerts. Dont really like the sound it makes when it backs up though."
6607, 2 years ago,4,Eto yung unang kotse na binili namin when starting here in the US. 2003 Matrix XR na model. We bought it second hand so okay naman sya since Toyota. Madaming pyesa available at madali gamitin. 
6608, 2 years ago,5,"Have owned a 2014 Corolla LE and currently own a 2018 Corolla SE and let me just say I love both of them. Corollas are extremely efficient at saving gas and especially since the gas is so low now, you can basically fill up the car for only $20. "
6609,2 years ago,5,"Toyota makes great cars and of those cars, the Rav 4 is the best! I love the versatility this car has to offer. It is small enough to feel comfortable in the city but tough enough to go out into nature. This car is reliable and has great gas mileage!"
6610, 2 years ago,5,Great reliable car. Perfect for those family trips or even a day of offroading. Lots of space.
6611, 2 years ago,3,This car was good on gas but it didn't have much room. Its not meant to have many people or too much weight in the vehicle. Some 4 cylinder vehicles perform like 6 cylinder but don't worry it definitely performs like a 4 cylinder lol. My experience at the dealership has never ever been good EVER!
6612, 2 years ago,4,I have a 2010 Toyota Rav4 and love it! It is very comfortable and easy for travel because it stores a lot. I have used my Rav4 to move twice and it was very helpful. I feel safe in this car and would definitely recommend it!
6613, 2 years ago,4,most affordable car brand worldwide if i could say not very comfortable thoucheap service kit great drive
6614,2 years ago,5,"The car that makes you look back, every time you park it. Drives amazing, looks beautiful and put a big smile on your happy face."
6615, 2 years ago,3,It was a decent car. I liked it when I had it. But had a bad experience toward it near the end. But it's a great little car.
6616, 2 years ago,3,I debated the Toyota vs suberu. I chose the toyota because of the color of the interior. I like my car but I am not in love with it. Getting in the back is a hassle. With 2 car seats there doesn't seem like there is enough room. I know the suberu would not have given me more room but I think I would have been happier. Toyota Highlander
6617, 2 years ago,5,It's a fast car. Really comfortable car. It's small so for sleeping it's difficult. Making it bigger.
6618,2 years ago,5,I love this car. Especially for the price it is. Would like more horse power. But love it
6619,2 years ago,5,Boy have they come along way...very nice car all around a great car. Nothing bad to say
6620, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car with all my heart. The music sounds great through Bluetooth connection, and the headlights are bright and make it easy and clear to see even on a dark path at night. There is a sport mode that I can shift into when I need to get more speed on the highway, and there is an amazing safety feature that keeps me in the lane. "
6621, 2 years ago,3,It’s worked for me thus far. I wish it was further off the ground. But it has gotten me through 6 years and I plan to drive it until I can’t anymore
6622, 2 years ago,5,"My father owns this car and it is a favourite, my dad purchased all most all of his cars with Toyota and we have always been satisfied. The only concern is the affordability of this vehicle as I have found that the Toyota Corolla is less expensive and is still a great vehicle. "
6623,2 years ago,5,"I recently bought a brand new 2019 Toyota Highlander XLE and absolutely love everything about it! It’s very reliable, stylish, and comfortable. I highly recommend this car!"
6624, 2 years ago,5,I got this car whenever I turned 16. This is a perfect car if you’re not looking for anything too big

6629, 2 years ago,4,"I have a 2008 Corolla. I like the car, but it doesn't have enough get up and go when I need to drive fast... it takes times to get up to the speed I want to be in. The car price is very reasonable. I have the all cloth affect going on with my seats which are nice versus leather. I like my car and I've had it for 10+ years and I haven't had any problem with the car itself! But you know new tires, maintenance, etc. is not as costly compared to a luxury car brand. "
6630, 2 years ago,4,Are used to love this car so much I like that it's just high enough and it was a really reliable SUV

6633,2 years ago,5,My boyfriend drives a Toyota Camry and it is very nice. The inside has nice wood features and he has Sirius XM radio as well. Camrys have come a long way since the one my parents had in the early 2000s!
6634, 2 years ago,3,"It's a little small, but perfect if you live in the city. If you get a manual, just know that it burns quite a lot of gas when u first start driving it. I bought it new and it was really affordable. Has a good amount of options. Very easy to use and looks cute."
6635, 2 years ago,5,You can’t beat Toyota when it comes to reliability. I’ve had this car for 17 years and it still runs great! I haven’t had to do any maintenance on it other than routine stuff this entire time. It’s compact and fits in tight parking spaces. It zips around and get me where I need to go. I’m thankful that it’s lasted this long!
6636, 2 years ago,5,I love this car because it helps me to save a lot of fuel because it’s a hybrid. I always go to university In this vehicle which is really comfortable as well
6637, 2 years ago,5,I am a dedicated Toyota owner.  I am currently driving my 3rd Toyota and most likely will never switch.  I had a 4-Runner for 8 years and only had one set of new tires put on and occasionally changed the oil...and it ran like a dream.  My Corolla is no different...Toyota’s are just built to last!
6638, 2 years ago,4,"Does exactly what is says it would. It is a perfect, gets me from one place to the next. The only thing I can complain about is the biting point can be a little hard and I have heard this from friends that have the same car, however once you get used to it all is okay. Not badly priced either. "
6639, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota Camry sits near the top of our midsize car rankings. It offers an enjoyable ride, plenty of active safety features, and some of the best fuel economy estimates in the segment. A smallish trunk and noticeable cabin noise
are among its few faults."
6640, 2 years ago,5,"I really like my car. Anyone looking for a family-friendly crossover should have the RAV4 on their shortlist. However, it has one of the highest base prices among compact SUVs. The Honda CR-V is a little more affordable, and it has a roomier cargo bay than nearly every
other class rival. On the other hand, if you have more room in your budget, consider the RAV4 Hybrid. It's incredibly fuel-efficient and has smoother off-the-line acceleration than the regular RAV4. "
6641, 2 years ago,5,Great car! Good size suv fits 7 passengers and runs on a V4 gas tank so very good on gas and they look nice too come in different colors and interior is pretty nice as well might be a little tight and the back trunk may be a little small but other than that good car
6642, 2 years ago,5,I have a 2006 Toyota Corolla. It is a great commuter car. It is really good on Milage.
6643, 2 years ago,5,"Cute car, good on gas. Smaller than I normally like but its gets to point A to point B. Definitely not a family car. Small and good to whip thru traffic."
6644,2 years ago,5,"Its comfortable driving camry, it have plenty safety features, i love driving it its comfortable and enjoyable ride. Easy to use moreover toyota is the best. Camry is definitely worth to buy and ride on it. You will definitely love it i am sure"
6645, 2 years ago,5,"I really miss my yaris. The gas last forever ;).
-----
Extraño mi toyota yaris la gasolina era eterna. Duraba mucho! ;)"
6646, 2 years ago,5,"My brother recently got one after an accident he had in a car I gave him. He hated losing the vehicle I gave him, but he loves his new car now."
6647, 2 years ago,5,It was my very first car and i enjoyed it very much. It is very comfortable and good. Doesn’t have any problems
6648, 2 years ago,4,"These are great cars. Dad always says if you take care of your car, it’ll take care of you. Low maintenance and stylish. Not expensive"
6649, 2 years ago,5,"I own a Hybrid 2019 RAV4 Limited Toyota with some extra add ons like the birds-eye view camera and a panoramic sunroof. I love the new style of the RAV4 and having a hybrid is definitely great. I have to put gas less often than when I had my old Hyundai Elantra. It's also a car that feels like it has some power to it. When I'm accelerating it doesn't take much. The birds-eye view camera definitely helps out my parallel parking. Overall a great car. The only weird thing is that when you connect your phone via Bluetooth and get a call the voice assistance says ""Getting an incoming Kual"" instead of call which is just kind of funny."
6650, 2 years ago,4,"The one i was in was a 2008 and its a good ride, the new RAV4 is something i would look into if i was buying"
6651, 2 years ago,4,Its a decent ride Toyota is a good make its what i would consider a midsize car bigger than the fit but not an suv
6652, 2 years ago,5,"I like the Camry. They are very reliable vehicles and drive smoothly. They have a great MPG and with gas prices lately, it doesn’t take much to fill up the tank. I would recommend the Toyota Camry to any driver starting out."
6653, 2 years ago,5,I love my RAV4! I have a Limited which comes with a navigation system which is my best friend. It’s better than running up the data on my phone trying to travel places.
6654, 2 years ago,3,"It was a nice drive. Coming from driving a Mercedes, I loved how free the steering wheel was but it was a little too bulky for me."
6655, 2 years ago,5,I had this when I lived in Africa (Lagos) and it was great to use when the floods on the Island came and the roads were a mess. I could always depend on my Toyota to keep going and get me home.
6656, 2 years ago,5,This is my current car and I love it. The fuel efficiency blows my mind and it is always so dependable.
6657, 2 years ago,5,I like that it is fuel efficient while giving a 4 wheel drive experience as well. I have owned quite a few Toyota models.
6658,2 years ago,5,"I LOVE my RAV4!! Previous cars were a Ford Fusion and a Hyundai Genesis Coupe. Needed 4 doors and trunk space for my family (married with 2 dogs) so I found a great deal on my RAV4 and purchased it in 2017. Great interior space, outside looks sleek, very affordable for a SUV. Only con is that when the trunk opens up it is a tad low (it doesn’t raise much higher than the roofline) so my husband hits his head a lot during load/unload (he is 5’11”)"
6659, 2 years ago,5,it is so comfortable car.i like it.also it is so economical and it doesn't need a lot of fuel.everyone like it.
6660, 2 years ago,4,"I love my prius. It was a second-hand from my parents but it is the most reliable car ever. It's so nice and compact, however I do feel like the blind spots can be big sometimes. It is pretty affordable and its doing our environment some good. If you can, I would say buy a prius."
6661, 2 years ago,5,"No he manejado uno pero es un vehículo muy espacioso y cómodo, definitivamente estaría en mi lista"
6662, 2 years ago,5,I love my car it saves gas and it’s my first car I ever purchased I have had it for 3 years
6663, 2 years ago,5,Super reliable first car for a young driver. I have a basic version but it’s all I need at the end of the day.
6664, 2 years ago,5,"Love toyota camry. Have drive 04, 09, 2019...every one of them has been absolutely A1. The cars are built to last, gas mileage is awesome, and its a midsize compact with luxury options. Comfortable too!"
6665, 2 years ago,4,"This brand is know around the world, it’s machinery is good. The thing that I don’t like is the interior of the cars, they’re kinda ordinary, the should pay more attention to the details."
6666, 2 years ago,5,This candy is amazing taste and I love and live for candy. I enjoy buying candy of any type and enjoy them everyday because I buy them every meat even if I don’t have too!
6667, 2 years ago,5,This candy is amazing taste and I love and live for candy. I enjoy buying candy of any type and enjoy them everyday because I buy them every meat even if I don’t have too!
6668, 2 years ago,5,This candy is amazing taste and I love and live for candy. I enjoy buying candy of any type and enjoy them everyday because I buy them every meat even if I don’t have too!
6669, 2 years ago,4,"Is the Toyota Corolla a Good Car? Yes, the Corolla is a good compact car. It earns great fuel economy estimates and has a terrific predicted reliability rating. It also has lots of standard driver assistance features and an easy-to-use infotainment system."
6670, 2 years ago,4,"I’ve only had the car for 2 weeks, but it feels like a small Avalon. Great luxury for such a small car and very comfortable! Base model includes lots of extras. A+"
6671, 2 years ago,5,I love how easy this car drives! It also comes with a backup camera that is extremely useful especially in the night time. This was the first car that we owned with auto bluetooth connectivity so synching up the music on my phone to the car automatically has been my favourite thing about driving this car!
6672,2 years ago,5,I got my corolla brand new in 2013. I still have it today and have had no problems with the car. Only the typical maintenance has been needed. I feel the price point is affordable and is a great option for a car buyer
6673, 2 years ago,5,"Love my Prius! The gas mileage is outstanding! Love the drive of it, very smooth! The car has much more room than you would think!"
6674, 2 years ago,5,"This car is my baby! Awesome quality for the price. I love the Eco-mode to conserve gas. The car drives well, eliminates outdoor noise, and is compact in size but roomy inside. Back seat is spacious and seats fold down. I would recommend this to a first-time car buyer for value and resale value. "
6675, 2 years ago,3,Good car but it is very small in the inside. My family and I took a road trip in this car and it was VERY uncomfortable. We were all squished together and could barely move. The trip was almost 24 hrs long!
6676, 2 years ago,5,Toyota’s are such reliable cars. My dad owns a Camry 2008 and it has over 200k miles on it yet it still drives just fine. If your looking for a long term car a Toyota should do u good for a lifetime.❤️
6677, 2 years ago,5,"best car ever. best design , affordable price and very comfortable. l love these brend so much . l have this car and l recommend it too <3 "
6678, 2 years ago,5,"this is my 2nd Camry(2015) my 1st was a 2007. They are really nice cars, good on gas and last a longgg time. Mileage is amazing on these cars. I wish they do a little more upgrading on tech stuff..i would like to know my oil percentage and do not like the 1 oil change a year... but over all great car  that last long "
6679,2 years ago,5,"Best car ever ! Super reliable, it is an old car but it works perfectly. My husband bought it 10 years ago and he never had a problem with it."
6680, 2 years ago,5,My mom owns this car and it’s the cutest thing. I feel like her model is pretty sporty and she’s done such a great job keeping it perfect. It’s a 2 door which she kinda hates but i think it’s a great size just for her to vibe out in. This would be a great first car for anyone looking to buy and makes it an excuse to not be the permanent driver of choice because there’s only so much room 😂
6681, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car, comfy eco friendly. Gas efficient. Love the inside is like a cream color, down side is that it does stain easily. I cannot complaint since this my first modern car, before I had a 99' camry which I loveeeddd"
6682, 2 years ago,5,Love this model of toyota. Well shaped with it’s good salon design. And quite affordable for avarage income family
6683, 2 years ago,4,"Honestly just the Toyota version of the Honda civic. Nice car, reliable and comfortable mid-range sedan. Would buy if I needed a new car."
6684, 2 years ago,4,This car is very reliable and has never broke down on me. It is a good car for a family of 4. I would improve the car by adding a 3rd row for bigger family’s. This car is affordable. I recommend this product to people who need a reliable car for cheep.
6685, 2 years ago,5,My first car was a Toyota and while I had it I got in 2 accidents a lady hit me from behind and the second time I sadly flipped it and  totaled it but in both accidents it kept me safe with out a single scratch would highly recommend them
6686,2 years ago,5,"mi carro que siempre habia querido, tengo el 2017 y super comodo, amplio y un diseño clasico como los de toyota. "
6687, 2 years ago,5,I have rented this car and love it ! The drive is nice and the features are even better !
6688, 2 years ago,4,I’ve driven an older Camry so it felt like I was driving a box and the pedals did not push smooth
6689, 2 years ago,4,Loving the body on the new Camry so sporty and luxe. I just wish the inside paneling wasn’t so plastic and that the media system wasn’t that black iridescent plastic that catches every piece of dust and fingerprint.
6690, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2001 Corolla and have never had a problem with it. It is comfortable and economical, the pieces are cheap and easy to find."
6691, 2 years ago,4,"Toyota Camry is very comfortable and safety for driving,for example with baby,and also it does not have voice isolation,that's why it is cons of that product.i would have improved this kind of car like that.what about price,it has normal price with normal quality."
6692, 2 years ago,3,"This car is perfect with low budget,I can say this is one pros,but also It has some disadvantages,it is not comfortable and also with noise it has some problems.Inside has small space,it is not so safety. So to be honestly,i would not buy this kind of car."
6693, 2 years ago,4,"These are great cars for beginners they are easy to handle and you can identify any blind spots almost immediately. However, working in the automotive industry I have come to understand that no matter what vehicle you drive you will always have to get something fixed, the Corolla is notoriously bad about having to have parts replaced and with having issues with the interior panels and the air conditioning, as well as the power windows."
6694, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota always one of the go to cars. It was my brothers car when I drove it. He seems to absotolutely love the car and I understand why, its very reliable as well."
6695, 2 years ago,5,Great brand of cars. Have same price for years and is a good investment. Comfortable
6696, 2 years ago,5,this is a great car. it drives really smoothly and has navigation and is on the newer side. it’s a medium sized car
6697,2 years ago,4,The Prius is a very reliable hybrid car. It is compact and easy to manuever. It is great for squeezing into small street parking spaces as well. I save alot on gas and only need to go to the gas station once a month. I would definitely recommend as all Toyota cars have reliablity and longevity
6698,2 years ago,5,"I have the RAV4 hybrid and I love driving it as I commute to work daily. As other Toyota cars, it is very reliable and a smooth ride. I also save alot of gas when driving in the city so that has been a huge plus. I have also used this car for roadtrips and it's great for storing large luggage in the back. I highly recommend!"
6699,2 years ago,5,"Por ecológico, ahorro de gasolina, control y espacioso para mi que tengo hijos, fácil de manejar, diseño y practicidad"

6704, 2 years ago,5,My sienna drives smooth. It has great trunk and foot space. Easy in and out with carseats. Definitly recommend as a family vehicle.
6705, 2 years ago,5,In my opinion toyotas are the most reliable cars. The camery gives good milage and drives really smooth and they look nice too.
6706, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Camry! It is the best car and super safe, definitely worth it as a car, I went to many different dealerships and ended up taking the Camry and I don’t regret it at all! I have the sports edition and it is a smooth drive and very friendly on gas!"
6707, 2 years ago,5,"I have toyota prius that release in 2008. I bought this car last year and this is relief! when i drive a car i don't bother any noise, this cars are so comfortable, cheap and really good. if you need econom cars you need to buy this car absolutely. it burning a so little."
6708, 2 years ago,5,Toyota Celica is a car that seems to run forever. At 200k miles on the original motor and still kicking it shows no signs of stopping yet. Things on the body have had to be replaced like the weather stripping but that has more to do with the ridiculous heat here than anything. The car is still purring to this day 20 years later.
6709,2 years ago,5,Its fine. I mean its a car like any other car. Its spacious enough. Goes on smooth on the road. No one I know has ever complained about this car so its all good. Plus its a family car & is also not that expensive as compared to other cars.
6710, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota is another brand if car that it's great, we had our old car for more than 20 years and we didn't had serious problems with it!! We decided to sell it for a bigger one since our family  is growing."
6711, 2 years ago,5,"I love my little car! Yes this car is very tiny but it’s comfortable for me! I am 28, I have 2 toy poodles and I’m 5’6 and curvy and I fit fine! There is plenty of trunk space and the mpg are amazing i can fill my car up $20 or less and full tank can last me about a week and a half! On a full tank i get about 359mils till empty! Bomb 💣 my color is cute, touch screen and just very modern. Just because you have a small car doesn’t mean your have to give into the luxury detail! Only thing missing is a center arm rest but i have plenty of cup holders for my my morning joe!"
6712, 2 years ago,4,"I have a 2009 Corolla that is reliable, but sometimes feels cheap and not too luxurious. It is safe, and all in all great condition. I have found that the paint has worn off quickly over the years. The interior looks nice and clean! I think it's a great started car, but maybe not a forever car."
6713, 2 years ago,3,"Drives okay, but I'm not a fan of sedans so I wouldn't buy one. Its pretty roomy inside but seems to need servicing quite often."
6714, 2 years ago,5,"Very comfortable for the entire family! If you have kids, a minivan is a must. Recently purchased a Toyota Sienna and it's been amazing! Toyota has a great record run for very reliable cars. Highly recommend to anyone with or without a family."
6715, 2 years ago,5,I have a 91’ Toyota Camry  she’s still running  this are fantastic cars that will keep going with the proper maintenance  
6716,2 years ago,5,An older model that has run great for years. A great generic car that you can always find parts for without a problem
6717,2 years ago,4,Is a good car and is not expensive. Toyota’s are easy to repair and they are look expensive
6718, 2 years ago,5,I haven’t been in one in years but they were always my favorite. Good cars. Nice looking and hold their own for a long time. My boyfriend in high school drove one forever lol I don’t have much else to say about it .
6719,2 years ago,5,Its a good vehicle.  Not flashy but lots of space. I have a family of 5 and we go camping and its fits us all and all of our equipment
6720, 2 years ago,5,This has been the best car I've ever owned. It's super comfy for long trips and is amazing on gas mileage. My boys are fighting over who gets it when they start driving.
6721,2 years ago,5,I love this vehicle!!! I test drove pretty much ever small SUV on the market and while I do like the Honda CRV in terms of tech and some other features the Toyota RAV4 won out in terms of drive ability and safety. This thing drives like a small car with the comfort of a smal SUV. The turn radius alone was reason enough to buy this car but you also have the quality and assurance that comes from buying a Toyota. These cars are made to last!
6722, 2 years ago,5,"Very stylish and easy to drive. Comfortable chairs , parking control is amazing and more important is is hybryd "
6723, 2 years ago,4,I love this car! I got this car for my 18th birthday and I wouldn't have wanted any other car. My car requires a of patience and attentiveness. But all in all it is a good car. This car was reasonable in price I bought it from a family member for about $2000
6724, 2 years ago,5,"This car is everything I’ve ever wanted. It’s great, safe, and reliable. I’ve had 3 Toyota’s in 21 years and still use 2 of them daily. I’ll never drive anything but a Toyota! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great car! The visibility out of the windshield is a little limited compared to my sienna, but the car itself is great. I love it!"
6725, 2 years ago,5,"I drive a 2008 Sienna with 230,000 miles on it nearly every day and have no problems. It needs maintenance just like any other car but I love this van. It’s always been super reliable and I love driving it. It’s a great car that will last a very long time"
6726, 2 years ago,4,I drive my boyfriend car alot! Its a great car and is older and still in great shape! Its a very nice car snd very smooth to drive! They are great cars for the price of them! I was recommend this car to others!Toyota Corolla
6727, 2 years ago,5,Im a Toyota lover! I've had mine current Highlander for almost 9 years and haven't had any issues with it. Im over 100K miles and plan to see 200K with this vehicle. The maintenance is affordable. When I replace this vehicle I'm sure it will be with another Toyota
6728, 2 years ago,5,I LOvE my sequoia! It has everything and it was actually pretty cheap considering all the upgrades! Toyota’s last forever and this is proving to be! I will always have a Toyota!
6729, 2 years ago,5,"mi el espacio me encanto, perfecto para la familia, muy espacioso, comoda super linda ligera de facil manejo "
6730, 2 years ago,5,I love my car! It is fast and great on gas! It only takes me 30 and under to fill. Full tank last me a week. My complaint would be that it is small. I am a tall girl I have to put my seat all the way back so if someone is in my backseat they are not comfortable.
6731, 2 years ago,5,"I love my RAV4, it’s a 2002 and it still continues to drive great. I know it’s old now, but it has lasted me so long and don’t really see myself getting rid of it just because it’s old. I love my RAV4! It’s still working great and I love that it continues to be a reliable vehicle for me. I have two children, and I still feel safe driving around town with my babies in the car. My parents just purchased a 2019 model and my best friend purchased a 2020 model after driving my old RAV4 because they loved it and they could not believe the long life my RAV4 has had so far and still running beautifully."
6732, 2 years ago,4,I definitely love this car. I love the fact that is really big and confortable. Even if we are 5 in the car we are still ok without any space problems
6733, 2 years ago,3,I love this car. I think that is perfect if you have to drive in the city. It is the right size for everyday life of a normal family who have to go to the supermarket or somethings like that
6734, 2 years ago,5,"My Toyota was the best car I have ever driven. I drove that car for 100,000 miles more then any car I have ever heard of. Toyotas are so reliable and safe and affordable. I would honestly prefer to drive q Toyota then any other car on the market."
6735, 2 years ago,5,Love this car. My mom own this best mileage I've ever had. She let me borrow hybrid Prius for a 7hr roadtrip. Only took 60buck there and back AMAZING!🙌🏽
6736, 2 years ago,4,"The Toyota Corolla gets great gas mileage, has plenty of driver assistance technology, and earns the best predicted reliability rating in the compact car class"
6737, 2 years ago,5,"Well is not Fanncy but is a good car, my husband has one from 2017, the only thing I don’t like is I little overcrowded iff I put a kid seat"
6738, 2 years ago,4,"I love my little Corolla. It gets great gas mileage, handles well and is a fairly smooth ride. My only complaint is it is kind of tight space wise with a car seat. Overall it is very reliable and I would recommend."
6739,2 years ago,5,It was a corolla 2009 sport . Very nice reliable car. Good with gas as well and as long as you kept it up to date never really gave any problems
6740,2 years ago,4,"My husband drives a Toyota Tundra. It is very large and spacious, has a lot of bed space, and the power is great for large jobs. I love driving it occasionally as well! Im 5'2"" and i don't have a problem driving it."
6741,2 years ago,5,"One of the first cars I’ve driven, it’s a bit smaller than a Camry but has everything you need in a sedan. I would recommend this as a beginner car because it is extremely easy to drive and safe to be in."
6742,2 years ago,5,"If I didn’t want to own a luxury sedan, I would opt for the Camry for its reliability and style. It is easy to drive and has everything I need in a car. Also I know this car will last me forever and I won’t have to worry about it’s performance."
6743, 2 years ago,5,"Me gusta lo confortable que es este auto, muy espacioso y suave al manejar. Yo lo recomiendo para personas que les gusta la comodidad y las buenas cosas, el precio no es alto y aunque fuera vale totalmente la pena por la calidad que uno compra. Si tienen la oportunidad, pruébenlos."
6744, 2 years ago,5,"The best car he had, has more strength than bigger cars, I don't stay anywhere and in the snow he works as if he were on the normal street. Very comfortable, safe and reliable. Is not expensive and affordable for anyone who wants a good car. I recommend it with closed eyes."
6745, 2 years ago,5,i own a Toyota corrolla 2012 and my favorite thing about this car is it is amazing on gas
6746, 2 years ago,4,Very relaxing to drive in the city. Quiet enough under normal conditions. Parking assist is fun to use.

If asked if i would recommend this car to a close and trusted friend the answer would be a resounding YES!! If you are looking for quality and dependability for your money look no further."
6748, 2 years ago,5,"Very easy to find parts for this car , very reliable. Drives really smoothly. And you can save money on gas"
6749,2 years ago,5,"Great reliable car. Gets me from a to b. Never had a problem with it.as long as I look after it, it will look after me.  I would only improve it to a newer car that would be a little cheaper"
6750, 2 years ago,5,"This is my first car so maybe I am biased, but moving forward I will never buy another brand of car. I have a 2010 Toyota Corolla and I’ve owned it for three years. For such an older car with many km on it, I have never had one thing go wrong with it (knock on wood). They are gas efficient, easy to maintain and trustworthy. Toyota’s are a pricier vehicle on the market, but it’s because they are solid and reliable. The parts for Toyota’s are affordable in comparison to other manufacturers as well which is a pro. Forever a Toyota person!"
6751, 2 years ago,5,"Camrys and Corollas are great cars. Camrys provide you with extra space and they're both super reliable. The gas mileage is great and the price range for one is great as well. I would recommend to anyone, especially as a first car or in need of a daily driver."
6752, 2 years ago,5,"I love my corolla, I've had a 2002 and a 2004. They're reliable, inexpensive and great on gas. It's a small car and that's what I love about it. I have no complaints. They are inexpensive and you can find whatever year you're looking for for a great price, I'd recommend to anyone"
6753, 2 years ago,5,Great car. Mom had one since 1998 and it still runs good. It's a dependable car and gets good gas mileage. It is a more affordable car than mist are these days.
6754,2 years ago,4,I have a Toyota Corolla and I really love it. It’s the perfect little car for me and it drives pretty well. I got it for a good deal and I would definitely recommend this car and Toyota in general.
6755, 2 years ago,5,"Love this car! It is super practical and fills up with gas easily and it is not expensive. It speeds up fast and it an easy car to maneuver. No issues, very cute and easy to park! Recommend!"

6757, 2 years ago,5,My cars name is Ruby and I’ve had her for a little over a month now. She’s a ‘97 baby like me but she gets me to and from where I need to be. Because she is older I do have mild maintenance to do on her but anything besides going back to public transportation.
6758, 2 years ago,5,My sister has this car and its very nice and spacious. Love the sun roof and the style of the car. Plus it has a the back up camera too
6759, 2 years ago,4,"I had a 2018 Toyota Camry and I loved it. It didn't have a whole lot of bells and whistles but the XLE did it's job getting me around. It didn't guzzle gas, it accelerated well and I never had a problem with it! I loved this car!"
6760, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Prius. It is so easy to drive and gets fantastic gas mileage. For commuting, if I am mostly doing freeway driving I will get almost 50 miles to the gallon. Even when i do more city driving I’m getting AT LEAST 40
Miles to the gallon. It’s definitely been my best friend for long morning and evening commutes!"
6761, 2 years ago,2,"i have a toyota venza and i do like my car but it has the worst blindspots and feels like im driving a BOAT. I gave toyota 2 stars because i have the WORST experiences at the dealerships. 4-6 hours for an oil change with an appointment every time. sometimes takes all day, and they always tell me itll be quick so i make the mistake of waiting there and then my whole day is gone. "
6762, 2 years ago,5,I love the space it provides and now that I have a car seat in the back and the trunk is perfect for stroller. Perfect first time car and family car.

6764,2 years ago,5,"I have a 2008 Limited Highlander and I love it! I love the space, the functions. I hate the high priced maintenance though! Big cars cost more from tires to oil changes. However this car fits my family of 6 perfectly!"
6765, 2 years ago,5,My very first car was a 2004 highlander and boy did I love that car. I’ve been searching to find another one that isn’t too pricy but unfortunately Toyota’s have a high sell value! Will definitely purchase another one in the future

6771, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2005 and it is my tried and true, my trusty steed, my chauffeur. Its not the fanciest Corolla of them all but for 15 years it’s been reliable and practical. A family heirloom one might say. Parts are pretty easy easy to come by so fixing it isn’t an issue or overly expensive. Corollas are all around great, solid and built to last cars."

6774,2 years ago,5,"Love the rav4 ! It’s convenient, efficient and has enough space for traveling! Definitely a recommended car."
6775, 2 years ago,4,"Considero que esta marca de autos sale muy buena. Son automoviles que duran mucho y si alguna vez se sufre de algun choque puede que este se quede igual y no sufra de algun daño, esto ocurre porque sus piezas son muy elaboradas."
6776, 2 years ago,4,"It is a smooth ride all the time, and amazing with gas. I love the space that a lot of this cars have. I would love to own one, one day."
6777, 2 years ago,5,"The car is great and amazing with gas, I love the way my car runs on the high way. I have a beautiful tan color Toyota and she is my baby."
6778, 2 years ago,4,"It’s small and compact. Very easy to drive, but on windy days, you can feel the car shift very easily. I’m not a fan of the steering wheel. It’s a bit stiff. Affordable android comfortable. Great first car"
6779, 2 years ago,5,Increíble! Toda las variaciones de toyota son súper buenas! Amo mi carro toyota corolla tengo 2 años y buenísimo sigo enamorada de él como el primer día. Amo el exterior pero el interior también. Vale la pena completamente recomiendo que si buscan un carro le echen un ojo a los corollas
6780, 2 years ago,4,"This car is great for going to work everyday l, traveling to different states, going fishing, and just general everyday stuff."

6782,2 years ago,5,"I have a 2005 Toyota Camry, and he's been running great! I love my car and will swear by the Toyota brand. All my immediate family drive Toyotas and are very happy with them! I bought him used, so he has a few small cosmetics issues. However, they don't effect how he runs at all!"
6783, 2 years ago,5,Excelente vehículo 🚗 espacioso. Bastante cómodo entre los espacios de asientos de adelante y de atrás. Me gusta su color tinto. Es elegante. Y es marca Toyota. Un icono en el mundo. #Toyota #ilove #autos #influenster

6785, 2 years ago,5,I bought this after I needed a bigger car to fit my dogs. It is great on gas mileage and made me feel very safe. If I had not moved to a hilly dirt road with harsh road conditions I would of kept it.
6786, 2 years ago,5,This was my first little car and is perfect for anyone that wants a low payment and lives in a city area.
6787, 2 years ago,5,I love mine! I worked my booty off to drive this thing around! It took me years but I finally got the one of my dreams. You definitely have to like driving trucks to like this car. It has a lot of space and I have been known to fill line with dogs!
6788, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car, It's very recommended for off-roaders. It is very comfortable, safe, and a good looking SUV. I have a 5th generation 2013 made. I enjoy every second of driving it. "
6789, 2 years ago,5,"My mother has been driving Toyota Corolla’s for years! They’re tough, very reliable and easy on the fuel! Shes never had any major issues with it other than the usual wear and tear on any vehicle. Highly recommend Toyota!"
6790, 2 years ago,4,"A smart purchase. Too small for me bc I prefer an SUV versus a sedan for my own car, but an economical choice for many."
6791, 2 years ago,4,"Have bn in one b4 multiple times. It was fine.
Don’t have much else to say other than it seemed comfortable and to drive fine."
6792, 2 years ago,4,I don’t really have any issues with these choices. Only rating a 4 bc they weren’t luxurious or anything. But no complaints whatsoever.
6793, 2 years ago,5,This car is very spacey I love the inside and outside of it. Drives very smooth and I love all the features to it. I love my truck space too!
6794, 2 years ago,5,"I've got an Old toyota Camry. Like 1996 old! It was my moms car that she passed on to me. All I have to say is that it gets me everywhere I need to go! After all these years, the old gal is still kicking. It's also good on gas as well. Toyota is an amazing car"
6795,2 years ago,3,"I dont have enough space, i dont like to drive it, is economic, but not comfortable,"
6796,2 years ago,5,One of the best cars I have ever owned. Never have had a problem with it. Would buy another one!
6797, 2 years ago,4,"When I was looking for a car a few years ago I looked into a Toyota Camry but ultimately it was out of my budget. This car is comfortable, safe, and fun to drive. I enjoy driving it when I get it as a rental. Great full size car."
6798, 2 years ago,5,"Toyota is definitely one of the best brands on the market for cars. We have one from when I was in middle school still running and almost hitting 250,000 miles with only really needing to replace the battery in it and I'm almost graduating college now. This is why for my first car purchase I bought a toyota corolla sport. "
6799, 2 years ago,4,This car is nice my friend has one. I am a Honda girl myself but many people love Toyota. I like the features this car has and it is a little bigger than my civic. Nice car overall
6800, 2 years ago,5,A lo mejor son cosas mías pero esos carros son muy resistentes conozco alguien que lo usa para taxi y se mantiene como nuevo
6801, 2 years ago,5,This is a great car. I’ve had mine since 2012 and it is still a great running and driving car. I trust the Toyota brand. My kids love the roomy backseat and my 6’4” y’all husband is always comfortable in the front seat.
6802, 2 years ago,5,"it's a cheap car!  comfortable, smooth to handle, its accessories are of good quality, the seats are resistant material!"
6803, 2 years ago,5,"this car is all terrain.!  It is comfort, it is comfortable, it is elegant, it is familiar, it is economical in gasoline! without complaint!  i love my car.. its price is fair.. 100% recommended"
6804, 2 years ago,5,"I like this car. Very spacious for a family of four or more. I like that with each upgrade the shape and features offered increase. It's also not bad on gas compared to other SUV's of its size. However, if gas consumption is important to you, I wouldn't go with an SUV."
6805, 2 years ago,5,"Nice car. Much more spacious than a Corolla. If you have a family of two or more I'd recommend this car. It's not very stylish. It doesn't have any interesting features, but a basic version is pretty affordable."
6806, 2 years ago,5,Great driving car. Very durable and go in gas. Wish the cargo area was a little  bigger but otherwise I love it
6807, 2 years ago,5,Todos sabemos que nada como Toyota la verdad es cómodo espacioso y elegante un carro familiar

6811, 2 years ago,5,My toyota is a 1999 Rav 4 and I love it so much.  I bought it used and its never given me issues. If you want a car that will last you a while get a toyota or honda cheap parts and they're made to last a long timee. Hoping my car will last a few more years!!
6812, 2 years ago,4,"Economic. Great gas mileage. Small environmental foorprint. Very quiet and ease of use with power buttons. Has quite the get up and go, for a car of this style. Fairly affordable for an environmentally friendly vehicle. I would recommend."
6813, 2 years ago,5,I love my Rav4. I dread the day when I have to get a new car.... This is the perfect size vehicle for everyday use. It also helped me move in and out of college and everything was able to fit in my car. So spacious!! Also love how it drives. Best car I’ve owned!!!
6814, 2 years ago,5,I love my big red. She fits my family of 4 nicely. Drives like a small crossover but comfortably fits my two kids for daily driving and when we travel. I’ve taken her all over the country and have no complaints. I’ve had her 3 years and expect many more out of her.
6815, 2 years ago,5,This car was my first SUV. I decided to get a rav4 because I previously own a Toyota Corrola and was a super reliable car. This car runs so smooth. I have a 2018 and has a lot of technology. If you want a small suv this is the car for you.
6816, 2 years ago,5,We love our scion.  We have had it since 2006.  It gets great gas mileage.  It is amazing how much you can fit inside it.  We do our own maintenance and it is the easiest of our cars.  Only complaint is she doesnt have a lot of pep in her step but she gets us there easily so not that big of a problem
6817, 2 years ago,5,"I have Toyota rav4,  it is such a comfortable car ,since I get this car we were in prophylaxis only one time 👏🏼👏🏼"
6818, 2 years ago,1,Honestly not that great. I have a 2019 RAV4 and it makes a lot of noise when driving. Not that smooth of a ride either.  
6819, 2 years ago,4,This is a car my friend drives and she loves it because it is higher than regular cars without being a jeep or truck shaped
6820, 2 years ago,4,I think Toyota is one of the most reliable car brands out there. They have excellent customer service which is why i like to go to them because i have a lot of questions and not enough intel on cars
6821, 2 years ago,5,"The Toyota Prius is a good choice among hybrid and electric cars. It has a capable hybrid system, a smooth ride, and unbelievably good fuel economy ratings"
6822, 2 years ago,4,"Great cars at a great value. I would recommend for a first car or an elder. Spacious, simple and very reliable!!!"
6823, 2 years ago,5,There are so many pros to this car. I love my 2015 Toyota Corolla so reliable smooth to drive and very spacious.
6824, 2 years ago,5,Toyota’s are pretty cool. They seem perfect if you’re looking to invest in your first car.
6825, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car! Great on gas!! Bought used and she's a little beat up, but she runs well!"
6826, 2 years ago,3,Mine is a 2011 I like it but its had a recall for the airbags & a week after I got it the main fuse went out so I ended up having to pay almost 500 to gt the car back my warranty wont cover something like that unless it happens 4x 🤦‍♀️ what is that?!?!
6827, 2 years ago,5,"We purchased this car in 2013. Beautiful sedan. Leatherette seats, sunroof, lots of space in the back, nice sound system. My only con would be that the year we had didnt have a backup camera but I think the more recent ones have them installed already. Great on gas, smooth ride. We had this vehicle for 4 years before my husband got into an accident and the vehicle was totaled. Not one time didnwe ever have any major work done on the car. It never gave us any issues. Something worth noting, when my husband got into an accident, the airbags didn't deploy. Being that the vehicle was totaled and he had a huge laceration to his head I'm not sure how to feel about that. I've heard about people having severe injuries from airbags so maybe it would have caused more damage than good. Who knows? He's okay though. Maybe the impact wasnt forceful enough to deploy them. Idk"
6828, 2 years ago,4,"Omg I fell in love with this car about 10-13 years ago. One of my friends owned this vehicle and I always wanted to purchase one myself. Fast forward to the present and my husband and I took one out for a spin at a toyota dealership. I don't know if my interests have just changed but it was definitely not something I would want. It was cute and all, but i love a smooth ride and I felt every bump. I may just be used to riding in bigger sedans and crossovers with larger tires... idk but I felt like it was too compact for my liking. Also, I have 2 kids so 2 cars were a no go for me. It looks gorgeous though"
6829, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car, it’s big enough for 5 people and not feeling squished I feel safe in it, and it’s the perfect size!"
6830, 2 years ago,3,"Cute first car to own. Great on gas, compact, safe. I have to admit this car seems super basic but it's a very affordable car. My friend owned this car and I was interested because of the pros listed above, however I ultimately decided to go with a camry se. It was a little bit bigger and had a lot more features that better suited my needs/interests."
6831, 2 years ago,5,Typical cab car. Efficient and affordable. Maybe all cabs should just be corollas. They are great.
6832, 2 years ago,5,"This was my family car growing up and it was great. I loved it as a child. It was the perfect size for a family of four, baby included. The size was perfect and it ran so smooth."
6833, 2 years ago,5,Toyota cars are great for first cars. They are reliable & cheap to fix. Saves you a lot of money compared to other cars for damages.
6834, 2 years ago,4,"I like the Prius for a lot of reasons- it drives well, the interior is designed to be very usable, the touchscreen is nice, as the gas milage is really great for a commuter. I don’t like how costly the maintenance is on this car. It requires full synthetic oil, so oil changes are always pricey. Parts are expensive for repairs. I don’t even want to think about the hybrid battery needing anything. This is great little commuter car, but don’t think you’re going to save money with the MPG. Maintenance will more than make up for it."
6835, 2 years ago,4,Its a good care can’t complain if it gets me from point A to point B! It’s also a neat comfortable car!
6836, 2 years ago,4,This car has lots of room and its comfortable. I like the leg room it has. The trunk was plenty big and the ride was nice.
6837, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Rav4. I habe 2 children in car seats and this vehicle is big enough to fit them plus our cargo. I like that it is big enough, yet still has a small car feel."
6838, 2 years ago,5,"También tuve un Toyota Camry blanco. Para mi los carros de la Toyota son mis mejores. Toda mi vida he tenido Toyota, en diciembre 2018, compre mi Rav4 2018 . TOYOTA ES TOYOTA"
6839, 2 years ago,5,"Es súper cómodo, es amplio! No puedes negar que es un carro para toda la vida. Me encanta"
6840, 2 years ago,5,"Amo mi carro, aunque no es de este año es un carro que da la talla, es súper cómodo. Lo amo"
6841, 2 years ago,5,I absolutely love it!! Its gets very good gas mileage and is super comfortable. Its pretty roomy and looks very nice.
6842, 2 years ago,5,"El primer carro que tuve fue un Toyota Corolla, me encantaba ese carro. Económico, fácil para guiar y de buena calidad"
6843, 2 years ago,5,"Tuve una que compre nueva en el 2006, y la tuve hasta  diciembre 2018 que me compré otra nueva del 2018. Pues soy fiel a la Toyota, porque salen muy buenos. Compré la del 2018, porque la otra ya tenía 12 años, pero aun estaba en buenas condiciones. TOYOTA ES TOYOTA"
6844, 2 years ago,4,It is a very comfortable ride. Lots of storage space. It is a safe highway vehicle. No problems so far in the first three years.
6845, 2 years ago,5,It’s a very smooth nice car.  Never owned a Toyota until this purchase and we love it.
6846, 2 years ago,4,"This car is super reliable and very roomy. The only drawback is that it doesn’t have enough power for my liking! It’s a great family car and overall, very safe. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a spacious and reliable sedan."
6847, 2 years ago,4,"Great car! Dependable, sporty and just the perfect amount of space. It's just me and my husband so we don't need tons of space. There is plenty of room for all our camping gear and still space for our dogs. Great on gas and love the sporty design. I especially love the new models, wish we could have waited one more year to get the new model but I still love ours."
6848, 2 years ago,4,"I live in NYC so I do not own a car but many ubers are Toyota Camrys or Corollas so I figured I would post a quick review here. Decent car, great price point and generally one of the safest. And on top of all of this, it is a Japanese product so what is not to love? "
6849, 2 years ago,5,"My mom has a Toyota Highlander and I am always driving it. It’s such a smooth drive, love the touch screen inside. The little blue lights inside the car add such a great touch!"
6850, 2 years ago,5,"I recently sold my 2009 Toyota Sequoia for $12,000. I absolutely loved that car. Perfect vehicle for a soccer mom. Way better than a minivan. It’s perfect for a large family, seats 8. Very comfortable and it’s nice not to bend over to put a car seat in. It has the hooks to attack the car seat in addition to the seatbelts. The new Sequoias are even better than the 2009. They have all the bells and whistles. They retain their value better than most other vehicles."
6851, 2 years ago,4,"I use Toyota Camry 2009 and it is okay, do not spend a lot of money for fix or replace anything. My car use 6 batteries so that it spend a lot of gas. I have used it for 3 years. In my opinion, it suitable for student or someone newbie"
6852, 2 years ago,5,I have been a passanger and I also drove a Prius and the experience is wow! I loved it so much and I wish I had one of my own
6853, 2 years ago,3,This car is great for students and for people with budget. Not my favorite one . It reminds me of iron
6854, 2 years ago,5,Its economy. Has beautifull outside and inside. Like stereo system and drive:))))))))))
6855, 2 years ago,4,These are nice vehicles and last a good amount of time with the right upkeep and maintenance. They ride smooth and are comfortable doe travel with kids or without
6856, 2 years ago,5,I love love love 4Runners! They have so much space for passengers and great trunk space. Very beautiful car and love how it drives. It is kinda expensive and isn’t great on gas.
6857, 2 years ago,4,"It does pretty well and hasn't given me any problems yet. It is a little iffy in the snow but still does well. It had a few recalls depending on the year so look out for that but again, overall a pretty decent car that's easy to take care of and keep on."
6858, 2 years ago,5,Love this car! Great for large family’s or a dog owner who needs the space! Love the off road capabilities and how well it handles on and off pavement. There are many trim levels to choose from to make sure you’re not either over or under extending yourself. I love the 4Runner
6859, 2 years ago,5,I have a 2019 rav4 adventure and it’s the best! The gas mileage is amazing at 30mpg highway and 28 city... I feel like I never have to get gas anymore! All in all you’re paying a little more for a car that will have little to no problems and make sure you safely arrive from a to b. Toyota it means no worry’s for the rest of your days...
6860, 2 years ago,5,"It’s very comfortable, really good and easy to drive, economic and unique, me and my family are very happy with this car"

6863, 2 years ago,5,Huge family car. It has a lot space and i would highly recommend if you have a big family.
6864, 2 years ago,5,I bought a 2010 Toyota Corolla brand new in 2010 and drove it after I graduated high school until a few months ago. The reliability with this car is a 10/10 for sure! Couldn’t have asked for a better first vehicle.
6865, 2 years ago,5,corolla is the BEST car for a college student good gas mileage great capacity and it’s just a stunning car to own first time around perfect size and ah perfect!

6867, 2 years ago,5,love this car it’s super classy and drive beautifully. love the interior and it’s just an iconic SUV
6868, 2 years ago,5,"I loved my 2011 Prius. Coming from a Jeep Liberty, I was looking for better gas mileage primarily since I commuted & was spending a ton weekly. This was a tank, I was in an accident & the damage was cosmetic compared to the person who hit me, safety was great.  I couldn't get over how the power & speed, I went into owning expecting a huge drop in performance. I had to keep on cruise to stop getting tickets. The ride was super smooth & quiet, the cabin space massive. Had a new appreciation for the space when I was moving & fit my apartment in a few trips. Loved the design, had no complaints, got great life & high mileage with regular maintenance."
6869, 2 years ago,5,"The most reliable car I've ever had! My Camry has been my daily driver for years now. I've never had any issues with her yet! I'm over 350,000 miles and shes going strong."

6878, 2 years ago,5,"My mom owned a Camry for a short period of time, and she seemed to like it. It was a nice size and easy to drive. She traded it in after only a few months if I remember correctly, but that was only due to the fact that having a black car caused people to hit it at night more often. Other than that, there were no complaints."
6879, 2 years ago,5,I love my toyota camry. I have the 2012 model and the only thing i wish it had was a backup camera.
6880, 2 years ago,5,"I had a rental car that was a 2017 4runner. I love that I could switch how many cylinders I was using, to save on gas when I was not towing anything. Even the base model has tons of gadgets and gizmos. Very comfortable to drive long distance and easy to handle."

6882,2 years ago,4,Love my corolla! Ive had it for over 13 years and it’s steady and reliable! Do my regular maintainence and it’s great with gas  
6883, 2 years ago,5,This car is amazing I have gone off-roading with this vehicle many times super reliable there is so much space in this car but still lots of control and easy to drive.

6884, 2 years ago,4,Love this car! I’ve owned many cars from Toyota and this is definitely one of my favorites
6885, 2 years ago,5,"My husband had a Toyota Corolla before we met and when we first married. He bought this because it had great gas mileage and was a great price. This was his spare car. I ended up driving it more often than not due to fuel efficiency. The ride was smooth and the car was reliable. This car was not special. It was practical and efficient. For that, we loved it greatly. We eventually upgraded to a different Toyota model."
6886, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love this car. Before this car, I ended up getting whatever car Grandad found for me. For ten six years, I traded up one car for the next and they all ended up being white. When it was time to actually pick out a car of my own, I did a lot of research. As a mom, I loved the safety ratings of the Toyota Camry. After five white cars, I was only sure that I didn’t not want another white vehicle. At the (used car) dealership, I saw absolutely nothing that appealed and no Camrys. Disheartened, I decided to leave. Upon leaving the salesman asked if there were any cars that appealed or and prices that needed lowering. I had noticed this sporty white Camry in the already sold lot. Half joking, I stated that if he has any other cars that look sporty and solid like that, he would have my attention. He laughed and said that the sale had recently fallen through and to make an offer. I have had no regrets. We have had no issues, it’s comfortable, attractive, gets good gas mileage, is safe, and I absolutely love it...and the color. I was actually rear ended when driving this vehicle. The young man (while safe and sound) totaled his car. My car had a damaged bumper. To me, that says everything. I feel a sense of safety and security driving this vehicle."
6887,2 years ago,5,My prius is my favorite possession! I love how it saves gas. Mine has beautiful white leather seats. The interior is quality made and has so many compartments making it more spacious than many cars its size. My hatchback fits almost anything I need with seats that can lay down. I would buy a newer one in a heartbeat but mine is still going strong with 222k miles!
6888, 2 years ago,5,I love the savings I’ve had on gasoline. It’s very quiet and comfortable. Road noise is loud. The sun visors need to be much larger and be able to pull out for more protection. I would recommend the Prius!
6889, 2 years ago,5,My sister drove a Camry for 10+ years. Great car and drove great forever. Would definitely consider purchasing for my next vehicle.
6890,2 years ago,5,"Very reliable, perfect size, not too big, not too small. Has all the right extras to it."
6891, 2 years ago,5,"It’s stylish and has a professional look, works just fine and from what I’ve heard the parts are easy to find and buy"
6892, 2 years ago,4,I really like my Corolla. It’s small and easy to drive. It gets great gas mileage. It has been a great car. I’ve had it for 6 years and it’s only needed minor adjustments.
6893,2 years ago,5,I sat passenger in my friend's car as she drove this and it drove SUPER SMOOTH and it was so luxurious feeling and sturdy. I would definitely consider getting this car for myself because I know Toyota's are built to last! 
6894,2 years ago,5,"I sat passenger seat in this car with my friend. It was a newer model (around 2018 or so?) and it was LOVELY. Such a nice build, luxurious feeling, and so spacious. "
6895,2 years ago,5,"i LOVE my Toyota Camry. I inherited my car from my grandma, it's from 2003. It STILL lasts me to this day. Luckily since it's an older model it has really sturdy, metal parts and a high level of detail and quality in all of the accessories. Definitely will consider getting a Toyota again whenever I need a new car! "
6896, 2 years ago,5,I tried that car few times and I like it. This is great SUV car for family . Looks great . I prefer white colour. Good to drive on highway. Toyota RAV4
6897, 2 years ago,4,nice solid and super quiet however repairs can get quite costly if the wrong part goes out... over all very reliable brand if i were to purchase another vehicle  i would certainly get another Toyota. As the quality  is a priority for Toyota.
6898, 2 years ago,4,I love my Toyota Corolla. It’s my favorite car ever. The only thing I wish it had was cruise control. Other than that it’s perfect.
6899,2 years ago,5,Car is ridiculously strong. Hold up great after 10+ years. Keep up with maintenance and this cars will last you a really long time
6900, 2 years ago,3,It was ok. I find it very uncomfortable and I am not a big fan of it. It does run smoothly. It definitely needs some fixing.
6901, 2 years ago,4,"I can to Say that is very confotable, in first time it have goob apiriance also have advanced tegnology,always are very fast i prefer this car for yuo aerodinamic stetic too is very sure awesome for travel and your mechanichal is very simpel i think is the Best mark o vehichle of the world is all My opinión abaout that product."
6902, 2 years ago,5,Great quality car that has stood the test of time! Toyota builds them for life. Mine is a 2001 and still running almost 20 years later. We upgraded to a highlander but I have nothing but good things to say about the Camry! Lifetime Toyota fan here!
6903, 2 years ago,4,"My mom purchased her RAV4 brand new from Toyota, I couldn’t wait to take it out for a drive! I drove to Yosemite and had a weekend camping trip, this car was great for the trip, good gas mileage, comfortable to ride in, and was overall a great car for the trip! 
The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of VALUE, although Toyota cars hold their value for a while, for 30k price tag, it should include most options."
6904, 2 years ago,5,"In my opinion, Toyota is the best choise! 🚘 
Aaaaan jeep? Definitely- Rav4! 👌
I like it very much,becaus it is a hybrid and cleaner for our ecology than other non-hybrid cars 🌎. 
It is more comfortable for me and i prefer it ! 🤝"
6905, 2 years ago,4,"Purchased a 2019 RAV4 and can honestly say it's a great and reliable vehicle. I am looking to trade it in as I find that my vw golf is just much more modern with the interior. With VW I found I got more for my money than with Toyota. My RAV4 does not have navigation, but it does have a heated steering wheel. One thing I found odd is that the seat warmers only warm your back and not your butt. "
6906, 2 years ago,5,"Incomparable visuals, distinctive appearance, ideal interior, ideal perception of speed, a car that can do everything. Comfortable, elegant and sophisticated.New Vision in the Car Industry,A car that understands your wordlessness"
6907, 2 years ago,5,"Great car. Very spacious, comfortable, and super reliable!!  I've seen other Toyota's that has lasted over 20 years"
6908, 2 years ago,5,"I have had 2 other cars in the past and this has been by far my favorite! Great gas mileage, safe to drive in, not expensive to keep up with, and rides very smooth!!"
6909, 2 years ago,5,"This is my first ever car that I bought when I was 16. It’s super sleek since it is a sports car and drives very well. It has 2 doors and the back space is very cramped/limited, but if you’re not looking to have a bunch of people ride with you, you should be fine!"
6910, 2 years ago,5,I have a Scion xB and love it it’s the best car I’ve owned ! They don’t make it anymore which sucks ! Bring back scion !!!!
6911, 2 years ago,4,Great little car runs good and you all the features are great they're nice and comfortable just a good car
6912, 2 years ago,4,It's not my car it's my fiance's car but it is a pretty good car like it's a great car. It drives good and it's a stick shift but I don't know how to drive a stick so I wouldn't be able to drive it but it is like an awesome car I like the features that come with it has the backup camera it's spaces the seats are nice comfortable there's enough room for everybody and it's just a little nice car and if he paid a good price for it like he he did good in Toyota I did good too.
6913, 2 years ago,5,Just wanted to let everyone know if you have a 2019 that jerks or “lurches” from a roll stop or yield. Toyota can reprogram your drivetrain from a service bulletin to correct this. Mine did this and it bugged me. Did research and found Toyota is aware and it’s a very easy fix. Now transmission shifts perfectly at any speed. This is best looking suv around right now. Doesn’t feel like driving a boring mini van like most others.
6914, 2 years ago,3,I’m not a fan for Toyota’s mainly because every time I drive one it’s not a smooth drive at all. The Camry in particular is not at all a smooth drive. Also I’m biased and hate small cars.
6915, 2 years ago,5,Love love love my car! Honestly the best investment I made. Before I bought this I had a small car. But then when I had my daughter I realized I needed something a bit bigger and more reliable for having a family.
6916, 2 years ago,4,I drove it once its was pretty good. Comfortable to drive but it  wasn't up to date like the rest of the cars. Gas seems to last longer which is good.
6917, 2 years ago,3,Not the best car I’ve ever had. Mine came missing a lot of basic things like the hatchback cover and floor mats. The dealership wasn’t honest with me about everything. The car had had a lot of issues. Don’t recommend.
6918, 2 years ago,5,This car is great on gas and it’s super nice on the inside. My favorite thing is the black interior with the blue lining. It really pops! The car really lasts and is a good starting car or for a little family. Drives super smooth!
6919, 2 years ago,5,"Very smooth sailing car. Feels very safe. Love the cameras. Seats are very comfortable and it’s bluetooth system is amazing. Love driving this car around, looks very sleek and expensive as well. Definitely would recommend"
6920, 2 years ago,4,"Good compact automobile. Price not expensive, husband likes this car for city’s life. We have white color. Easy operation and maintenance of the car. Affordable for small families. I recommended for all"
6921, 2 years ago,5,I love this vehicle I love the interior. It's a great family car it's enough for my 2 kids and my spouse and I of course. It's great for out of town trips very roomy.
6922, 2 years ago,4,This vehicle was so memorable I don’t. I probably would use again though as was a rental from Budget rent-a-car.
6923, 2 years ago,4,"It got me where I needed to go. I believe this was a rental on the isle of Kauai, HI. It was an older model 1980’s and It was great on gas. I like vehicles that are trucks and have good gas mileage. This was an act of desperation. I’m humble and thankful though at the time I had no car."
6924, 2 years ago,4,I've found that this model vehicle is easy to handle. Very smooth ride and it's very comfortable. The features of the car is simple and very much to my liking and tastes. I'd recommend this vehicle because it burns gas very well also.
6925, 2 years ago,5,The best car ever! I have had mine for a super long time & it’s gone a ton of miles without a problem! It’s a super affordable car that will surely run as long as it’s kept up! Toyotas are my favorite brand of vehicles!
6926, 2 years ago,5,"This car drives super smooth & seems as if it can go a ton of miles without ever having problems. Things are rarely ever wrong with it, and when it does have problems it’s very inexpensive to fix because the car is just overall affordable."
6927, 2 years ago,5,"I freaking love this car.  It's compact but spacious enough. I love the design and the finishes. So easy to drive, great car for beginners. There's nothing I would change in this car. I totally recomend it."
6928, 2 years ago,5,Its very spacious and fast. The only thing I would complain about is that the front passenger seat is doesn’t go back enough and I hit the dashboard of the car almost everytime and scratch my knee because it is so stuck out.
6929, 2 years ago,5,I drive a 2013 scion xb and I never truly thought I would have liked a box shaped car. This car is the most roomiest car I have ever had. The back seats fold down and I can fit alot in the back. The gas mileage is about 26 mpg and not many car repair to date. Very happy I love my car!
6930, 2 years ago,5,"Good smooth ride.
Great technology and easy ride.
My Mom's last 3 cars have been Rav 4s. They are stylish and technology advanced.  I've never had an issue with our Toyota's."
6931, 2 years ago,5,"I own a Toyota Corolla 2020 and it’s really comfortable and what you pay for oil it’s crazy , like 20 bucks"
6932,2 years ago,5,One of the best vehicles on the market right now. Toyota is reliable and trustworthy. Great on gas and fantastic for traveling cross country. I drove one up to Canada then to California and all the way to Florida. Loved it so much. A great safe family vehicle.
6933, 2 years ago,4,It’s a great little car. Has excellent gas mileage and lots of room for passages and cargo. I don’t care for the instrument arrangement and the dash. It’s an average price so if you’re looking for a hybrid it’s a good choice.
6934, 2 years ago,5,"Great car, drives smooth and is very comfortable. Lots of room for passages and has good gas mileage. Very comfortable to take road trips in. It’s  a tad more then some other comparable cars, but it’s worth it."
6935, 2 years ago,5,"I bought an used car, and it's in great conditions. Over 50k miles, and it runs perfectly, I love this car, no need to spend hundreds on gas, fast, comfortable. Just what I needed"
6936, 2 years ago,5,Very practical. Has good amount of space and rides smoothly.  The size is not too big and not too small.
6937, 2 years ago,4,It’s a good little family car. I have never owned one but I’ve Been in one many times.
6938, 2 years ago,4,"A good car, comfortable but wish it had touchscreen radio. reliable but battery goes flat often"
6939, 2 years ago,5,This is the second RAV4 I have owned. It is an affordable all wheel drive car. It has so much passenger and storage space also. It is the perfect upgrade from a sedan to something bigger because it is a manageable size.
6940, 2 years ago,5,"I love all SUVs.And Toyota was of them when we had to pick ours.its comfortable,it’s huge,work for family with kids and without kids."
6941, 2 years ago,4,"This product was safe, reliable and sleek. The drive was Great. It was pretty big and had plenty of storage."
6942,2 years ago,5,Nice car... Feels like driving a sports car... Spacious compartment... Affordable... Highly recommended... Pretty sturdy vehicle...
6943,2 years ago,5,"Nice car... Light to drive for the size of the car... Perfect for family travel, big compartment space... Spacious compare to other minivans... Affordable although has negative impact in insurance... Hoghly recommended..."
6944,2 years ago,3,This van didn't drive well.  It's handling and road noise were rough.  It had blind-spots and wasn't easy to maneuver.
6945, 2 years ago,4,"Good, safe, economical car. I have a manual and am very pleased with this in the city. Great gas mileage and reliable."
6946,2 years ago,5,Great car! Very fast and a great car to add lots of accessories to. Easy to make it your own. I would recommend this car for everyone.
6947, 2 years ago,4,"My aunt just got this about a year ago and has fallen in love with it. She told me she will not be buying any other vehicle because of all the great features. She loves how elevated and comfy it is, and I love driving along with her."
6948,2 years ago,3,"I test drove this car and its pricing was comparable to a Honda CR-V. However, you can hear it's engine revving when you are accelerating and that was not reassuring. The seats can be adjusted high to give us short folks a better view and the seats kind of hug you, but it felt firm and cheap. The inside also felt really tight but you are paying for a basic 4-cylinder SUV after all. Toyota is still very well known and reliable."
6949, 2 years ago,5,This was my first car and I loved it so much! This car is perfect for girls because is a small one and is simple to park it and also is a good one for teens that just have a pass the exam and they need a car. This one is no expensive and I recommend it!
6950,2 years ago,5,The Highlander is a nice vehicle my mother-in-law owns one it’s roomy big so you feel safe and the seats are cozy drives nicely.
6951, 2 years ago,5,"Gently walks, has a nice salon. Fast and very comfortable. What I like most is the economy car. I consider it a sophisticated model"

6953, 2 years ago,5,This is a great vehicle for 4x4. Has ok gas mileage. Rides really smooth. Roomy and comfy. Great for snow also.
6954, 2 years ago,5,"Great first car! I love my Prius C! The gas mileage is great, and it is great car to get where I need to go. Smaller trunk space, definitely pricey, but well worth the money. I would recommend to anyone!"
6955, 2 years ago,5,Cute little car had a couple of them always started up with no problems ran well long as you change your oil wasn’t them too expensive and I really enjoyed owning it
6956, 2 years ago,5,My Camary was very nice very smooth leather seats good engine I couldn’t of been happier I would definitely buy another one and yeah I love my Toyota little expensive but it’s worth it￼
6957, 2 years ago,5,"Leased a Toyota Corolla sport back when I was in college. The car was definitely small but I am 5’8” and fit perfectly compared to my 6’7” bf. It definitely had some speed to it. It was a great travel car, never gave me any problems. I would say Toyota cars are super reliable, priced great and are designed for comfort and style."
6958, 2 years ago,5,Awesome car. Great safety feature. Very comfortable seats which are underrated but you learn to appreciate when you drive all day.
6959, 2 years ago,5,"My family has had it for years, and can’t go wrong! It’s a beautiful silver and we put blue lights in the interior, and under the car, looks so nice, it drives smoothly and I’d say it’s well built"

Toyota’s are definitely a very reliable car and would highly recommend anyone looking to check this one out! Very very pretty too!
6962, 2 years ago,1,"Very top heavy, terrible traction control, huge blind spots on both sides of the driver, no trunk space"
6963, 2 years ago,4,"Comfortable, spacious, and convenient with three kids under 7. Speaker system to help 3rd row passengers hear front seat passengers. Middle row seats easily removed for more space and 3rd row folds down."
