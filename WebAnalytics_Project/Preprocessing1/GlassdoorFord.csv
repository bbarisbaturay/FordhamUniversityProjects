The role consults multiple businesses that generate millions in revenue, which allows you the opportunity to develop an incredible set of skills that are trasferrable. A vehicle is provided, which is a bonus that negates the personal financial impact of keeping and maintaining a vehicle.Regional offices vary greatly based on the leadership team, some score lower in terms of DEI and have higher turnover. These offices can feel very isolated from HQ initiatives, programs, resources, and oversight. There is very little room for salary negotiation and employees are often compensated far below market value. You will be offered many opportunities with little finanical compensation. Management often does not consult employees before moving them geographically. Be wary."

Great support programs and reps to get you in touch with community services you might need. Free (but very limited/discounted) legal services plan. They pay for your health, dental, and vision insurance. FORD employees are given priority for intake at The Brook Hospital. They pay for college tuition, I think it's $6k per year, possibly per semester. The union can fight for you to keep your job in most instances, along with getting your termination reversed in many cases as well, of course, depending on what rules you broke. There is air conditioning in break rooms, restrooms, offices; and working fans at most every work station. There's a medical dept in the plant with nurses and a doctor for work related injuries or illnesses that occur while on the job. They also have a physical therapy dept on site for those who are prescribed pt to try and help minimize damage from repetitive motion injuries. You go to medical/physical therapy during your shift (while still getting paid) as someone covers your job for you to do so. There's fun union activities at the union hall/out in the community for your family. Holiday parties, trunkortreat, employee appreciation picnics, etc. If you surround yourself with the right people, you can create a great support system/community/extended family for you and your family.Very strange factory ""culture"". Tons of negativity, gossip, drugs, harassment, favoritism, manipulation, and taking advantage of people. You're best to go to work, not socialize with most, and head home straight after. This isn't all there is of course, but it's overwhelmingly THE culture there. They've only been hiring temps the past few years, not hiring them fulltime for years. You only know the max length of your shift, but time varies daily and you don't know what time your shift ends until after halfway through your shift each day. People take advantage (on a whole other level) of any and every loophole they can find, in every single policy resulting in VERY divided and bitter coworkers and regular policy change to try to combat these issues. You have to save your vacation time to use during shut down bc each year. The parking lots are huge and you must get to work very early in order to park, walk through the turnstiles, and inside the building to wherever your specific job may be. There are security guards in the lots but there's still quite a bit of vandalism, theft, and just plain ""working hazard"" damage done to vehicles by people dropping screws and other things in the parking lots. Lots of flat tires for sure. Open drug/alcohol abuse in parking lots on breaks and in between shifts, so it's a difficult place for many to remain sober (without a very good plan ahead of time.) I imagine most factories of this size all having similar issues, but this is the only one I've worked at so I've got nothing to compare it to other than what I've heard from others. There's no a/c, but there is heat for a couple months in mid winter. It's a very loud environment, and an extremely monotonous and boring job that begins breaking your body down fairly early on with all the repetition. The pay is so high because they understand what you're giving up when you work there. You're ultimately trading your quality of life for a higher paycheck and better benefits, but by the time you make it to retirement your body is going to be hurting so much you won't be able to enjoy things as you would've if you'd worked elsewhere. That being said, you'll have the money to do things you wouldn't have been able to if you'd worked elsewhere. Figure out your priority, health or money; it's definitely a tradeoff there. I honestly don't believe there's a way to have both if you work there your entire career. Possibly switching jobs frequently to limit repetitive motion injuries, staying ahead of probable injuries and taking extremely good care of your body, and finding ways to take time off through the year to give your body a much needed break to recuperate are the only ideas I can come up with that might help reach that goal of trying to have both."

Lots of systems of lesson's learned and best practices, but they are not enough to get the whole picture and mistakes still happen.There are lots of people that are very good at their jobs. There are wonderful people who will help you constantly at WERS, or PDLs, or whatever other archaic/unruly system Ford is currently using.People are typically easy to talk to and will do their jobs. You can go around and stop by practically anyone's desk and discuss an issue, you will come to an agreement, and path forward. And know, that you'll only have to prod them 3 times to get what they promised you.This will completely depend on your group, but mainly your supervisor. Your group is your program, NOT your commodity. Ford is completely oriented towards making a vehicle fit together, NOT making each component work the best. This is supposed to cause the different commodities to come together but it rarely does. It also causes repeated mistakes to happen. So you'll see the same issues on multiple programs because the same commodity engineers don't talk with each other that often.Also, products are moving so quickly, by the time an issue is detected, another program has it already in the pipeline. Issues are caused by lack of communication between the different engineers of the same commodity AND when specs change in one group that cause issues in another.There are so many supervisors that seem like lost workers. They have no idea what they are doing or how they got into their position. Even though they have a dozen people reporting to them, they will also be releasing parts and are too busy to BE a boss, or especially, a leader. Because of that, you will be on your own. Fend for yourself, most people will not try to help you on your issues. Rarely, yes, someone will, a bit, but that's rare.So many reporting systems!!! The same 5 pieces of information will need to be reported 90 times a month. Redundant work takes up 2/3 of your engineering time.

He was very technically incompetent and does not act professionally, and practices verbal abuse against his employees and suppliers. He formed an inner circle within the team where all decisions were made. The environment was not healthy and I don't recommend joining if you are considering a career as a Feature Owner."

Corporate vision and strategy is difficult to digest. I am not exactly sure how ""Ford Mobility"" will become profitable and our new ""truths"" are vague and difficult to apply to every day facets of our jobs. CEO, although nice, seems disconnected and scattered.It is difficult to tangibly see your impact in the company.

If you are young or a new grad, the company has some decent benefits for parental leave, new parents, etc.Main focus is on new graduates or those with 03 years experience. If you are older with an established career, you will get sidelined and ignored here. Very little actual career development opportunities, you will be told to go and watch videos at your desk. Never more than one week of training provided per year and the burden for approval is huge...forget meaningful conference and seminar opportunities. Compensation increases are very difficult and typically consist of 23% paid out to everyone once per year regardless of any other parameters. This is known as ""merit increase"" at Ford.  Toxic, no trust environment. CYA at all times!! After hiring, the goal is on financial reporting to management, there is little or no engineering integrity. The company does not produce, it assembles. All vehicle components, hardware, software, etc are sourced out to suppliers based on requirements. Lowest bidder wins. Engineering at this company simply means writing requirements for supplier bids and verifying that the requirements have been met. Project managers and financial bean counters have veto power, not engineers.  The company is also technologically backward...even critical operations and decisions are handled by emailing spreadsheets back and forth. No major corporate ERP system is in place and used throughout the company.  Huge question marks around future tech such as autonomous as most of that (if not all) has been farmed out to other companies."

They will not rock the boat or make any decision that will impact their employment and thus their pension. They do not know how to manage employee conflicts, or request for work assistance. Their standard approach is: be quiet or it goes in your performance review.2) Coworkers will openly insult you in meetings, call you stupid/idiot if you do not agree with their strategy or question their engineering approach.3) Most of my coworkers are very bitter because they feel they haven't been given their due promotion or salary increase. So they will refuse to help any newer coworker or put in any extra effort that involves work outside of their assigned project or causes them to put a few minutes outside of 8 hrs a day. Else they demand that their assigned project deadline be delayed or they get paid overtime, even if they are salaried. So they will basically ask you to reinvent the wheel unless they are compensated. 4) Ford employees who have been around for a while are very good at making look like they do work, when in reality they are just good at coming up with a million obstacles about why something cant be done. The incompetent supervisor, since he/she doesnt know enough, will just go along and buy the excuse. Then employee will spend most of the time on the internet or talk about NFL."

I've been there 5 years and the ""one Ford"" culture from Alan Mulally is all but gone.  At all levels, fiefdoms have been created.  The company's outward messaging is that they're a technology company.  This is far from the truth.  Upper management has promoted talking about great ideas and not implementing them.  They have wasted countless millions/billions on worthless acquisitions only so they can say ""look how techy we are"", when in reality, we don't even know how to make money on cars anymore, much less high tech sectors like autonomous vehicles or mobility ventures.  Pretty soon I expect the bubble to pop (it already has to some extent with the onset of layoffs).  This company has lost its way.  If you're looking for a ""tech"" job, look elsewhere, because you will only be disappointed.  On top of that, comp and growth is poor.  Employees with other job prospects are jumping ship at the first opportunity.  Don't get suckered by the brand name, you'll only be disappointed."

If you are young and looking for a job to do your best work, grow skills, and build a career, then walk away. I chose Ford over multiple FANG offers and I wish I had a timemachine. You have been warned! If you stay too long your skills won’t be marketable. In my interviews, I was explicitly told that the pace of things at the new company would be very different (read fast) from Ford.Performance reviews are a joke. You copy your generic goals from the startofyear to the comments section. Supervisors do not even meet to discuss your career or to give any feedback on what you can do better.Red tape. Every single technical decision goes to layers of supervisors and managers and it never goes to technical experts. I noticed that even the most hard working people spent most of their time getting approvals from managers instead of working with technical experts to make great products.To make matters worse, middle management does not value people for their technical skills. you can come with a bachelors/masters/phd or spend 10 years working at Ford, there are very few managers who will appreciate you for your skills. Most employees (at GSR level) are considered soldiers in an army; the managers only care about the quantity of soldiers, not who they are or what they bring to the table. Makes it very easy to stay underradar if you don't like to work. Becomes very hard to do any work if you want to progress in career.I copied this from another review since it described supervisors very well. ""Since well over half the people do no work, supervisors keep adding staff saying they need more resources to get work done.""Good luck using your personal business days.

If you need to stay in Michigan it is one of the better places to work.Ford IT wants to believe it has transformed to a tech startup company.  Delusional thinking.  Red tape is everywhere.  Innovation is more often penalized than rewarded.Much of IT Leadership are too narrow minded to see innovation potential. Punitive leadership leads to fear based decision making.IT teams hide information from each other and sabotage each other.Management set in their draconian ways.  Large contingent of IT managers should not be allowed to manage people.  If these IT Managers treated dogs like they do their people they would constantly bitten.  It is almost impossible to change jobs  internal posting are mostly just to check a box and say they advertised the opening  when they already have someone selected.  Constant political battles between managers make it very difficult to change to a jobs.Your manager will most likely have zero interest in your career.   I have yet to have a manager who asked me what my career goals are.Unfortunately, If you establish yourself as a dedicated, talented employee, you will be stuck doing repetitive work and soon hate your job. The more established you get, the more time you'll spend in endless meetings, which results in ever poorer worklife balance as you end up doing most of your real work after hours. Since most IT managers are technically incompetent you'll spend more time explaining and selling your work than doing it.If you forget to pay homage to the old boys club, you will never get assigned interesting work or a promotion. The office space is horrible. FMCC is filthy, dark and moldy. The renovations to open offices are a waste of money.    ITHQ BIC is awful  the new open office plan is atrocious.  It is impossible to get work done, even with blinders and earplugs.   The leadership keeps slapping themselves on the back and rolling the horrendous open office plan out to more and more buildings.The IT infrastructure is nearly always broken, but somehow is reported as 99.9% available.  The newer infrastructure is always failing, servers down, databases down, Hadoop unavailable or the data in bad state.  This makes difficult to test and deploy code as you must wait for availability.The reliable IT infrastructure technologies are being abandoned because they are not bright and shiny.  A lot of technology for technology sake.  Attempt to move everything to Pivotal Cloud Foundry with little thought of what business value is being provided.  Meetings are like a tent revival, where everyone is making the trek down the aisle to be converted to the Cloud.  Praise be, we had 30 conversions today."

I worked for 6 years as a Financial Analyst at Ford, and I had unparalleled professional development at that time.  The Finance function at Ford is one of the best in the world with decades of refined processes for budgeting and preparing business plans.  There is a strong emphasis on the management team of providing analyst level employees with challenging assignments and high standards of work product and professionalism.  Equally important is the emphasis on honesty and integrity, and I was never asked to modify any numbers in order to hit predetermined targets.   The skills I learned in Ford Finance are highly transferable, and continue to make me a better Finance professional today.Ford is full of talented individuals, and there are not enough management positions to develop of the great talent they recruit each year.  In order to distinguish oneself for promotion, one has to be willing to accept special projects, work long hours, and prove their loyalty to one's boss.  Once I left Ford, I confirmed what I had already expected; that Ford's talent pool is so good that they're expectations for promotion are out of line with the rest of the manufacturing sector.  A surplus of talent is a good problem for Ford, but can feel stifling for talented up and coming professionals."

Very smart, hardworking coworkers. Pay is good (not great) but you get a lot of side benefits.Very flexible work environment. Savings & stock matching is generous. Products are cool and interesting  Ford will have the best overall vehicle lineup in 3 years. Lots of regional offices across the country. Dearborn is ok, the surrounding areas in Ann Arbor, Plymouth, Canton, Birmingham and downtown Detroit are actually very nice places to live and commute from.Base pay is usually slightly lower than other OEMs. Health care is stupidly expensive (but that’s the case anywhere in the USA). If you have a bad boss they can stall your career. Management will often overpromise and underdeliver  ex: “tell us what you’d like your next position to be and we’ll support you.” 3 months later: “here’s a completely different job from the one you asked for, but we think you’ll like it too.”Company has a PR problem with explaining its plans.

"Jul 2, 2018",1.0,"BEWARE-Never give advance notice if you plan to leave I had a great supervisor and team.   They paid my relocation costs when I first started work for them.I left Ford when I was recruited into a better job offer, plain and simple.  I planned to give 3 weeks notice as a courtesy to my team that I still highly respected so I could help them transition a new team member into my position during a very busy time in the project cycle.  Beware, the day you give notice they immediately excuse you from work and cut you off no matter what date you list in your resignation letter.  It seems they have a secret walk out policy.  Don't bother giving notice until you're ready to leave the same day.  I lost thousands and thousands of dollars in retirement money that would have vested in just a week had they honored a 2 weeks notice.  I was promised two weeks additional pay and unused vacation in my exit interview and a month later I haven't received anything and have been trying for over two weeks to reach someone and find out what happened.  They send you to an email address that only responds every 45 days, and knows nothing. The person who gave me the promise never returned any of my calls until my wife called then emailed and referred me to the same phone number that knows nothing, well actually pretends to know nothing as I’ve called them enough now to get the feeling their responses are scripted.  They give a pretense of helping me and answering my questions but we are still back at square one after over two weeks and I’ve had to rephrase my question about ten times and they still don’t get it.  Ford touts how good they are at communicating but anytime I try to call and get information, no one knows anything (or maybe pretends not to) and I'm just referred to automated email addresses and voicemails.  Even as an employee we found out major company news from the mainstream news before they told their employees.  Horrible communication.  You can't find contact information anywhere to a live voice, probably on purpose.  I wanted to leave in a friendly manner but instead they seem to have made false promises and treated me like outsider scum so I've lost all respect I had for them which is really sad.  Thanks a lot Ford, it didn't have to be this way.  If you plan on staying there the rest of your life then maybe you'll enjoy it if you can handle all the lack of productivity and frustration that might arise when trying to work with union employees and if you don’t mind a bonus that seems to be only a fifth the size of what the union workers get, but if you ever have to make a career change, watch out for the Corporate beast and be sure to make sure all your own interests are in line before you leave.   Yes I’m bitter now, I’ve wasted so much time trying to get only what was promised to me and I wasn’t bitter when I walked in to give my notice or even when they walked me out the door although I was shocked. The last month of trying to work with completely clueless and incompetent Ford employees, policies and procedures has ruined it for me, zero customer service, and intentional avoidance. I’d be ashamed to drive a vehicle produced by a company run in such a manner and I can’t believe I worked for such a company, how sad."

Since I was hired as an experienced employee, I was given 3 weeks of vacation from the first day. There are a fair number of holidays and the week of Christmas holiday is pretty much an extra free week of vacation.Where do I start? Well, competitive pay and pay for performance isn't happening.  If Ford really wants to seriously contend as a mobility company and not another automotive manufacturer, it needs to seriously hire software engineers with real skill and experience, basically on the level of what a Google, Amazon, Netflix, or Facebook would hire and pay competitively with those companies. In fact, those software engineers will have to be probably better if they are going to hire for such things as Autonomous Vehicle, AI, and writing embedded software. Ford  management is still stuck in the assembly line mentality of hiring a bunch of lowskilled developers is better than a few really good ones and we can use project management, architecture,  and irrelevant bureaucracy and processes to achieve good outcomes. In fact, these outdated ways have been causing an untold number of unforced errors and have achieved little to nothing except mistrust from their business partners.

Low customer base which meant not to many customers would come in to buy cars. 8 hours could fo buy without a single person at your desk. The management bullied and degraded its salesmen, myself included. Ultimately shaved money from employees paychecks and would not give them what they were entitled to unless you fought them on it.

Occasional profit sharing.  The range of different types of positions is very diverse.Good, competent managers who treat their people fairly and equally are EXTREMELY rare. You WILL be mistreated here, not every day, but it WILL happen and more than once.  Many managers mistreat their people and those around them.  Discrimination, insults, intimidation, bullying, undermining people's careers are all fair game.  HR does nothing about it, the higher the rank of the manager, the less they will care.  Most incidents go unreported because it's common knowledge that HR will do nothing and there WILL be retaliation in some form.  This company only cares about their public image and how that helps them make more money.  Deep down they don't care one bit about having a happy and productive work force, profits come first.  Management ignores constructive criticism and feedback from it's employees.  Most coworkers have the same complaints you do but are afraid to speak up and rightly so, dissent of any form is not tolerated.  It's like living George Orwell's ""1984"".  All office buildings are old, crumbling and moldy.  The UAW is a pain to deal with.  They have fewer responsibilities, few qualifications and get paid more than most educated engineers.  The pay here is not great.  Hard work is rarely recognized or rewarded.   Promotions are awarded based on popularity rather than performance or competence.  Profit sharing checks are capped no matter how much you contributed to help the company this year."

I had originally stayed away from OEMs because I didn't feel that they had embraced technology fully enough, but I believe that Ford is making strides to become a technology company instep with its manufacturing past. Ford has an extremely positive outlook and will continue to become less susceptible to cyclical automotive changes as a mobility company. I am extremely excited for what the future is bringing.The vacation policy is really bad when compared to everyone else, and there's no flex time. Come on Ford, it's 2017! We're also forced to use our vacation over the July 4th week  how is that modern thinking?!?!Additionally, everything is done by the book which I believe to be a negative thing. Although there is a conscious effort to change this mentality and to become more agile, there is still a 'Day 2' mentality among many of the veterans as very few of them are thinking outside of the box, This is probably because very few employees have been exposed to many (or any) other work environments. Good thing? Bad thing? It's a doubleedged sword  people don't leave because Ford is a great place to be, but it also creates a closed system where ideas can't freely circulate. Lastly, I firmly believe that Ford can become more effective if there was not a fear of business tools. Yes, information is highly sensitive and we don't want information leaks, but Ford seems to hide from new and innovative approaches to managing data and encouraging efficiency. Leadership should push new initiatives for improving business efficiency."

As a nonsupervisory design engineer with more than 10 years experience, profit sharing will be approximately 6% or $6,000 based on 2016 profit of $10.4 Billion.  Using GM as a comparison, based on profit of $12.5 billion, a nonsupervisory design engineer will receive profit sharing of 1113% of base salary with a 165% multiplier or ~$23,500.

"Feb 8, 2017",1.0,"Ford Seating Dept Nothing worth writing about, anything you can get from Ford you can get from other OEMS like GM and Chrysler.Terrible work environment; dark windowless corner of the building.  Management continually likes to change expectations for deliverables or add deliverables that cannot be reached by designated milestones.  Very very difficult to deliver a program given the massive number of processes and rules that must be followed.  Expectation is you are available 24/7 (cell phone has to always be on).  They might say ""family first"" but the family they mean is the Ford family.  Almost impossible to get out of the seating dept once you are in; they will not let people transfer to other depts within the company without a fight and a lot of made up unwritten rules that have to be followed first (ie you have to have a manager's permission to apply for intercompany roles).  Career growth is stagnant, typically supervisors are hired in from outside the company instead of from within.  Salaried engineer bonuses are always less than what UAW members get and continually less than what other comparable OEMs (FCA, GM) get.  OT is available but trying to get paid for your extra time is difficult and must be preapproved, rules for OT are heavily biased in favor of the company (ie you must work 11 hours before you can book 1 hour of OT).  If you decide to work at Ford in seats, insist on a min salary of $100k, you will need at least that much to offset the tons of unpaid OT you will have to work."

There are only a finite amount of highrankings to award, so these are awarded to those with 25 years experience and nothing is left for employees under 30. Working remotely is not a serious option, no one respects it in the culture. Software used by engineers is extraordinarily outdated. Ford as an organization refuses to outsource any engineering tools, preferring to make and maintain their own versions. Case in point AVBOM: a tool designed to improve a legacy DOS screen (that somehow still gets used everyday...), instead of being a sensible software tool, is a visual basic macrofilled excel spreadsheet that works more slowly than DOS itself. All engineers must use this single tool for part number management everywhere in the company, despite its errors and limitations."

The PDC (Product Development Center was easy to access from many freeways.This was the worst experience working in the automotive industry I've had to date.  Design and engineering are completely at odds with one another and they prevent each other from achieving their goals on time. So every design project is late, rushed and done poorly.  Overtime is abundant, but the stress associated with finishing a project is too high a cost.  What eventually will happen is the project will again be delayed and you will find yourself working OT under the same stressful circumstances of design and engineering not making sound decisions.  The worst part is as a sculptor, you will get blamed for the inefficiencies by the poorly managed studio environment.  Meanwhile, when you glance around most coworkers are spending their time watching YouTube, pretending to work OT.  Any assistance with training or understanding their backwards system is nonexistent and the guys who have spent their careers at Ford treat you like a moron for not walking in and getting how things are done.  The employee culture there is mean spirited, bigotry is rampant and the good old boys mentality is preventative of positive and openmindedness .  The attitudes are archaic and they do not foster understanding towards family obligations. Most people will work a minimum of 12 hour days and many work Saturdays and Sundays.

First they said I would be working in the city in which I lived, then told me that the job was actually across the country, but that I'd be given relocation.  After being employed for 8 weeks, I was then told I would NOT be receiving the relocation package they promised.  After being employed for 10 months, my salary was reduced by nearly 25% because of an ""administrative error"" that they realized during an audit.  When I finally left the company, they did not pay me my final paycheck or my leftover PTO, at least not until I got a lawyer involved.  They also sent me 3 different versions of my W2, which of course created a nightmare when trying to complete my taxes.  I could go on and on..."

If you understand why things are done the way they are done here operationally, you will be a genius in operational best practices no matter where you go.Ultimately, the product portfolio and product strategy are nonsense and demonstrates a lack of understanding of cars, customers and profitability. Jac Nasser tried to fix this, but was crucified for it (partially, he deserved it, for taking a pure M&A approach). Alan Mulally took the organic approach and made operations bulletproof (it was so awesome to work there during his era), but he didn't touch product strategy."

"Oct 28, 2016",2.0,"Boring... Not stressful, stable pay, sense of family, as long as the company sells F150's and some other SUV's, we are cool.Boring, lots of old systems and processes, lots of bureaucracy and backstabbing, careless managers.The pay is steady, but the growth is super slow while your soul gets crashed.The Dearborn campus area is in general dull, kinda disgusting, very old and dirty. Some cafeterias are really bad (only pizza and burgers) and very expensive. They said remodeling is coming, but I guess by the time that happens, this place would be plagued by Indians, the only people that love this kind of environment.Lots of untalented people even though there is a very stringent online system that filters out lots of great local people so that in the end we end up with importing unfit, cheap labor, specially from India, who drag down our annual incentives and make our kids rethink STEM.I think bad decisions are being taken: a lot of investment in ""mobility"" and software, yet no clear path on how to execute that vision and generate revenue. A lot of dependency on trucks, yet we says its unprofitable to sell small cars. Toyota somehow is the number 1...Example, ""let's reduce the weight of the gas tank as much as we can, like paper wall, so that it costs next to nothing to manufacture"", ""let's add a fourfigure dollar software feature that nobody uses but looks cool"".No clear strategy on how to top Tesla in the EV world. Old roots seem to be too entangled to allow green innovation; maybe engineering politics have to do with it, along with cross ""favors"" from suppliers."

It has great potential for getting a new car, buying nice things and, living comfortable. Profit sharing, bonuses ,401k,and overtime it's union. Your job is protected somewhat. You can't find a decent job anywhere else that pays like this one. Be on time don't miss work. You get personal time.  A raise every year. Paid holidays.  It's really awesome as far as benefits go.It's hot hard physical work. No AC it is anywhere between 120 to 135 degrees in summer. You can wear anything you want in the main building but if you are in Paint or Body shop it's long sleeved coveralls and it is hot.  Winter it gets  cold but manageable. management dont treat you like a person you are a robot.

However, the profit sharing bonus (not guaranteed) and retention bonus (new contract every 4 years) make total compensation about $45k by the second year. Liberal time off. Paid vacation for 1 week shut down in July, and paid week shut down at Christmas. Outstanding medical, vision, and dental benefits package at ZERO cost for premium contribution by employee.Strenuous work environment. Wear and tear on the body. Manufacturing facility which is very hot in warm months. Standing for 10 to 11 hours a day. Break procedures to use restroom need improvement. Some waits are excess of 20 minutes. Poor employee morale and attendance. Treat employees like slaves at times."
"Jun 8, 2016",3.0,"Research Scientist In research, you're surrounded by very talented peers.  There's a strong management push for collaboration, so even if people on the ground aren't keen, you can always fall back on ""One Ford"" and find the right person to connect with.  research engineers are also paid pretty well, and benefit options are good. Lots of lower managers are accommodating of new ideas, at least in research.The biggest con is that most of us have no career prospects. No one ever gets promoted into management, period.  There's been a flurry of activity the last few months, but it's all targeted at pet projects or the current hot area, and it's mostly upper management shuffles.  No one from the general salaried ranks is getting promoted into even the lowest level of leadership.  we're all fairly wellpaid but depressed about how we're going nowhere.  but we've got families to support, and benefits are good, so what are our options?  it's a running joke between most employees, but no one is laughing.Ford likes to tout all the career resources it provides, like online training, assessments, etc, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you have no actual career prospects. and i'd say 85% of employees have accepted that they will never be promoted out of General Salary, not even after 30 years of service.Also, purchasing is cumbersome. You can't buy anything without going through like 4 layers of management.  Buyers will overrule your own order and resource your request so you end up with a lesser or incompatible item.  People buy inferior things or make shady repairs all the time because there's never any approved budget to buy the right tools."

I recommend getting in good with your supervisor and manager.  Be able to sell yourself even if you do not feel qualified. They will buy it, have strength in how you portray yourself. Focus on mirroring their style and you will go far.Not many cons other than trying to keep up with the ever changing political landscape is scary. If you are no longer their favorite, you will feel it and possibly be ostracized. Group mobbing is prevalent and affects morale when you see good workers outed. My advice: stay on the in.

Money is based off of your effort.Salesmen only make commission Therefore, a slow season means no money for salesmen. This may not be an issue for dealerships in high traffic areas...but for more rural locations, a slow season can be lethal. Example: January and February are the worst. Everyone spends too much during Christmas, therefore no one is looking to buy a car right after the holidays. No one coming into the dealership means salesman aren't getting paychecks. The salesman who have enough clientele from years of working there might have a few 'repeat customers' come in to buy from them, but usually a slow season is bad for everyone. Also, the dealership doesn't drug test (at least the one I work at) they say they 'might' in the paperwork but they never do. This is a big problem when you out know management is doing drugs on the premises. Management at my particular dealership is crooked... That's not every dealership though. If sales stayed more consistent, I would have no reason to leave. But with a second child on the way, I need more consistency for my family...

Led by a terrific senior leadership team, the company is evolving to meet the consumer and employee demands of today and tomorrow.Since the company was created by Henry Ford, where he instituted the $5 minimum wage  unheard of at the time  the business has given its employees fair wages and provided hundreds of thousands of everyday people the means to become part of the middle class.Given the numbers of years that Ford has been in the business, many of its facilities are outdated and do not align with the expectations of the new generation of employees. These settings can be a  somewhat of a 'buzzkill' and inhibit creative and innovative thinking the business wants. Although the executive leadership team is pushing for greater transparency, openness, and acceptance doing things differently, many middle manager are still stuck in there conservative habits of formality and nontransparency. This lack of acceptance is an impediment to the evolution of the company in this new era of 'mobility'."

Do not expect a career at FORD!!!!Zero training and orientation provided for new contract employees, and are expected to deliver as if you have 10 year experience working in the company. Processes are very cumbersome, and any engineering change you try to make, takes ages to go through. Gigantic size of company and, poor process flows and red tape are a major problem. Nobody in the company can explain the exact process when consulted.Company does not want smart and intelligent contact employees, but only workforce that follows given orders. Do not expect you can put in new ideas and innovate at Ford.Management is very crappy. Projects are shuffled every 6 months, so you got to hand over and take over new projects. Projects are literally dumped on you. This leads to complete loss in tempo, and have to start from scratch.Engineering Data, reports and history is not carefully documented and stored in database to retrieve by new people.

After being placed in a work environment that was filled with several ""Good Old Boys"" who all had an unbelievable hatred for anyone with a different sexual orientation, that team worked very hard to make my life as miserable as they could during my term with them, including stealing from me, tampering with meals that I brought to work, openly making hateful jokes and remarks about gay people, and making repeated efforts to get me terminated.  Well, finally after I was struck by an individual with a large ""Mag"" flashlight, and because I simply pushed him away from me in an attempt to prevent any additional strikes to me, my career was stolen from me, and my life has been ruined as a result.  Not only were the ""Good Old Boys"" active in the efforts to rob me of my career and future, but every supervisor that was in charge of my work area worked closely with them in their efforts.  It took them about four years to achieve their goal, after all, my work record was exemplary, and only after defending my personal safety were they able to finally find success for their efforts, the local UAW, and my committee man would do nothing to correct the gross injustice that was done to me.  I can tell you that, although Ford Motor Company makes claims that they value diversity, and work to create an all inclusive work environment, the fact is that on the ""shop floor"", there is no real effort to attain an allinclusive, nondiscriminatory workplace.

Ford is constantly brainwashing employees during their mandatory trainings, orientations and ""allhands"" calls.  It seriously felt like I was in a cult worshiping the great Lord Ford. Ford tried to steal my bonus.  They literally stole the money from my bank account after I left the company even though I was eligible for the bonus and worked extremely hard to earn it."

Also, contractors are not paid any more than Ford employees even though they receive none of the benefits that Ford employees do even though they are doing the same job.  It's nearly impossible to get a raise because Ford considers contractors as ""hired guns"" who are hired to do a single job.  The reality is that no one there does only what they were hired to do.

"Dec 11, 2014",2.0,"Low-quality engineers and treats people like children Ford offers employees the ability to rotate into other parts of the business (and even requires this for college graduates).  They offer tuition assistance, a patent rewards program and some unique benefits (ie. use of Ford lawyers for certain personal cases).Leadership seems to be a huge problem within my organization.  Nobody wants to take charge to make a product truly excellent, people just want to coast by without doing any hard work.  A week stuck in meetings is a successful week to a lot of these people, even if no quantifiable work gets done after all the meetings.Ford treats employees like children.  Employees have to go to mandatory hourlong ""trainings"" that basically tell you not to post confidential material on social networks and not to accept bribes from customers.  IT sends out emails like ""Cyber Steve learns about safe Web browsing"" with a picture of a little cartoon IT guy telling you to use a secure password.  It's insulting to be a professional engineer and having people treat you like a child.Another big problem is Ford promotes peopled based on how long you've been with the company instead of the quality of your work.  This leads to, for example, an IT employee being promoted to supervisor of a production software team just because he's been at Ford the longest.  These are just two different worlds and they don't mesh well together, which is why some of these production products are a disaster.  People should be promoted based on the quality of their work, not for how many years they can sit behind the same desk.I have yet to meet someone at Ford who understands the difference between good software and bad software.  People seem to think that if ""it works"" then it's good software and the project is good to ship.  No!  That is absolutely wrong!  Just because the software works in a blackbox test environment doesn't mean it's robust, readable, flexible or maintainable.  Some of the software I've seen has been an absolute nightmare and my superiors refuse to let me make it any better because ""it already works"".  Come back to me in 5 years when you have to make a change that becomes impossible to implement and tell me ""it works""."

Work hours are very flexible, lots of autonomy,  there is no micromanaging at all. Managers/ supervisors are so approachable and willing to help its ridiculous ( I am a new hire and know a few higher level managers and can email them or instant message them anytime and they always respond and are very helpful). Pay is competitive, benefits are good. It's a very big company, so work/life balance fluctuates depending where you go, but for the most part I'd say its pretty good. Plenty of opportunities to travel all over the world, I was almost sent to Spain for 2 weeks within my first 4 months of working. Ford gives you from a little before Christmas to a couple days after new years off as part of just holiday time off, not part of your vacation. So this is an additional like 2 weeks of paid vacation, on top of your vacation days (HUGE pro). Its an awesome place to work, I have been very pleased.Michigan is gorgeous in the summer, but is a very gloomy cold place in the winter. If you don't like the cold or are not used to it, this is a big con. Detroit isn't as bad as most people think, but there are some sketchy areas (some incredible ones too). In some departments (crash and safety engineering for instance) work/life balance is not good. For most people, during 4th of July you are forced to use 4 vacation days.. this sucks because you only get 10 your fist couple of years. Facilities where you work are very dated and ugly. Makes for kind of a gloomy environment.

Some great managers and employees.Other positions / departments are more satisfying then this machining department. I am told by many it is one of the most difficult.UAW protects employees who need it (do not do their jobs). Some of upper management can not or will not back the process coach in debate against the UAW. Most union operators and Trades are very unmotivated and if the Process Coach pushes them to work they will find a way to do less and then report the Process Coach to labor relation for offensive behavior. So for example if upper management sends the command that all operators must clean their operations then Process Coach goes to all Operators and says ""please clean your area better before the end of shift"" the operators get together and decide they will all go to labor relations at separate times and report offensive language or aggressive behavior on the process coach, who is then disciplined. The process coach training does not cover much of the actual difficulties of the position. If the operators want overtime they can and will find a way to stall production so weekend production is scheduled. Weekend production is only an issue because the Process Coach is only paid their base pay no 1 1/2 or double time for mandatory overtime. Managers are known to schedule meetings before or after start of shifts requiring employees to  work unpaid over time every day.Salary are required to present projects they have never seen before because they are not involved in the projects. Due to the tremendous amount of work load they have they do not have time to work on projects, leadership knows this but it is easier to force an unfinished report so the presenter looks unprepared."

While there's a great push for work/life balance (relaxed dress code, alternate work schedules, very few supervisors ""watch the clock"" for your coming and going, etc), it's clear that the higher you go up the food chain, the more you're expected to give up.While each department runs like a welloiled machine in most regards, crossdepartment interaction can be tenuous. Everyone is very disciplined in their skillset, but the various processes and structures don't mesh well in other areas. This creates confusion, gaps in timing and understanding, and animosity among some players. It doesn't help that upper management, at least from an IT perspective, doesn't seem to be willing to push too hard to help remedy these problems."

People are paid well for their work. Benefits are solid. Working for a Fortune 10 company is always good on a resume.The politics, especially on the communications team, are unbelievable. Half of your time will be spent walking on eggshells as not to upset anyone and to stay on the good side of a few management team members so you can actually accomplish anything. The company claims to have a creative mindset where ideas are welcome, but that only applies to those ""in"" with senior leaders, who may turn on you quickly.  People here learn to be experts on what leadership wants, not experts on social media or PR, which means there is a lack of creative, groundbreaking work. Teamwork is not encouraged or celebrated.

Old automotive culture and politics make it hard to work with other people.  Everything moves slowly. Management isn't willing to change anything, including the crappy buildings and working conditions.

Pay is good and so are bonuses.There are still some employees that cling to the past Ford culture and are slow to change.  It would be good if IT leaders promoted more of an Go Fast To Go Further mentality so I could respond faster to business requests.

I have looked at a job at a bank in Pittsburgh and top of the salary range was 30K less than I was making at the time.They have profit sharing. Management has the option to lease vehicles with unlimited mileage and includes insurance.   The only other thing I can think of is that they allow you to telecommute one or two days a week and provide alternative work weeks such as 4 10 hour days with a day off.Very political.  Not a lot of cooperation between groups.  Really no career path. They seem to favor the systems engineers in distributed and server support. In twelve years only one mainframe engineer was promoted to a technical specialist.  Lots and lots of bureaucracy and process.  For example,  to obtain a server,  you have to go through 4 different processes,  one of which, took a year to get approved.  Lousy work environment.  Very dirty.

Sometimes women are given a hard time when they take maternity leave, or try to utilize the worklife balance policy. No one will admit it, but there is still a boys' club at the top. The most successful women are the ones who pretend they aren't.Your experience and opinion of the company can vary greatly depending on your supervisor. I have had two really great supervisors and one that makes me want to leave the company today. Lack of training. They are trying to change this, but it's a hard culture to change.There is a ridiculous amount of paperwork. Nothing gets approved without upper level management signing off.Cross functional interaction can be tense at times.Many of the tasks are simply exercises in pushing numbers around."

"Sep 25, 2013",3.0,"Thoughts on the FCG Program FCG (Ford College Graduate) Program allows you to get hired from college and get great insight into the company by trying out 3 yearly positions (rotations).  You get to try out positions you pick.  You may pick almost anything you want, but with some controls.  i.e. not all Ford positions are available.  Only those whose manager is open to having an FCG work for them.  Also, if two or more people vie for one position, only one of those people gets it.  The rest go with their 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choices.FCG Program gives you a way to evaluate Ford and for Ford to evaluate you.  FCG Program allows this to happen much faster than if you were hired directly into Ford outside of the FCG program.  The Program also gives you opportunities to move fields on a whim, where otherwise you would more likely stay in your general chosen area.FCG program is there to try things at Ford, but one can potentially overshoot themselves and fail.  i.e. it is possible to select a position you are not qualified for and currently there are no controls to avoid that situation. This is on purpose.  You get to try things at Ford, you pick the positions, and it feels like you are in control.But you need to be mindful that while you are selecting and working your positions, Ford management and HR watch your performance levels and if they drop too low, may take action.  HR trumps FCG Program.That means you cannot truly ""try a position"".   You need to use care in selecting your rotations and you need to be able to do the job well, or else you may find yourself being released from the program and back into the wild.  FCG advisors will guide you, but they will not always caution you on your selection, or be able to help you when things get really tough.Not all rotations end up being the way they were stated on paper.  For example, a highly technical role may end up being doing research on a software package and putting together a software configuration document.  Or a technical developer role where you expect to write code may end up being a usability analyst where you do research instead.A lot of roles are ambiguous, because Ford work is ambiguous.  There is lots of overhead meetings & paperwork, to figure out what to do, and things change, so it is natural that some positions end up not matching their written description by the time you get to them.  Sometimes roles change as you are working them, and you may find your position description change quite a bit.  In the same vein, being a large company, Ford management moves around.  Sometimes you find that managers change or leave, as you get to your position, but that is more rare."

Also, I have never worked for a company where people respected their CEO as much as Ford employees respect Alan Mulally. He is a great leader and a genuine person who has done a tremendous job at bringing Ford back to being a market leader.As with working with any large corporation there can be a lot of hoops to jump through. In particular if you need anything done by IT you have submit a work ticket and then wait forever  for it to actually get done (if it does not get lost).

Initial salaries are competitive and bonus and profit sharing is good.Ford has refused to staff up to the levels needed to support the business.  It is almost abusive the amount of work that is placed on employees at all levels of the organization.  When a large number of the senior leadership team left during the downsizing in 2009,  the culture of the Company did not transition to the new leaders.  The leadership team is focused on the success of the business at the expense of the workforce.  The Company is making large profits but employees are still purchasing their own stationary supplies due to the level of approval required to purchase pens and paper.  Also, the compensation programs will force early  career people to leave after only a few years if they hope to grow their salary.  With only a 2.7% merit increase in most years, someone would have to leave the company to keep their salary growing in hopes of building enough personal wealth to retire someday. ""Fire me I need the raise"" can not be more true. Continues to be a very conservative company that manages by committee so that no one manager is accountable.....very difficult to get things done."

You may have contributed outstanding accomplishments to the firm, but if your boss is not willing to actively support you in front of his personnel committee then you will go nowhere!The backbiting finally go to me.

You start in a rotational program, so you get to move to a different area every 18 months. They also will pay for parttime MBA programs, but you are required to work at Ford for 2 years after completing that.Living in Michigan is the number one downside for me. If you can get past that, another downside is that there is little opportunity for career advancement. The company is still far too top heavy and moving from Analyst to Supervisor is not easy and generally takes an MBA and 8+ years. There are many people who work at Ford who are basically incompetent and getting paid $90K+ year. They have been there forever, are still Analysts and will never become Supervisors.

Loose, illdefined job descriptions act as enablers to some rather unfair treatment.  Sometimes, after someone (generally female)  leaves a general salary roll position, the job, without any change in content, is then reclassified as low level management and a ‘chosen employee’ (typically male) gets the newly reclassified job.  Clerical work also gets disproportionately allocated to women.  Ford has work/life policies that look good on paper, but these policies are sometimes administered unfairly by middle management; a ‘wrong’ reason or misplaced inquiry about the ‘transitional work arrangement (an optional part time work program, which is offered to allat least on paper)’ can result in a voluntary package.  The new performance review system results in some employees being labeled “low achievers.”  Instead of attaching a label to employees, why not label their job performance?Ford is figuratively a different company depending on what division you work in.

"Jan 13, 2010",4.0,"Works you hard, but can be rewarding! Despite being over 100 years old, Ford is an up and coming automaker with a bright future.  Its really nice to (finally) receive all the positive press and gain respect relative to peers in the industry.  The executive management team is talented, bold, and willing to make difficult decisions.  The strategy set forth from Alan's team is clear and spoton  profitable growth from a global productled revolution.  And the top management really make an effort to inform employees about certain topics regarding the company which would not normally be known.  The company offers very competitive benefits and salary, and have policies in place for very flexible work schedules and arrangements to help support worklife integration.Hours can be long.  The consecutive years of rightsizing the company have cut the employee base to the bare minimum necessary to operate.  Thus we're all working very hard.   Some middle management at the company needs improvement  especially related to lack of leadership.  Sometimes it seems they want to pass the buck to the upper management and let them decide everything.  Also promotions have been rare recently, and probably will be for the near future, so career development is stalled."
"Jan 13, 2010",4.0,Decent place to work Good work life balance and decent pay.If you are a top performer this probably isn't best place for you since most promotions are based on connections rather than performance.
"Jan 8, 2010",4.0,"Okay but not great for high performers The pay is decent if not great for Michigan.  Most employees are quite loyal and invested for the long term.  Most employees are fairly good at what they do.  Management among the top C level managers is great and consistent.  Good product strategy (currently).  Alan Mulally saved the company.Middle and lower level managers are hit or miss.  They can be completely terrible.  There is absolutely no leadership, no accountability, and no consistency with these lower level managers.  Ford pretty much wants you to get married and get a house and family so that you don't consider leaving.  Once you are in it is almost impossible to get fired so you have to deal with low performers a lot.  Promotions are based 100% off years of service as opposed to performance.  Communication across groups such as digital marketing is nonexistent.  Managers can be eager to hear about concerns but will do almost nothing to find a solution.  What may take 2 months to do at a small or mid sized company will take at least a year at Ford.  Shifting priorities.   Micromanagement is terrible and there is absolutely no checks or balances on it.  There is no opportunity to move around in your job or advance because the company is not growing."

Most people at all levels truly care about one another's success.  Ford Motor Company leads the rebound of the automotive industry, and it's exciting to have a role in the turnaround.Recent economic pressure has led some employees to fear for their jobs.  When people are driven by fear, political jockeying and sharp elbows prevail.  Some lower and mid level managers have adapted to having smaller teams by digging in and working alongside those who report to them, while others still feel it is only their job to ""manage"" and babysit, not to contribute in any meaningful way.  Ford is still quite management heavy, leaving little opportunity for promotions or growth opportunities."

Ford strongly believes in rotations, so you will see many aspects of the business. They are also very strong believers in worklife balance.In IT, you will have the opportunity to work with just about every platform imaginable, on a scale found few other places. Ford still does almost all of its IT internally, so very little is outsourced. Information Security is an especially strong area of Ford IT.As with most large companies, things move slowly.

"Nov 3, 2009",3.0,"Not A Bad Place To Work, But It's Not For Everyone In addition to offering competitive salary and benefits, Ford offers a professional experience unlike any other you will find. If you work in Vehicle Operations at any facility in the Ford system, you are exposed to a very fastpaced environment that maximizes your ability to multitask and to make decisions on both inductive and deductive reasoning. Your leadership skills and fortitude will be constantly tested. Because the company annually ranks in Fortune's top 20 companies, Ford's size and scale makes your resume stand out to prospective employers.The constant tension of dealing in a union environment can be debilitating. If you are a creative professional, you may find yourself consistently stifled by the framework of the labor agreement and the overall environment in which you work. In summary, Ford offers challenges that do not necessarily require a technical expertise or advanced degree in order to excel. Just thick skin and a willingness to endure an onslaught of repetitive, banal tasks.Also, because auto is a mature industry and Ford has been in business for over 100 years, growth is limited. Promotional opportunities are limited thanks to several years of salary staff reductions and those that remain are holding firm to their jobs in the tough economy. However, if you are afforded the opportunity to accept an assignment that takes you to Dearborn, you have to ask yourself if you really want to spend any portion of your career in Detroit."

In accordance with my skill set, I primarily worked on internal webbased application development.  Overall, I appreciate the experience I was able to gain there, although like most IT jobs, the position had its trials and tribulations.The two supervisors at the Houghton office are great to work with and the manager is very flexible about scheduling.  Assigned projects are based on experience and skill set, though almost all work is grounded in either Java or C++, with any database and/or web design knowledge being a big plus.  Pay was very good compared to most other opportunities in the area, and there were even a few fringe benefits as a mere supplemental employee.Communication with the rest of my project teams in Dearborn was sometimes a struggle.  Getting everyone together for a phone or video conference was tough, so email and wordofmouth were heavily relied upon, occasionally resulting in gaps.  Most people I was in contact with were cooperative and helpful, though a few strays needed a kick in the pants from their respective supervisors.Ford employs many thicklyaccented foreigners, which can sometimes compound communication issues.  Patience is simply the key in those situations.Opportunities for significant advancement are unlikely in the shortterm, with the auto industry the way it is.  Still, I thought Ford was being competently run during my time there, and its revitalized fleet of products should position the company to enjoy any sort of economic turnaround, should one come in the near future."

Most manager positions would qualify for senior level management responsibilities in other companies.2) The sales and marketing career track rewards a broad based, generalist knowledge of both the sales and marketing career diciplines.  You must be sucessful at both to suceed!3) Managers at Ford are flexible and adaptable, due to a previous culture of being reassigned (promoted based on merit) and the willingness to relocate.   Seasoned employees are comfortable with a certain amount of unplanned activity and readily adapt to meet challegenges and support the business.4) Starting out, you will get an opportunity every 23 years, to a) learn a new job;  b) make a contribution; c) move forward, based on performance.  Jumps between starting levels (GSR) are small and very reachable.  It is easy to see the next step and work toward that target.   You have great managers and coaches to help you.1) Promotions and professional development are stagnent at mid senior level (MR, , SC & PSR) levels.  The same employess who excelled and survived at the first levels get sent to Dearborn and  rot in the same (or similar) job.   Promotions are extremely limited.2) The executive level is very difficult to join.   There is a ceiling.  3) Anyone with an advanced degree should only consider coming to Ford if you can join one of the leadership programs. The company won't reward you or consider you for an executive position otherwise.  4) Death by a thousand cuts....  In Dearborn, Ford has cut about 42,000 employess  (from c. 60,000)since 2000.

Within Product Development specifically you have the opportunity to work on next generation vehicle programs that are in the corporate pipeline.  Product Development at a car company is much more interesting than most as you're developing highly visible products that truly add value to people's lives on a daily basis as opposed to a component supplier, or consumer products company where you're making slight changes to existing products.  You have a great chance to truly drive organizational change and an incredible opportunity to work with not only cross functional groups (Marketing, Planning, Engineering, Purchasing, etc) but also other organizations such as Corporate and the Customer Service Division.Some of the downsides include the lack of respect for one's personal time from operating management.  While the overall time spent at work varies drastically from Finance job to Finance job within Ford, PD Programs and Engineering management are very demanding and often times call meetings early in the morning (7 AM) and late in the evening (6 PM or later).  Also, the amount of meetings in a day is simply incomprehensible.  Often times one can spend 7 hours a day in meetings in PD Finance. Once again this will vary and likely be less in other Organizations within Ford."

Decided lack of integrity among many of the ""old school"" employees, those who grew up with their daddy and grandpa working in the industry and think they are entitled to ""perks"".

Hiring Alan was the best thing the company could have done.Working for a company that doesn't make money is not easy  so far in 2008 the raises which should have been effective April 1 were delayed to October 1 and other benefits were also cut (life insurance for retirees, tuition assistance, etc).  However, starting salaries are competitive."

Decent pay and benefits, but they have scaled back over the past 56 years so I don't know how new employees would view the packages.Automotive industry is slow and risky.  Big bonuses or big layoffs.  In engineering, there's not much 'engineering' going on.  It's mostly the suppliers that do the 'real' work.  Most engineers are miniproject managers of sorts.  The culture is pretty stagnant...there's not much/no feedback or changes from Pulse Surveys and many people feel like they need to watch their back or not speak up since it's a culture of being judged in your performance review if you stand up for what you think is correct."

Very talented workforce.Poor overall performance of the company has trickle down effect on professional development and career advancement.

No one invested in the furture. They let the goverment and countrys outside the US walk all over them. Now they are tring to catchup by getting rid of all ther experanced people because they are are cutting cost. Who is going to run this Company? New hires from Mexico or China.

The Blackbelt program was good until they downsized it and blended it into the rest of the company. Oh, and the company is downsizing every month so getting a job and keeping it would be a challenge."
"Sep 3, 2008",3.0,"good place to work if you don't mind being part of a shrinking company The best reason to work at Ford Motor is to be a part of a 100 year old company with the heritage that comes along.  If you have a passion for automobiles this can be a great place to work.  Not many other companies produce exciting products like Ford can and does.  Dearborn can be a great place to raise a family.Eroding market share makes everything difficult  budgets are always being cut, no more extras or small perks you may be used to at other companies, and a logjam of qualified people who have been waiting for promotion longer than you."
"Aug 29, 2008",3.0,Ford has it's challenges Big company experience. Challenging industry provides interesting opportunities. You will likely be able to work on some significant projects as the company attempts to re invent itself. There is a need for a lot of analysis and decision making (although decision making is only done at VP / Director levels).Don't go into your job thinking that you will make a difference. Ford is a large company and it is also very tall and top heavy. In many departments there are an equal number of analysts to supervisors and supervisors to managers. This tends to limit the upward mobility within the company. Also the company has just gone through a few rounds of layoff eliminating people at the bottom. Another issue is the continual benefits cuts. Every year the company cuts more benefits. They are not in a situation to give bonuses either.
"Aug 20, 2008",3.0,"Help!?!? Longevity, motivated to be flexible and compatible with business climate.  Family focused goals.  Leader in environment preservation and conservation.Bureacracy, too many bosses not enough people actually working.  Unfair employee value system."

When the domestic auto industry was solid it was a great place to work.It's so big and clumsy there is a tremendous inertia to change.  The last 3 years most everyone was afraid of losing their jobs they either did nothing or tried to stand out and get noticed it created what I call ""bad behavior"" and drove wasteful ideas and programs out of despiration."

"Jul 14, 2008",4.0,"Family owned, tries hard, but still has a long way to go Overall, Ford still believes in it's people and to a certain extent, the extended ford ""family"". It tries it's best to put people's work first, offering good benefits, some tuition assistance programs, flexible schedules/work days (4 day/10 hour) despite economic hardship in the industry. Some of these programs have probably been axed due to budget cuts, but even despite it's size, the management is still family operated.Unfortunately, the industry is just not a growing sector. The American automotive sector is on the decline, of which there are many reasons. The large bureaucracy/organizational structures created in the 50's stifles risk taking, creativity, and innovation. Also, the outdated concept of the UAW (Note: research nonunionized plants in the US owned by foreign competitors, BMW/Toyota, and how much more nimble they are to adapt, esp. to flexible manufacturing)."

"Jul 12, 2008",4.0,"The future is looking quite good. Ford Motor Company is one of the largest manufacturing firms in the world and is #7 on the FORTUNE 500 list for 2008. Just a few years ago, it was madly profitable and the owner of such renowned brands as Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Hertz. Sadly, those days are over, the stock price has plummeted from its peak, and thousands of white and blue collar workers have been laid off.However, while the North American segment has suffered, Ford is experiencing tremendous success in South America, Europe, Russia, and Asia and the mass exodus of management talent appears to have stopped since Alan Mullaly came over from Boeing. Although the company appears to be in terrible shape at the moment, there is great promise ahead. With the transition to global vehicle platforms in the near future, new vehicles will look and feel the same across all continents eliminating the constant yearning in the US for the European variants of the Fiesta, Focus, and Mondeo cars.In addition to their Escape and Mariner hybrid SUVs, Ford is bringing to market new Fusion and Milan hybrid sedans in 2009 and will start selling brand new Fiesta and Focus small cars (on the global platform) in 2010. With the new Flex, MKT, F150, F100, Mustang, and Taurus appearing soon, the product mix will certainly become more diversified and much more competitive.Fuel prices are killing the auto industry at this time, but Ford has chosen to invest in proven technologies like 6speed automatic transmissions, electric power steering, better aerodynamics, lighter materials, etc. that not only improve fuel economy, but keep the cost of the vehicle reasonable.Mulally has made some difficult decisions, but if Ford can weather the storm these next few years, they will come out stronger, leaner, and better than ever. So although the current climate may be glum, they are poised for sure success in the next decade.With very little capital sitting around to spend on refurbishing office spaces, buying new printers and more powerful computers, providing office phones and cell phones to the workers, and other such niceties most employees expect to enjoy, the office environment, at least where I work, is nothing special and actually quite outdated.There is very little budgeted for travel expenses, so in times past, when engineers needed to head to another factory for a couple of days, they are now confined to Southeast Michigan and teleconferencing. The money is also especially tight when it comes to computer upgrades, getting office phones installed, or getting a work cell phone. For new workers, it's basically impossible.In the past two years, more than 30% of the white collar work force has been cut, so this naturally leads to diminishing morale and more work for the lucky ones who are left. As well, the parking lots and office areas are a bit more empty, too.For those predisposed to dislike hierarchical management structures, staying away from Ford would be a must. There are layers upon layers of supervisors and managers stuffed between Mulally at the top and the entrylevel engineer at the bottom. Starting from my position on the bottom rung, there is a section supervisor, an area supervisor, the executive engineer for Automatic Transmission Operations, the North American Director of Powertrain Operations, the Group Vice President of Manufacturing, and then the big cheese, CEO Alan Mulally who technically reports to Executive Chairman Bill Ford, Jr."

Other than that, I do not believe there are any good reasons to work at Ford.Ford is a dying company.  It has been downsizing since 2001.  It is looking to cut costs everywhere, which means it hasn't given a pay raise to anyone in over 2.5 years and it has slashed benefits.  When I joined the company out of college, they recruited me on the following platform: ""Come work for Ford and we'll pay for your MBA at an evening program in the area, such as U of M.""  Well, I started the program earlier this year, and Ford suddenly discontinued their tuition assistance program, telling us we could just drop out of school if we couldn't afford to keep going.  I was promised a promotion back in April, and then it got delayed until July, and then until this upcoming October, but now it might simply be canceled altogether.Ford used to be a great company.

Inefficient systems and processes balloon in size while number of employees and staffed functions dwindle.  Typical older, larger company issues ... lots of history (has always been done this way) with marked differences in perspective.

Over time, Ford will become less of a family legacy business, to a results driven business that doesn't mute strong leadership and drives differentiation from the competitors.

If the first person does the job wrong, the next will have problems.Some of the downsides are that performance has little effect on the way you are viewed and advanced.  Senority is key.  The work on the body is strenuous and wears it down.  Employees are also given too many opportunities to keep their jobs.

The worst problem is that higher management does not know what it is doing.  Every 12 years, there tends to be a new mantra for higher management.

"Sep 7, 2021",1.0,"Degrading work for the desperate or the dead inside Some international travel. Although probably not anymore.Pay is pretty poor. Even back in the day didn't pay as much as Holden.Design office runs on gullible contractors who take on heavy loads in the hope of getting employed. Which can take upto 67 years.Staff on the other hand put their feet up and hang out for either package/retirement/cushy jobs in the satellite teams.Replacement D&R Engineers get progressively less experienced, come with less and less technical background, which feeds the brain drain leaving the design office.D&R role is no longer an Engineering job. Just admin/paperwork. Internal spreadsheets/tracking sheets/analysing costs endlessly leaves no time to engineer.D&R role impossible to escape internally. Transfers are not outright rejected, but they say you need to find your own replacement for your job (knowing full well that no one will ever volunteer to go into D&R role).Blame culture throughout, particularly between budget stripped departments who fight each other like dogs to earn the praise of the overlords in Finance.Moral at rock bottom. Few meet up socially. Very few take pride in their work and nobody cares except to avoid being given tasks and avoid blame. This leads most people to pretend they know nothing about anything. Most common answer to any statement in any meeting is ""this is the first i've heard of this""."

"Mar 27, 2019",3.0,"Great Co-Workers, difficult position. The manager of the customer service dept. was fantastic. A very approachable, understanding & outgoing person. didn't feel like a traditional ""boss"". Most, if not all of the staff in the other departments were very nice too.The money is good, for a customer service position.The position itself is very difficult, being spoken to in an aggressive, rude & insulting manner every day undoubtedly has a negative affect on a person. There was little to no room for upward mobility, there didn't seem to be any option to move up the ranks. If there had been, I could have seen myself sticking out the job for another while, in order to move up. But that doesn't seem like a great way for Ford to hire the best people.Upper management are stuck in the stone age in certain ways. Having to start from the bottom and do a job you hate for years, in order to get a position that is relevant to your degree/field doesn't make any sense. It's more a test of your patience, rather than your proficiency to do the given job. Some people in upper management are there simply because they've worked there for X number of years. Seems backwards. Also, a small thing but does sitting at a desk answering phones all day really require someone to wear a tie? Come on, reprimanding people for not wearing their tie in a job that isn't client facing? Get real."
