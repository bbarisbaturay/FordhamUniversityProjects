0,"November 17, 2020",5,Awesome workplace  I enjoy my job at Toyota. It is a great opportunity to work with great people and meet new clients.  You are free to work hard and get your job done I would recommend. 
1,"December 1, 2021",3,Good company but not great Good company but it doesn’t have a life balance and very stressful work. Breaks have to be exact. Micro management. Customer surveys doesn’t represent the service a representative provided.
2,"November 23, 2021",3,"Decent opportunities, very set in their ways. This company portrays that they are fair on the outside, but if there is an issue it never gets resolved. They stretch their BD manager too thin, that he is not able to assist with the department. Pay is decent, but rules on what you should get paid on and what you don't are confusing. "
3,"November 20, 2021",5,Finance manager Great company actually in my 22 years in car business the best company I ever worked for if you can get a job there take it.. I will always enjoy my time at this dealership 
4,"November 20, 2021",4,Schedule There is a rotating schedule. You will work 2 weeks on night shift then two weeks on day shift and then repeat. There are paid holidays and scheduled shutdowns in July and December. 
5,"November 20, 2021",2,"Could be better Pay could definitely be better. Management has a hard time maintaining staff and it will make you work longer hours when someone quits. Besides the staffing issue, department management is excellent, affording you freedom and flexibility. However higher management will be abrasive."
6,"November 13, 2021",1,Bonus program  Upper level management is very political.   Toyota culture under American leadership has declined to the point of ineffectiveness.   Too much emphasis is placed on union avoidance and not enough for the welfare of its employees.   Tenure and seniority are not valued by the company.  Promises made are not promises kept. People are treated like cattle. 
7,"November 12, 2021",2,"Management is terrible, This is the worst company that you would ever want to work with the management is horrible they do not consider your outside family medical needs you do not get appropriate time off you do not get medical leave management do not speak to you in the morning supervisors are horrible they do not allow you to ask questions about what needs to be done it's just a terrible place to work."
8,"November 11, 2021",2,Fun coworkers but management is HORRIBLE Great easy going light work environment. Fun to work there & the pay is nice but it’s not what is promised during the hiring process. Long hours & high expectations from poor management. 
9,"November 4, 2021",2,Lack of opportunities Not able to move internally.   The work load is excessive.  Management not clear on scope and direction.   Managers will not lead or develop employees.
10,"October 27, 2021",3,Not too great not too bad.  Glad I left. Didn't work there too long.   Seem to advance those who were close to or related to the Upper management.   Puts younger managers in with lack of experience.  
11,"October 26, 2021",1,"Coworkers are great but Management is sketchy and unsupportive Working here was always being Micromanaged by supervisors and had a lack of belonging. If you ever had to call out sick or ask for vacation time it was always frowned upon. Even if by some miracle you got approved they would make you feel almost guilty. If you work hard and above and beyond expectation, they don't appreciate it. The only thing that made working here tolerable was the outgoing salespeople."
12,"October 24, 2021",1,"Repetitive manual labor that will break your body down Toyota on the outside, loves the community. Their name pops up and their logo is everywhere. They give thousands to the community. Paid Millions to have the Trash Pandas stadium named Toyota stadium. But the bonuses that are part of your yearly wages have gotten smaller and smaller each year. It’s so small, it’s sad. You will NEVER get used to the 2 week swing shift schedule. It will take years off your life and you will HALF of your families lives. Promotions are easy. All you have to do is put your time in and pass a test on computer. That person is promoted even if they’re not qualified. Even if they can’t run as many stations as a regular team member. People love the title but have no place in a leadership role. That goes for Team Leads, Group Leads and AM’s. Quality issues are examined and studied and parts are put on hold. But somehow always get released and approved even if they don’t meet criteria. Quality over quantity does not exist. Upper management makes poor decisions when it comes to the safety of all team members when weather conditions are bad. Your sick time is part of your PTO. They are so short handed because so many team members are out on medical leave. So apparently that’s easy to get approved as well. People are gone for months at a time or 2-3 days a week. While lines are left short handed and management pulls team members from other lines to get that number. You may only get 5 mins of training. Yet, another quality issue! Be careful when choosing to work for a company of this size. Your eyes will be opened."
13,"October 23, 2021",3,Its ok .  No room for improvement or growth within the company.  Temps being brought in and spit out every few months .  Management was ok for the most part . Wouldn't go in expecting to be there long . 
14,"October 23, 2021",5,"Good place to work  Fun place to work when busy. Slowed down while I was there but that was more the economy than the place of business. Potential to make a lot of money or nothing, just depends on how hard you work."
15,"October 21, 2021",5,"Great Work Environment Awesome work environment and very good, was very happy there and it was nice to be there and it was good to be there and very good and so forth and so it is said."
16,"October 21, 2021",3,Unorganized environment  The salary is low and you will be working on a comission structure. Upper management can't make a decision and will always be changing rules. They will make you feel like trash if you're not going in to work extra time on your days off. The owner will tow employee's vehicles if they are not parked all the way to the back of the lot (very dangerous for those who work night shifts because the parking lot is pretty dark)
17,"October 19, 2021",1,technology uncertainty with the management team led to poor decisionsnoisy environmentdifficult managers were trying to force decisions on the rank and file and led to friction
18,"October 19, 2021",3,Good pay but terrible work schedule. The pay and benefits at Toyota is very good. The work schedule however is awful. You have two weeks on days then two weeks on nights. It makes it so that you never feel good.
19,"October 18, 2021",5,great company Great company. Great people to work for. Employees are treated with respect. Much room for advancement within the company. Even the customers are wonderful. 
20,"October 17, 2021",3,All about the money Toyota is one of the wealthiest companies in the world. They do this by having an eight year grow in to achieve top pay. Over the last 15 years my insurance has skyrocketed; pay doesn’t keep up with inflation. Turnover is absurd! When a company of Toyotas stature pays recruiting bonuses there is a problem. It’s all about the numbers. You never know when you will leave. I advise to look elsewhere; much easier jobs for similar money
21,"November 17, 2020",5,Awesome workplace  I enjoy my job at Toyota. It is a great opportunity to work with great people and meet new clients.  You are free to work hard and get your job done I would recommend. 
22,"October 16, 2021",5,"Great company and manufacture.  Loved working for Toyota. Amazing company, great  reliable vehicles. So easy to learn all their products and systems. Hands down the best car manufacturer around. "
23,"October 14, 2021",1,Bad workplace The pay is very good but the management doesn’t really care about you if you have a wedding be prepared to miss it if you have family going advance be prepared to miss that as well
24,"October 13, 2021",4,"Faced paced Dealership If you like to work faced paced and wanna show off your skills and knowledge, then go for it. company will send employees to get trained at Toyotas top notch training facilities. "
25,"October 10, 2021",2,Terrible management This place will steal your soul...you are nothing but a number to them. And manager will throw you under the bus..if it was a good place to work the turnover rate wouldn't be what it is..and they have trouble getting new people in the door
26,"October 9, 2021",2,"It’s above average for a car dealership  The pay plan changes every few years, lots of long hours including nights & weekends. Management can be negative. Great location, customers & product. "
27,"October 6, 2021",5,"Good place to work Great place to work for anybody, advancement options although they can have some favoritism. Cheap breakfast and lunch. Management is great no complaints."
28,"October 4, 2021",1,Management doesn't care about their employees  Management doesn't care about their employees. You are not treated as a human being but just as a  employee number. I had a complaint that I wanted to speak to the G.M. of the dealership & I was told he was busy in a meeting & couldn't speak with me about it. I could clearly see in his office that he wasn't in a meeting & just didn't care to speak with me as a customer having a complaint. I will NEVER EVER give this dealership any of my hard earned money & would warn people to STAY AWAY !  
29,"October 3, 2021",1,"Unorganized management In certain departments I was under payed, no bonus for extra skilled work completed. No benefits were offered. I worked outside in the heat and no water was offered. Not worth the time if you are planning to live comfortably. Management does not tell you important things related or happening within company. For example after a covid outbreak..certain employees were not made aware(including myself). No PPP offered and mask mandates are not properly followed."
30,"October 3, 2021",1,"Terrible atmosphere  Terrible place to work the general manager does not know how to treat sales people. Poor pay they make you work 50-60 hours  , does not support sales people "
31,"October 1, 2021",1,Worst dealership in the industry  Rude staff from the team to the managers. Horrible pay. So let commission with ZERO flat rate like most dealers. Numbers that must be met are way higher and demanding then any dealer I’ve worked for. The management is SO rude. They treat u like dirt. Micro manage the life out of you. Shifts are way longer then 10 hours. But the worse is how they treat u.  I’d rather be broke and homeless then employed by them.  Good riddance 
32,"September 30, 2021",2,"Writers can sell, even stuff customers dont need.. but lots of freedom and great place to start Typical shop politics you need to follow. Unspoken rules, if you anger a writer or deny work because youre busy, guess what? sh1t work the rest of the day, or no work. The freedom you have over yourself is nice and you arent really being supervised but you really need to be able to bow down and lick the writers boots because theyre the ones handing out work and you dont wanna be on their bad side. Management only cares about you if youre one of the top earners, very clear favorites."
33,"September 28, 2021",3,"Great money, but expect to work A LOT It’s pretty straight forward. I liked the money, but wow are they willing to treat you like absolute garbage. The GM’s are willing to yell at you and every threaten to fire you over simple mistakes. The work/life balance is harsh. You work at least 50 hours a week and they will ask you to work a lot more. In fairness, the more you work, the more opportunity to make A LOT of money you have. This is an environment where everyone is expected to put up big numbers. They do give you a decent amount of training, but be ready to do your own research/training at home. When I was there, my smallest check was around $3500 in a month. That’s with the absolutely terrible numbers. If you can talk to people, be excited doing it, and work a lot of hours, you can do this job. The money is worth it IMO. Only left due to personal reasons."
34,"September 28, 2021",5,"Love it here I am currently a receptionist but I’m switching over to sales because it’s more suited for what I’m going to school for, but I loved being a receptionist! The other receptionists are so warm and welcoming, and the management treated me like family. It was nice for me to do my school work (as long as I did my work too), and when things got hard in my personal life they were all there for me. They are very understanding with schedule conflicts and important issues. Definitely would recommend you work here. "
35,"September 27, 2021",5,"Good product, people, customer base, company, co-workers Enjoyed working with this orgination. They appear to want to do good buy there customers and employees. There reputation in the community appears to be solid. Good customer. Stong customet retention. Employee s have a good attitude. "
36,"September 26, 2021",2,"Stay away If you enjoy spending time with family.....then this is not the place for you. There's overtime but most likely they will tell you the day of, and expect you to stay with no regards to if you have kids or appointments and if you leave you get points. Huge seniority issue, even if you are a hard worker it doesn't matter...no one gets promoted into management, they encourage you to move outta state to their other locations for positions like those oh and training sucks.There way of training needs a huge remodel because they are obviously stuck wayyy back in time. Again this is for Toyota production warehouse not Toyota dealerships. They only good thing about working here is pay and benefits.Do people even buy Toyota's anymore? After working here I no I wouldn't."
37,"September 26, 2021",1,I felt very beat down most days . My immediate supervisor didn’t want to take the time and energy to train me. One of the owners was very cold and unfriendly. The sales & service people were awesome though. 
38,"September 24, 2021",1,"The pay does not equates with the job task  Most of the daily tasks were difficult to complete, and it is a fast pace assembly line work; it makes it very easy to make a mistake with the part selection. The weekly pay should be more."
39,"September 22, 2021",5,No flexibility It’s an ok job if you don’t want to have a life or if you consider work life. Benefits are great but if you have a family it’s a deal struggle. To make matters worse they don’t care that you have a family they just want to make money.
40,"September 22, 2021",2,Good job at the beginning but it’s like working a dead end job  The work itself isn’t hard whatsoever but management is horrible and very very immature and petty. The union isn’t very helpful benefits aren’t all that great either. 
41,"September 22, 2021",5,Great opportunity for people who want to work. If your a desk jockey this is not the place for you. Diversity in the work place. Great training and flexible hours. Your patience will pay off when its time to move up the ladder.

66,"September 14, 2021",5,"Good place to work Are you looking for a career that is both physically and mentally demanding, requires you to master multiple skills, and work as part of a close-knit team?Production Team Members are integral to every process, building in quality at every step of the manufacturing process. Standing, lifting, bending, and reaching are part of many tasks. You must also strictly adhere to standardized processes and procedures to ensure the safety of your teammates, the quality of your work, and the timing of production.

High demands come with high rewards, including competitive pay and benefits, and the opportunity for promotion to Team Leader, Group Leader, Assistant Manager and beyond."
67,"September 14, 2021",5,Good company Overall great company. Management works well with you. Have the opportunity to make more money with overtime or you can do your 8 hours and go home. It can get very hot but you know this coming into the job so it's expected. 
68,"September 13, 2021",2,"It's an okay job so start with service. Management will be nice at first, but you'll see that they are not organized. Management does micromanage a lot and will expect you to do whatever they ask you without giving you a raise or even show any appreciation. The coworkers made it less stressful."

70,"September 11, 2021",2,Run If you want to be stuck on 1 process all day after telling them you're hurting or in pain from doing the same movements for 10 hours a day then this is the job for 4 you.  They care more about getting the number than your health.  
71,"September 10, 2021",3,"Great place to work at if you're starting off in sales. Toyota is a great place to work to get your foot into the door of the sales world. However, I would not recommend it for a long time. Management (some) only see you like numbers, and you have a lot of pressure on you. It is a great job if you are young and would like to drive different types of cars, and learn how to build and maintain customer relations."
72,"September 8, 2021",4,"Great benefits but hard job You would think that a company such as Toyota was more advance in their technology, but it’s pretty behind in the times. With their recent upgrades on their app and website, it’s caused more headaches for the customers. Long hold times due to shortage of employees and Toyota’s inability to have certain back of the houses processes more streamlined - make CSRs job, at times, impossible to execute as they are only able to do so much. The benefits of working for toyota are wonderful. Just a really hard job as toyota works out their behind the scenes issues. "
73,"September 4, 2021",2,Ok workload distributed based on engineers working 60 hour weeks; good news is that overtime is paid in addition to base salary!constant travel every week - with expectation to transit all the way to 10pm;
74,"September 2, 2021",4,Good place to work Good place to work. Good benefits. Good security. Alot of overtime at different points of the year. Management could be better but thats a factory for you. 
75,"September 2, 2021",1,Poorly managed and high turnover Poorly managed service department. Always understaffed because they hire unreliable people who call out all the time or quit. Everyday at work is chaos. Salary and commission numbers are not made available to you to verify your being paid correctly. 
76,"August 31, 2021",3,"Never a boring day Work hard and you reap the benefits. I got to be in a commercial once, so that was cool. My boss made me laugh every day and it helped on days when customers were mean. "
77,"August 29, 2021",5,"I love it! I love working here. They are clear about objective that they are trying to reach and gave a purpose to it. Overall, it's a great place to work and I really can't think of anywhere besides here"
78,"August 28, 2021",3,Productive and fun workplace I learned a lot but there wasn't a lot of movement for my position. My manager let me do my own thing but there wasn't a lot of direction. Seemed like you had to know people to move up.
79,"August 27, 2021",4,"Good if you want to hustle  Typical day at work is prospecting, taking walk-ins. Good management depending on with sales manager you get. Very family like environment but a lot of drama and annoying salesman/finance managers. They definitely want you to make the most money you can, so its easy to get burnt out. Hardest part of the job would have to be being the bad guy to customers when you tried so hard to earn their trust. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be making money while your there or else its a waste of time."
80,"August 26, 2021",3,Decent place to work Average job with average pay. Work life balance could definitely be better. Benefits are decent. Pay is average. Grow in is way too long. Don’t get used to having days off cause they can be taken away at any given time 
81,"August 25, 2021",5,Good work place  Very good work place. Flexible hours and management that will work with you. Very honest company. They take pride in their work and it shows very well. 
82,"August 24, 2021",1,"UnProfessional/Instant gratification Don’t think about this job, if you even want to call it a job. You get no support, no training, no understanding. This place is far from professional, even though the people try to make it out to be. You don’t get any lunch breaks!! If you do eat you have to swallow it whole.Forbid if you get a deal and you trying to eat. You will not eat!!! Deals are push and not put together correctly. Missing key items to help the process move smoothly and the the same time you are getting hammer/ pressure to hurry up,. The sales team is very unprofessional!! Very rude and belittling. No smiles, but Constant badgering. No one on the sales team, mind you, that has been there for 15+ know to operate finance, but will rush you to hurry up so the customer can come back to your office. The upper management are very short and rude with you.The hours are terrible/ridiculous!! They close at 10:00, but will try to close a deal if they walk in 30 mins to 15 til. It take at least an hour to talk to the customer out front to see where they interest might be. By the time a deal is done it’s already 11/12. No family life. Kiss that goodbye. The sales team are only out for their self. I never in my life seen a place so unprofessional, disorganized and rude/ uncaring in my life!!! It’s not worth your sanity.No smiles and no one you can approach with a concern. This !!! 8-10 are insane hour to work 7 days a week. You ask a question from upper management and it seems like they ALWAYS want to be belligerent. "
83,"August 23, 2021",1,Terrible management  The management is rude no respect for anyone and terrible people to work with. Not worth the 12 an hour rate. The lead receptionist has a lot of issues 
84,"November 17, 2020",5,Awesome workplace  I enjoy my job at Toyota. It is a great opportunity to work with great people and meet new clients.  You are free to work hard and get your job done I would recommend.

87,"September 14, 2021",5,"Good place to work Are you looking for a career that is both physically and mentally demanding, requires you to master multiple skills, and work as part of a close-knit team?Production Team Members are integral to every process, building in quality at every step of the manufacturing process. Standing, lifting, bending, and reaching are part of many tasks. You must also strictly adhere to standardized processes and procedures to ensure the safety of your teammates, the quality of your work, and the timing of production. Production positions require you to work either first or second shift. Daily and weekend overtime vary based on business needs. High demands come with high rewards, including competitive pay and benefits, and the opportunity for promotion to Team Leader, Group Leader, Assistant Manager and beyond."
88,"September 14, 2021",5,Good company Overall great company. Management works well with you. Have the opportunity to make more money with overtime or you can do your 8 hours and go home. It can get very hot but you know this coming into the job so it's expected. 
89,"September 13, 2021",2,"It's an okay job so start with service. Management will be nice at first, but you'll see that they are not organized. Management does micromanage a lot and will expect you to do whatever they ask you without giving you a raise or even show any appreciation. The coworkers made it less stressful."
90,"September 12, 2021",4,Ok Was not what I thought it would be. Maybe if we had better manager and stuff jt would be more smooth s lot if people were messing around on the job for the most part 
91,"September 11, 2021",2,Run If you want to be stuck on 1 process all day after telling them you're hurting or in pain from doing the same movements for 10 hours a day then this is the job for 4 you.  They care more about getting the number than your health.  
92,"September 10, 2021",3,"Great place to work at if you're starting off in sales. Toyota is a great place to work to get your foot into the door of the sales world. However, I would not recommend it for a long time. Management (some) only see you like numbers, and you have a lot of pressure on you. It is a great job if you are young and would like to drive different types of cars, and learn how to build and maintain customer relations."
93,"September 8, 2021",4,"Great benefits but hard job You would think that a company such as Toyota was more advance in their technology, but it’s pretty behind in the times. With their recent upgrades on their app and website, it’s caused more headaches for the customers. Long hold times due to shortage of employees and Toyota’s inability to have certain back of the houses processes more streamlined - make CSRs job, at times, impossible to execute as they are only able to do so much. The benefits of working for toyota are wonderful. Just a really hard job as toyota works out their behind the scenes issues. "

96,"September 2, 2021",1,Poorly managed and high turnover Poorly managed service department. Always understaffed because they hire unreliable people who call out all the time or quit. Everyday at work is chaos. Salary and commission numbers are not made available to you to verify your being paid correctly. 
97,"August 31, 2021",3,"Never a boring day Work hard and you reap the benefits. I got to be in a commercial once, so that was cool. My boss made me laugh every day and it helped on days when customers were mean. "

99,"August 28, 2021",3,Productive and fun workplace I learned a lot but there wasn't a lot of movement for my position. My manager let me do my own thing but there wasn't a lot of direction. Seemed like you had to know people to move up.
100,"August 27, 2021",4,"Good if you want to hustle  Typical day at work is prospecting, taking walk-ins. Good management depending on with sales manager you get. Very family like environment but a lot of drama and annoying salesman/finance managers. They definitely want you to make the most money you can, so its easy to get burnt out. Hardest part of the job would have to be being the bad guy to customers when you tried so hard to earn their trust. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be making money while your there or else its a waste of time."
101,"August 26, 2021",3,Decent place to work Average job with average pay. Work life balance could definitely be better. Benefits are decent. Pay is average. Grow in is way too long. Don’t get used to having days off cause they can be taken away at any given time

This place is far from professional, even though the people try to make it out to be. You don’t get any lunch breaks!! If you do eat you have to swallow it whole.Forbid if you get a deal and you trying to eat. You will not eat!!! Deals are push and not put together correctly. Missing key items to help the process move smoothly and the the same time you are getting hammer/ pressure to hurry up,. The sales team is very unprofessional!! Very rude and belittling. No smiles, but Constant badgering. No one on the sales team, mind you, that has been there for 15+ know to operate finance, but will rush you to hurry up so the customer can come back to your office. The upper management are very short and rude with you.The hours are terrible/ridiculous!! They close at 10:00, but will try to close a deal if they walk in 30 mins to 15 til. It take at least an hour to talk to the customer out front to see where they interest might be. By the time a deal is done it’s already 11/12. No family life. Kiss that goodbye. The sales team are only out for their self. I never in my life seen a place so unprofessional, disorganized and rude/ uncaring in my life!!! It’s not worth your sanity.No smiles and no one you can approach with a concern. This !!! 8-10 are insane hour to work 7 days a week. You ask a question from upper management and it seems like they ALWAYS want to be belligerent. "

176,"July 14, 2021",4,"Focused and consistent It was a great work place for me. My job as a parts Inspector was easy enough. Your constantly working and focused. I went through a temp service for $12/Hr. But plenty of O.T. and mandatory O.T. on every other weekend. 2, 15 min. Breaks and 45 min. Lunch. Weekly pay. Strict and fair work environment.  "
177,"July 13, 2021",5,Great pay and benefits Really great pay and benefits.   They have a gym and 2 cafeterias.   They have a very safe and comfortable work environment.   They have tuition reimbursement and a lot of extra perks.
178,"July 13, 2021",2,"Poor Culture The culture is bread from the top down.  This dealership is part of a multi-store group based out of Florida.  All of the dealerships are money machines.  They are extremely busy with extremely high turnover in every department.  The turnover could be better but everyone is made to feel insignificant to the overall success of the dealership.  The on-site owner/gm has a habit of making off-color comments to people that would probably be better left unsaid.  The hours the store is open will tell you everything about how much they care about their employees.   Even though you might have the opportunity to make a good income, I would shy away from an opportunity there.  "
179,"July 12, 2021",1,You lose your familiy time. You get injured there within 3 yrs after you've been there. They dont care about you. Very depressing If you report wrong doing. You are concidered a trouble maker. You have to obey or you will be blackballed. Don't recomend to decent people. Ot fir people who need to keep.out of trouble in life.
180,"July 12, 2021",2,no diifferent than any other factory. just like any factory. the work is ok but could be way better. you got your complainers. and you got those who are entitled. hardest part of the job is going into work. most enjoyable part is going home.  
181,"July 11, 2021",3,"Great benefits,good people, management... Benefits and people are great,but management can be hard to deal with at times, some departments have under qualified managers that only care a on pleasing the guy on the top, by adding unnecessary work to the job. They will not listen to people with experience...Always asking for your opinion, but will tell your your wrong..Good place to gain experience.If you work hard, you will have more and more work.Until you find a better job, if your good, they will make you an offer to stay, otherwise, stuck for ever on the same thing.Diversity of people backgrounds makes if fun place to work."
182,"July 11, 2021",4,Its good  It's a good company to work for. Life and work balance can be hard sometimes. You have the opportunity to move up if you'd like or stay a team member. 
183,"July 11, 2021",2,"Pay is good no time for home life Management does not care about employees, just the production. There isn't any work and home life balance. Pay and befits are great, but your home life suffers."
184,"June 30, 2021",2,"Hard Work, Good pay If you dont have a family and you a dedicated to working hard you might like it. You dont leave till the quota for you line is met, be prepared to work mandatory 12hr shifts everyday. Most Sat are mandatory as well. Some of the staff and employees are ok, but you have some that act stuck up. If you are a temp, you get no personal days off, they threaten to fire you no matter what the situation is."
185,"June 28, 2021",1,Not a good place to work Everyone is disgruntled and hates each other.Place is run poorly.Managers are unprofessional and talk about one another to peers and staff.Overall bad. Worst place on the planet.
186,"June 24, 2021",2,"Good Hard workers, poor management  Worked here for two years and gained lots of friends with all the hard working people at the bottom of the pyramid. Management is poor and view everyone as replaceable. I only received a raise after a year and a half after threatening to quit when there were no other workers left. No A/C in the shop even on 100 degree days. "
187,"June 23, 2021",4,Good place to work Good job so far and great benefits and pay but you have to be willing to put in the work. Rotating shifts is going to take some getting use to but is manageable.

Talking to HR is like talking to the whole business office because your personal business would be aired out to everyone. Didn’t even feel comfortable talking to any high-up managers because they don’t do anything to truly help your situation. If you have a conflict with a coworker , instead of bringing in the both parties involved, they just take one side of someone’s story and run with it without talking to the other person involved at all. All this workplace is good for is gossip which is really unfortunate.

Nothing is really different from me being a new person with 3 months of experience to having 2 years of experience. Management has favorite sales people including the General Sales Manager he has 2 favorites. There are no fresh leads all leads I got were people who bought cars from 2-5 years ago. I got a total of less then 10 leads that were in the market for a car in my entire stay at Thousand Oaks Toyota.  Phone pops are only for specific people. I can go weeks without a phone pop. Some have a phone pops everyday.  Some managers put you down. For example I have closed deals on my own and the managers do not believe me and have someone go out on a deal just to make sure it was closed. When I close a deal it feels good but when a manager says are you sure and send someone else out to see if thats what the customer wants it sucks. They do not want to help you grow as a person just put you down so they feel better about themselves.  They hire people who steal deals from other people. Currently they have 2 people that do that. Some places fire people who do not follow rules for the 3rd time. This place its a free for all managers just do not care. Some managers laugh when you tell them someone stole a deal.

They used me for all of my experience and knowledge. Customer surveys dictate you future. They are a pass or fail based survey so even one star less then a 5 will mess up your growth. They have really dumb survey criteria's like facility and waiting area. So if someone gets cold coffee/cookie or runs out of TP in the bathroom, that effects the advisor for some reason. How is that the advisors fault? False promises the whole time of things like new software or better pay. If you make the dealership a lot of money, you barely make any of it for yourself."

The current Corona Virus situation has opened my eyes even more on their lack of care for employee's well being and that profits are more important since they decided to stay open even after the other auto manufacturers decided that it would be best to shutdown operations.

If you can break into the the good ole boys club then things would be easy, as with any large company there are always internal politics. But I throughly enjoyed the support of my co-workers, my boss and my team. Over all in my experience Toyota ranks first in my career experience, I have worked for a  few  fortune 500 companies between coast to coast, of all those places Toyota stands tall. Too bad moved to TX, and I was not able to relocate to TX during that time due to my family commitments. I am open to work for Toyota again If I get a chance again in the near future."

You get what you put in. Fast paced and fun at the same time. The pride you get knowing you’re putting out a vehicle that people depend on. Only downside to this job was the rotating shifts every two weeks between days and nights. I was missing a lot of family time.
1463,"September 25, 2019",5,fun place to work - great team effort you do need to concentrate on selling preventative maintenance as Toyota makes a good vehicle that doesn't break down as often as some other vehicles. sales need to be generated by performing fluid exchanges and tires and brakes.
1464,"September 25, 2019",5,"Porter Very good first job for someone who wants to learn about cars. learn many skills, also you get to know a little bit more about our city and its surroundings"

1466,"September 25, 2019",3,Keep looking. They don’t care for you Management is sad  Get use to being verbally abused by management and only family members get promoted to higher positions  the hard workers get nothing
1467,"September 25, 2019",1,Not really worth the hours Worked at other Toyota dealerships out of the area and this one by far was my least enjoyable experience. One of the desk managers will make you gross the rest will pencil it all out to move a unit if they are behind the pace for the quota. Pay plan is below average. Packs on new and used are the highest I’ve ever seen. They believe in this sales process that’s similar to every other process. They mystery shop sales associates to check the process.

1471,"September 30, 2019",1,"Receptionist at Toyota Direct I typically assisted potential buyers in finding a sales person for business. In the slower moments I registered temporary tags for vehicles that were purchased, as well as took phone calls and transferred them to the appropriate place."
1472,"September 30, 2019",2,"Terrible management, no room for growth This is a job where management cares very little for their employees. There is zero work/life balance. Don't get used to any of your coworkers because they come and go very quickly. They fire people without warning or people leave because they are treated so badly. They will lower your commission rate at a moment's notice so only work there if you can survive on salary alone. And be prepared to stay in the same position until you leave the company."
1473,"September 30, 2019",5,i loved this job Its great place to work. great people money good and plenty of overtime nothing to hard but not to easy. I love this job its a great place to work. the mangers some time have bad attitudes but its great overall.
1474,"September 30, 2019",4,"Good people good pay check Only 2 shifts. 1st and a 2nd/3rd shift To get it first is a 10 yr wait. 2nd shift is 430-1or 3amIf you have small kids or want to see your family this isnt the job. Its great money. Easy work. Good benefits. But the hours are really rough on family life. 85% of ppl are divorced in the first 3yrs there."

1476,"September 29, 2019",1,Parking attendant The thing that sucks about toyota valets is that they hire lazy people. It gets really busy at times and all they do is chill out and take there time. It’s sounds cool and stuff until management gets into your case and starts screening at you but not the lazy people to hurry up. The other thing is that there’s a lot of favoritism. If the supervisor hates you or something he finds a way to mess up your time sheet..
1477,"September 28, 2019",5,Great Side Job The work day is a lot to get used to sometimes the work is fast-paced and you're moving quickly and other times you're standing around for twenty minutes.

The ""next"" shift comes in at 6 am/pm, so unless something else is going on, you won't be there past that, but your ""shift"" ends at 3:15 and more than likely you will see the next shift coming in.

1550,"September 11, 2019",1,"Good pay and benefits, DO NOT work in Assembly. Toyota overall is a very good company that offers competitive pay and benefits. The overall company has a strong promotion-from-within culture, but expect to be on night shift in order to move up the ladder. The vacation time is generous and the plant shuts down for a week in July and December. I worked on the chassis line in Assembly in Plant 1, one of the hardest and most labor-intensive places at this particular facility. The work time (aka takt time) per process ranged from about 54 seconds to 72 seconds during my time there. The culture is very toxic, many of my co-workers were very unhappy and most of the direct management seemed to not have interest in changing that. Being a manufacturing plant, the work is fast-paced, and is solely focused on ""keep the line running"". Safety and quality is secondary to achieve a consistent operational rate of approx. 94 to 96%. Many of my co-workers who had only been there a few years underwent some sort of corrective surgery due to the work they were doing. I would not suggest working at this facility unless your in any other department. Assembly is the worst possible place for someone with a family, it will be difficult. Please reconsider applying for this facility unless you know where you will end up."

None of the jobs are hard. Most jobs are minimal effort. The work is quick paced and requires being on your feet. You could be walking 10+ miles a day depending on the department.

1561,"September 16, 2019",3,Laid back work environment I'm not sure why exactly this is making me write a review about my current job or even who will see this. I've worked at my job for the past 4 years now. They do treat you like family which can be both a good thing and a bad thing.
1562,"September 16, 2019",4,I learned a lot from them You will certainly learn how to negotiate and if a T.O is needed you will get one. You can make a great income as long as you are willing to put in the time.

1568,"September 12, 2019",4,"Great benefits in an environment with many legacy systems The type of position you are looking for within the company will likely determine your level of satisfaction working there.  Technology specialists will find the legacy systems to impact their work significantly, while customer service and collections workers (as well as leadership) may find the work to be similar to most call centers.  Benefits may be the company's strongest competitive quality, especially for those looking to lease vehicles."
1569,"September 12, 2019",3,"You WILL earn your pay... You MUST get certified for each position within your process. If you don't, they MAY move you or just fire you, when starting out you work for a temp agency, so more than likely you will get fired.The schedule rotates every two weeks from days to nights and eventually you will not want to do anything but work/sleep/eat and repeat.You WILL work overtime... almost daily, so don't plan ANYTHING at the end of your ""real"" shift, because you're gonna be late. The ""next"" shift comes in at 6 am/pm, so unless something else is going on, you won't be there past that, but your ""shift"" ends at 3:15 and more than likely you will see the next shift coming in. Plan on SOME Saturdays. You may not always have to work overtime, you may be able to get out of it, but not many times before you don't work there anymore.""Attendance"" is key to you staying on."

1571,"September 11, 2019",1,"Good pay and benefits, DO NOT work in Assembly. Toyota overall is a very good company that offers competitive pay and benefits. The overall company has a strong promotion-from-within culture, but expect to be on night shift in order to move up the ladder. The vacation time is generous and the plant shuts down for a week in July and December. I worked on the chassis line in Assembly in Plant 1, one of the hardest and most labor-intensive places at this particular facility. The work time (aka takt time) per process ranged from about 54 seconds to 72 seconds during my time there. The culture is very toxic, many of my co-workers were very unhappy and most of the direct management seemed to not have interest in changing that. Being a manufacturing plant, the work is fast-paced, and is solely focused on ""keep the line running"". Safety and quality is secondary to achieve a consistent operational rate of approx. 94 to 96%. Many of my co-workers who had only been there a few years underwent some sort of corrective surgery due to the work they were doing. I would not suggest working at this facility unless your in any other department. Assembly is the worst possible place for someone with a family, it will be difficult. Please reconsider applying for this facility unless you know where you will end up."

1634,"August 24, 2019",2,"Reasonable job with unreasonable management My experience with Toyota was an average and seemingly fair employment opportunity. The issue that became apparent within a few weeks was the blatant favoritism. Often I would be neck deep in work only to look up and see that all my coworkers were nowhere to be found. More often than not they would take unlimited smoke breaks and have no consideration to the other coworkers who don't smoke and would face more work alone. The issue became more prevalent when management would clearly look the other way when some employees made mistakes or were not doing anything productive. All the while when I would make a mistake or take too long on a job I was often brought into the service manager's office and yelled at. My job was constantly being threatened and later on the service manager decided we were now janitors who had to clean the filthy break and bathrooms. I refused and so did some of my coworkers, which in turn earned us a greater negative bias with management. It truly wasn't a bad job and I honestly enjoyed some of the labors and learning opportunities, but sadly that was vastly overshadowed by problematic coworkers and one of the most immature and unprofessional service managers I've ever seen."

1650,"August 28, 2019",2,"Stressful, low pay and turning very corporate from family own They have losses a bunch of good people working there in the passed 2 1/2 years( as of 2019), and they have been replace with people would don't know what there doing or you have to hand hold them through it so you can get your stuff done (ex: multiple people do not do anything regarding their timesheets, and someone else has to do all the work in paperwork then enter it twice a month) we've ask their manager to talk to him about it but refuses to write them up for not doing their job duties when they refuse to do it but ""their not about that"". The current morale of the dealership is pitiful to ok (at the best of times) with little being done about it. This used to be a wonderful place to work but they just start cutting to many people and corners, workers talking about the owners about to sell the place or talking about leaving do to the culture. Some manager do care there just can't do anything..."
1651,"August 27, 2019",1,Car sales You are not in control of the sale.  You just show the car but are compensated based on sales. Great for someone who has no experience and needs a in but no a great environment for experienced sales person
1652,"August 27, 2019",2,Poor Ownership The ownership is absolutely horrible.   Always butting Into sales deals with no clue as to what was going on.  They had little respect for the management and even less for the employees.  Many customers even saw this and noted they wanted to give their money elsewhere.
1653,"August 26, 2019",1,Sucks It’s in who you want to kisses up to on how well you treated. There is no Communication from management to you. Very poor work environment no one seems to be happy working there. Most will tell you they are there just for a paycheck and don’t care much about anything else like  Quality. And you work over time every day!
1654,"August 25, 2019",3,"Fast Pace and Competitive Computer systems for this dealership are easy to maintain and very user friendly. Staff and salesmen are generally nice and easy to work with. The paperwork is endless but if you like to file you're perfect for the job. The only con is that depending on environment/location, staff can be extremely petty and unprofessional."
1655,"August 24, 2019",2,"Reasonable job with unreasonable management My experience with Toyota was an average and seemingly fair employment opportunity. The issue that became apparent within a few weeks was the blatant favoritism. Often I would be neck deep in work only to look up and see that all my coworkers were nowhere to be found. More often than not they would take unlimited smoke breaks and have no consideration to the other coworkers who don't smoke and would face more work alone. The issue became more prevalent when management would clearly look the other way when some employees made mistakes or were not doing anything productive. All the while when I would make a mistake or take too long on a job I was often brought into the service manager's office and yelled at. My job was constantly being threatened and later on the service manager decided we were now janitors who had to clean the filthy break and bathrooms. I refused and so did some of my coworkers, which in turn earned us a greater negative bias with management. It truly wasn't a bad job and I honestly enjoyed some of the labors and learning opportunities, but sadly that was vastly overshadowed by problematic coworkers and one of the most immature and unprofessional service managers I've ever seen."
1656,"August 23, 2019",2,good benefits you have good benefits if you get hired on with the company.  pay is good once you reach top pay. sometimes you may work a lot of overtime.  some departments work can be very hard on your body.  if your lazy you won't make it in this company.

Management is bad and the turnover is high, let’s get that out first. They are constantly going through managers. They work on a roll it out and deal with the consequences later. You are constantly thrown through loops, system not working, manager doesn’t know what your doing because they never worked your job, something breaking etc. You’re always micro managed. You’ll feel like you’re not doing enough because they put you up against other people to calculate your production. It does have its perks, pay is great, benefits are amazing, coworkers are what really make it enjoyable. They also encourage you to take on another role and cross train, but don’t pay you any more than what you already make. You’ll be doing someone else’s job on another floor who makes more than you, but you’re still stuck with the normal pay you started with. Get ready to do work that is not in your job description. They also push that you can move up in the company, which is only slightly true. You can move side to side, but rarely do you see a floor employee moved up to a higher position. It’s more higher positions moving to another position on the same level. They also hire more than needed, and then work is scarce. You’ll be angry at what you see, complain and have nothing done about it. They are also asking about boosting moral, but they won’t budge on what really brings down moral... the constant tracking of production against team members. I could go on, but in a gist it’s a good first job and you’ll make it just don’t expect much."

However balancing a night shift job which starts at 715 but you need to make sure you are ON TIME so you need to leave around 530 which leaves no time for your family except on Sunday because youll sleep mostly all day on Saturday.

1840,"July 13, 2019",1,Sucky place Worked here for a couple months. They charge you for every little mistake. The desk managers talk down on you and even call you stupid. This is the most unprofessional place in the world. The majority of employees either are drug addicts or alcoholics. They lower your salary without warning. They don’t pay you on bonuses you have to submit them several times in order to get paid on them. DO NOT WORK HERE.

1852,"July 18, 2019",4,I like it. Just hard to balance kids and work I really enjoy the work....it is hard at first but once you catch on its easy. I like that you get a break every 2 hours. They really care about you catching on. Co workers are really nice. The over time pay is nice. However balancing a night shift job which starts at 715 but you need to make sure you are ON TIME so you need to leave around 530 which leaves no time for your family except on Sunday because youll sleep mostly all day on Saturday. I do like it...itll just be better for a single person with no kids or single person with older kidssleep.

1856,"July 15, 2019",1,Awful Lack of understanding and compaction for its workers as humans. Long hours with weekends. Management and communications are as low as they can get.

I was able to learn many different work stations,the process is always different, it also gives you a chance to learn and even communicate with coworkers next to you. Toyota is BIG on being clean,no contamination, no bad Engines, always wanting you to inspect your parts making sure there the correct parts for your process! Management is always positive,Team Leader, Group Leader are usually on line with you keeping a close eye on each and every process and always will to step in and help.

Its  current Manager is one of the biggest gossips in the building. He discusses the President's personal business and past indescressions, along with his staff's personal discussions with him. He cannot seem to take ownership of his actions without throwing staff members under the bus to justify his unwarranted decisions. He doesn't have the experience to manage people without making it personal. He wants to be your friend in and outside of the office but is so childish, that if you're unresponsive to his personal needs, he becomes angry and unstable. He treats his employees like they are expendable and makes sure that they know it. He always has to have one employee, that he puts on an undeserved pedestal. It seems that he chooses them by how much they are willing to sell their co-workers down the river. Who ever tattles the most is the winner. Unfortunately, this usually goes to their head and they embellish the truth in order to expedite the removal of whomever they dislike at the moment. He implements rules and policies that apply to everyone but his current favorite. This includes the transfer of accounts, punctuality, time off, and even incentives.

Continuous work improvement, cleanliness is a plus. I learned a lot from working at Toyota, having patience, solving problems. I was able to learn many different work stations,the process is always different, it also gives you a chance to learn and even communicate with coworkers next to you. Toyota is BIG on being clean,no contamination, no bad Engines, always wanting you to inspect your parts making sure there the correct parts for your process! Management is always positive,Team Leader, Group Leader are usually on line with you keeping a close eye on each and every process and always will to step in and help. The open door policy is good, you can always express your opinion and receive good feedback.. I can say that I had a great time working for Toyota Motor Manufacturing,we all make mistakes but remember to never give up!!!"

2145,"April 21, 2019",1,"A history of gossip, drama, and shameful behavior The Business Development Center seems to be the hub and origin of gossip and strange behavior. Its  current Manager is one of the biggest gossips in the building. He discusses the President's personal business and past indescressions, along with his staff's personal discussions with him. He cannot seem to take ownership of his actions without throwing staff members under the bus to justify his unwarranted decisions. He doesn't have the experience to manage people without making it personal. He wants to be your friend in and outside of the office but is so childish, that if you're unresponsive to his personal needs, he becomes angry and unstable. He treats his employees like they are expendable and makes sure that they know it. He always has to have one employee, that he puts on an undeserved pedestal. It seems that he chooses them by how much they are willing to sell their co-workers down the river. Who ever tattles the most is the winner. Unfortunately, this usually goes to their head and they embellish the truth in order to expedite the removal of whomever they dislike at the moment. He implements rules and policies that apply to everyone but his current favorite. This includes the transfer of accounts, punctuality, time off, and even incentives. Not exactly my favorite place to work at the moment."

Had a rotating schedule so was never able to plan anything outside of work. After working till midnight all week you had to come in and work early in the morning on weekends. Work always was distributed to the favorites in the shop and you were left with oil changes that paid .3 with mandatory unpaid inspections and car washes. Service manager was one of the rudest people I had ever met, and his wife is the Human Resources supervisor so there was nobody you could talk to. You had to work 1 of 3 holidays which was a 12 hour shift with no break. Toxic place that I never want to see again"

2228,"April 1, 2019",2,Toyota Loved what I was doing and the people that I worked next to.  The management is made up of family.  They seem to stay together even if one is wrong.  Makes it hard to talk with someone when you have a problem
2229,"March 31, 2019",5,"good  place I loved working there. workday was fast paced I was never without anything to do. forklift training was a new experience the trainer was very informative"
2230,"March 30, 2019",5,"productive, beneficial, Consisted of phone calls all day, going back and forth with my manager to give him numbers and deals that the customers wanted. Friendly environment, lots of netoworking, very upbeat and always something new ans exciting to do."
2231,"March 29, 2019",4,"Exciting work experience Working at Toyota has been an amazing experience. The Work place is fun, exciting and professional. I have grown much  as an employee from the 1 year I have been there"
2232,"March 29, 2019",5,"good place nice place to work very funmorning meetingdo walk around to see new cars that came inmake phone callsthe hardest part of the job is staying motivated"
2233,"March 29, 2019",5,"Fast paced environment! Overall Toyota is a good place to work, it is competitive and demanding. However, the pay is fairly decent and the team members are overall good. (It depends on what you are looking for)."
2234,"March 29, 2019",1,"Poor company mangers Manager lie, poor pay, expensive healthcare, would not pay time and a half for OT witch is illegal in NH. I would not recommend working working for this company to anyone."
2235,"March 29, 2019",4,fun workplace Was a great place to work. my coworkers were great. always good energy going in to work with them. managers were always very helpful. The pay was great and area was perfect
2236,"March 29, 2019",5,Working at Toyota I found working there challenging and stable. One is paid commensurate with performance and the company gives ample assistance to people just starting to acquire the skills needed to do their jobs.
2237,"March 28, 2019",5,"Payroll Processed payroll for 2 locations only in the state of TN. Generally, you have 2-3 payrolls you per location each week. I was able to expand my knowledge in benefits at this location."
2238,"March 28, 2019",5,Intern I really cant give a good review on this place because I wasn't ful time only worked 3 days a week. but I enjoyed it while I was there for my schooling
2239,"March 27, 2019",5,Laid back I worked there as utility worker cleaning the building basically. All the responsibilities fell upon me but I loved it. I worked at my own pace. If I could go back I would definitely do so.
2240,"March 27, 2019",1,Don't end up in bodyweld maintenance The pay is good and the benefits are some of the best but we have allot of people taking pay cuts just to leave because of the poor management and working long hours and weeks without a day off in our area. As long as you don't end up in bodyweld it is a good job.
2241,"March 25, 2019",1,"Stay away from Toyota of Tampa bay One of the worst places I have ever worked. Forced to work till midnight or “find another job”.  Forced weekends. Had a rotating schedule so was never able to plan anything outside of work. After working till midnight all week you had to come in and work early in the morning on weekends. Work always was distributed to the favorites in the shop and you were left with oil changes that paid .3 with mandatory unpaid inspections and car washes. Service manager was one of the rudest people I had ever met, and his wife is the Human Resources supervisor so there was nobody you could talk to. You had to work 1 of 3 holidays which was a 12 hour shift with no break. Toxic place that I never want to see again"
2242,"March 24, 2019",5,"Excellent Loved working fro Toyota just had to relocate otherwise I would still be there all benefits paid, if they made sure your training was up to code and they paid for it"
2243,"March 24, 2019",3,Good Pay Poor Upper Management The pay is very good with no experience required.  Upper management does not understand what it is like to work on the line.  Decisions are made not in favor of employees.
2244,"March 23, 2019",5,"Great place to move up the ladder. Training is excellent when first coming onto your shift. Co-workers strive to help you train, or “level up” in toyota terms. Management was really nice and helpful with getting you where you feel most successful."
2245,"March 22, 2019",4,What i Learned I learned more about myself than i did anything Toyota teaches you just what you might need to know to help in life. Example being a teamleader you learn how to deal with different people of different ways.
2246,"March 22, 2019",5,"Family oriented A fast paced company , I learned a lot about the car business , management is great , everyone is friendly and easy to work with , family oriented , the hardest part was to meet end of month deadlines , the most enjoyable is actually looking forward to going to work everyday ."
2247,"November 17, 2020",5,Awesome workplace  I enjoy my job at Toyota. It is a great opportunity to work with great people and meet new clients.  You are free to work hard and get your job done I would recommend. 
2248,"March 21, 2019",1,"Unpleasant Work Environment The overall energy within the call center is extremely negative. People who are not qualified are put in leadership positions because the right person likes them. People are quitting left and right which should speak volumes as how it is to work in this department. If you want to come to work, do your job and expect to be rewarded based on your productivity, then this is not the place to work. Management doesn’t seem to want to improve things. Instead of positive change they hand out free slices of pizza and cake. I’d rather they spend that money on hiring more qualified people who actually want to come to work. I’ve been told departments outside of the call center are much different but who knows. I’m in my fourth year of employment with this company and sad to say I’m looking for a job outside of Toyota. Things were so much better before the move from California to Texas. I have a feeling things will get much worse before they get better and I have no intentions on being around at that point."

2252,"March 20, 2019",5,Nice work environment I don’t work for Toyota I work 3rd party Safety there. Staff is great and safety is really the culture. It has really been a good experience here and I’ve met great people

2254,"March 19, 2019",3,Good people to work with but your hours will get cut. I enjoyed working there until management decided to cut all the express techs hours. You basically had to work almost twice as hard to get what you made before. Management was cool and the people were all friendly.
2255,"March 18, 2019",5,"Toyota is a legit company Your are treated like a commodity at this company.  It is a very stable company, but I do not know if I would say it's such an awesome place for young employees.

2256,"March 17, 2019",4,Stable Employment Toyota is an old school company that has a stable work environment but limited autonomy. Meetings often get in the way of actual work.

The only issue I had is they are growing too fast for the call center. There are not enough people. So they are always offering overtime.

Its not as inclusive and there is a huge disconnect that can affect your ability to successfully do your job. Despite the disparity, Toyota is a huge advocate for its employees and their development in their careers and personal lives. Each department is different."
2418,"February 6, 2019",2,Very basic environment Typical day is spent sitting down from 8:00 am waiting for work while not being paid. first service ticket typically is handed out well into 2.5 hours into your day with very little chance of up sells due to low income area and poorly trained advisors. The hardest part of the job is time spent not working and being required to stay the entire day with 0% compensation for being there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers & the schedule
2419,"February 6, 2019",3,"Not a fun place to work, disrespect you, harrass you, I'm glad i quit because i couldn't take it anymore nor my body. I'm glad I quit Toyota, I used to love working there when I first started but the management has went down hill considerably. HR harasses you constantly for no reason, they have poor decision making skills, they do not care about their team members only the products. The more engines they can push out of the door the better, no matter how much it hurts the team members. I do not recommend this job to anybody with a family or a person that is over 30 years old die to it breaking your body down and there is no work/home life balance."
2420,"February 4, 2019",4,Overall Good Place to Work working at Toyota has been an amazing opportunity. I have learned more about supply chain then I could had ever imagined. Unfortunately I am not passionate about cars or else this would be a dream job for me.

2422,"February 4, 2019",5,"Good company Hours are easy, they care about your time, they have a great insurance plan for you and your family. Low pressure sales job. Great discounts on the cars they sell, making it a great place to work."
2423,"February 4, 2019",3,Fast-Paced Work Environment Great Pay and Benefits. The company has a very active community environment. There are many clubs and organizations you can join. Very competitive pay and benefits for the area.
2424,"February 4, 2019",5,Productive Easy job for first job. Everyone is really nice. The pay was very good. My training class and trainer was nice. Good work environment. Also I learned A lot working there.
2425,"February 3, 2019",4,"sales experince I learned a lot for  customer service , managing the deal and follow up the customer,also convinced customer and do all steps to close the deal. I do  my best for sales, present the car, New and used  and compare all cars and explain the  features . I love sales because I love people and it is very fun to do sales because customer always is my friend and I want to help them to make sure they are going be happy of shopping ."
2426,"February 2, 2019",2,"Its not for everyone There is a huge disconnect between line workers and management. Lots of disgruntled employees. Up to three years as temp and then eight years to top out. They say everyone is treated the same which is very untrue, I have been lied to several times and no one seems to care. They preach family atmosphere but that's the farthest thing from the truth, everyone is a number. The pay is decent if you stick around long enough and the benefits aren't bad but toyota is living off a reputation they made years ago and it's just not that way any longer.

2432,"January 30, 2019",5,Worked on Assembly II My job started everyday with group exercises. Once that was done I would take a tow cart and pick up frames and deliver them to the assembly line. I always kept a hand held radio on me in the case of an emergency.

2436,"November 17, 2020",5,Awesome workplace  I enjoy my job at Toyota. It is a great opportunity to work with great people and meet new clients.  You are free to work hard and get your job done I would recommend. 
2437,"February 6, 2019",3,"good job good job and good company you work and have a commission  shame on you for having job posters have to add something like this and being mandatory is bad"
2438,"February 6, 2019",1,"Contractor Experience is Different than Team Member I worked at Toyota as a Contractor win the Information Systems department, and while it is a great company to work for - the experience for a contractor is much different. Its not as inclusive and there is a huge disconnect that can affect your ability to successfully do your job. Despite the disparity, Toyota is a huge advocate for its employees and their development in their careers and personal lives. Each department is different."
2439,"February 6, 2019",2,Very basic environment Typical day is spent sitting down from 8:00 am waiting for work while not being paid. first service ticket typically is handed out well into 2.5 hours into your day with very little chance of up sells due to low income area and poorly trained advisors. The hardest part of the job is time spent not working and being required to stay the entire day with 0% compensation for being there. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers & the schedule
2440,"February 6, 2019",3,"Not a fun place to work, disrespect you, harrass you, I'm glad i quit because i couldn't take it anymore nor my body. I'm glad I quit Toyota, I used to love working there when I first started but the management has went down hill considerably. HR harasses you constantly for no reason, they have poor decision making skills, they do not care about their team members only the products. The more engines they can push out of the door the better, no matter how much it hurts the team members. I do not recommend this job to anybody with a family or a person that is over 30 years old die to it breaking your body down and there is no work/home life balance."
2441,"February 4, 2019",4,Overall Good Place to Work working at Toyota has been an amazing opportunity. I have learned more about supply chain then I could had ever imagined. Unfortunately I am not passionate about cars or else this would be a dream job for me.
2442,"February 4, 2019",4,"Great Place to Work In general, it's a great place to work. All staff is very friendly, opportunities for advancement is there if you are an actual Toyota employee. Difficult to advance if currently a contractor."
2443,"February 4, 2019",5,"Good company Hours are easy, they care about your time, they have a great insurance plan for you and your family. Low pressure sales job. Great discounts on the cars they sell, making it a great place to work."
2444,"February 4, 2019",3,Fast-Paced Work Environment Great Pay and Benefits. The company has a very active community environment. There are many clubs and organizations you can join. Very competitive pay and benefits for the area.
2445,"February 4, 2019",5,Productive Easy job for first job. Everyone is really nice. The pay was very good. My training class and trainer was nice. Good work environment. Also I learned A lot working there.
2446,"February 3, 2019",4,"sales experince I learned a lot for  customer service , managing the deal and follow up the customer,also convinced customer and do all steps to close the deal. I do  my best for sales, present the car, New and used  and compare all cars and explain the  features . I love sales because I love people and it is very fun to do sales because customer always is my friend and I want to help them to make sure they are going be happy of shopping ."
2447,"February 2, 2019",2,"Its not for everyone There is a huge disconnect between line workers and management. Lots of disgruntled employees. Up to three years as temp and then eight years to top out. They say everyone is treated the same which is very untrue, I have been lied to several times and no one seems to care. They preach family atmosphere but that's the farthest thing from the truth, everyone is a number. The pay is decent if you stick around long enough and the benefits aren't bad but toyota is living off a reputation they made years ago and it's just not that way any longer. Talk to someone who works there before you make a decision."
2448,"January 31, 2019",5,"good environment I would recommend anyone to work for Toyota. They are a good work group, and the people are very helpful. If I had the chance to go back there I would. I love the people who work there."

When there where concerts i would help set up all the lights and curtains. I helped put down the ice for hockey season. After every event we would clean out the bleachers and also clean the rest of the building before we where able to go home.

I've learned to be stern  when minimizing wasted time and  developing work where the mind couldn't imagine it to go. I'm constantly terminating jobs  and finding time to work another employee to the max.  I feel my managers job is to pass down  work that only auditors look at.

2527,"January 13, 2019",4,Toyota is a nice factory Job. The best Factory to work in Kentucky. At the end of the day is a factory job. you will get bored and you will work hard at times but you get paid well
2528,"January 13, 2019",3,good dealership great products Good dealership decent pay. Excellent product and product training and development.  Mangement is merely sales people moved up with tenure not necessarily good mangers.
2529,"January 13, 2019",1,Toyota of North Charlotte STAY AWAY AND LOOK FOR A NEW WORK PLACE. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO. There is no advancement and you will not get treated like you should. And the pay is not good either

2531,"January 10, 2019",3,Fun work place majority of time. Great to be self driven and set your own goals for sales.  Team work environment.  I felt that the company set sales goals that were obtainable and was driven to reach these goals.  Driving and understanding the new cars such as the hybrids was great to learn.
2532,"January 10, 2019",4,Fast paced Good pay long hours. Last minute changes. Sometimes you wonder why things are done the way they do them seems to make no sense. It seems that we are trained one way and management goes against that training.

Management made you set your monthly quotas  at the first of the month. We met as a sales group every Friday morning to discuss how many units we had for the week. This would always get loud and ugly against the sales people who were behind or not working very hard. I almost always had good numbers but I had to set in the meeting and listen to our boss belittle people in front of all sales people instead of doing some one on one with the slower sales people. I discussed this with him several times because it really had a negative effect on morale but he did not care and told me to not let it bother me, but that  is the way he has always run his sales team.

I also didn't agree with a lot of policies. My main issue was the fact that they were not understanding in a lot of ways.

I wanted to just come in, keep my head down, do as good of a job as possible, and leave but your not ever going to receive a promotion if thats what you do.

My day off was supposed to be Friday, but they always had a mail sale on Friday so I couldn't have the day off. You work at least 90 hrs a week. I would make a game of it though so it wouldn't seem that long. I made up a way of confronting customers without them thinking I was going to be a pushy sales person. I would tell them ""hello"" my name is -----. I am here to protect you from all the other sales people you see hovering over there looking at us. I promise I won't try to sell you a car or say anything to you.  I will just follow you around so the other sales people don't come over hounding you because they will if I leave. I'd tell them if they had any questions to please feel free to ask me, but I'm not going to sell them a car today. 9 times out of 10 they would start asking me questions about the car and I'd end up selling them the car."

I learned alot about cars, first day I walked in the door I knew nothing about cars but thanks to there techs that train you on the job it made it really easy and quick to learn. The techs and lube techs often cut up with each other and have alot of fun but the service advisors are a little different story. The hardest part of the job is the service advisors, they can be rude and difficult to deal with alot of times. The most enjoyable part is just chatting with the guys about anything and everything as you work witch makes the time fly by"

Most of the managers were great, but a couple made for an almost hostile work environment that lead to me leaving a specific department."

2731,"November 7, 2018",4,"Career advancing plant Great place to work with very good pay. Fast pace work, available for all ages. I worked with people just starting at the age of 55. It can be strenuous at times."
2732,"November 7, 2018",5,"Good place Nice friendly place, and the people do all work together. it's nice because the all get along, something that some places don't give you. Nice flexibility with hours. You can work as much as you want or as little as you want.  They do a good job with working mothers and it's nice when the owner of Team Toyota come around and says hello to everyone during the week."

2734,"November 6, 2018",4,"It was fun place to work, as long as you have good sales I enjoyed working there, we learned a lot about Toyota products, had a lot of fun, sold a lot of vehicles. Management made you set your monthly quotas  at the first of the month. We met as a sales group every Friday morning to discuss how many units we had for the week. This would always get loud and ugly against the sales people who were behind or not working very hard. I almost always had good numbers but I had to set in the meeting and listen to our boss belittle people in front of all sales people instead of doing some one on one with the slower sales people. I discussed this with him several times because it really had a negative effect on morale but he did not care and told me to not let it bother me, but that  is the way he has always run his sales team. I really enjoyed selling vehicles, it was fun and I learned a lot."
2735,"November 6, 2018",3,"Good job overall, but stressful and unfair at times Toyota is an overall good place to work, but can be very stressful. I spent more time at work than I did with my family which caused me a lot of issues. I  didn't feel like we were done fairly as far as our medical coverage. I also didn't agree with a lot of policies. My main issue was the fact that they were not understanding in a lot of ways. I wont go into too much detail, but I will say that the pay was great, but there is a lot of room from improvement there. It starts with management."
2736,"November 5, 2018",1,"Do not consider toyota of elizabeth city Very unethical, you will regret it!!! Constant management changes, questionable practices, terrible schedules, no management support. Consider any other store in the us before applying at toyota of elizabeth city"
2737,"November 4, 2018",4,"Decent pay, good benefits but favoritism is everywhere I did not mind the job, its monotonous but its an assembly line soooo....The main problem I had was it didn't matter how hard you worked or how good your quality was it mattered who's butt you kissed or who you knew. If your a woman, the prettier you are the better off your going to be. I wanted to just come in, keep my head down, do as good of a job as possible, and leave but your not ever going to receive a promotion if thats what you do. I put in for a promotion several times but was told I really needed to stop my group leader and A.M. more often and say overly nice things them in order to get the promotion. Id like to point out that I was always respectful towards them and said hello whenever they would speak to me"
2738,"November 4, 2018",2,Just don't They take away any bonuses if you don't top everyone else. Force you to act like a trained circus monkey. The work life balance does not exist. Just don't do it.
2739,"November 2, 2018",2,down fall of the job When it is almost time to leave you are told that you are working over. You don't have the choice of not working weekends. You will be working 7 days a week. This place is not a good place to work if your mental is not stable.
2740,"November 2, 2018",3,"Decent Company The company wasn't too bad to work for.  I would recommend the company to anyone.  I worked part time in the evenings and the work environment for me was sometimes, busy and sometimes slow depending on the day."
2741,"November 1, 2018",4,"Good customer service skills required Work was normally what they call ""bell' to ""bell"". You'd work from open to close everyday of the week. My day off was supposed to be Friday, but they always had a mail sale on Friday so I couldn't have the day off. You work at least 90 hrs a week. I would make a game of it though so it wouldn't seem that long. I made up a way of confronting customers without them thinking I was going to be a pushy sales person. I would tell them ""hello"" my name is -----. I am here to protect you from all the other sales people you see hovering over there looking at us. I promise I won't try to sell you a car or say anything to you.  I will just follow you around so the other sales people don't come over hounding you because they will if I leave. I'd tell them if they had any questions to please feel free to ask me, but I'm not going to sell them a car today. 9 times out of 10 they would start asking me questions about the car and I'd end up selling them the car."
2742,"October 31, 2018",1,"Just keep looking No work/life balance. Dealership makes all the money. They are over priced compared to the other Toyota lots in town. Fellow employees are nice, but management is clueless. Go to another dealership if you want to sell cars."
2743,"October 30, 2018",1,"Terrible place to work, you are just a number on a board If you want to be treated like a number on a board toyota is the place for you. Poor management and decision making. They preach quality and safety but when you bring up quality and safety issues your are completely ignored. Toyota  is only interested in making as much money as possible with no concern for damages made in the process."

2745,"October 29, 2018",3,"Could be better Do not stand up to their word, it’s always a problem if you mention your pay, no online training for new employees and due to the location of my home pay could be better."
2746,"October 29, 2018",3,"The job is ok but the people make it hard A typical day at Toyota is alot of oil changes and tire rotates and some cleaning. I learned alot about cars, first day I walked in the door I knew nothing about cars but thanks to there techs that train you on the job it made it really easy and quick to learn. The techs and lube techs often cut up with each other and have alot of fun but the service advisors are a little different story. The hardest part of the job is the service advisors, they can be rude and difficult to deal with alot of times. The most enjoyable part is just chatting with the guys about anything and everything as you work witch makes the time fly by"

2829,"October 5, 2018",5,Working at Toyota is a fast pace and stressful situation because getting to the customers on time is of critical importance to your job performance You are expected to perform your job as specified and perform whatever is asked of you and you are monitored as to your performance my manager is a gentleman and he listens to your gripes and if there is anything he can do positively for you he will work with you as long it’s not against company policies
2830,"October 5, 2018",1,"Pay plan sucks Toyota of Berkeley is a joke whatever you do, do not work there. You’re better off working at Starbucks as you will not make money when you’re getting paid $50 dollars per car sold. Management also play favoritism as they will only send leads to the people who have been there the longest. On top of the bad pay you have to be moving your car every 2 hours because Toyota of Berkeley has no employee parking. Also, because of the location the dealer has no space so you are going to be walking to and from storage facilities on a daily to get cars to show the customers."
2831,"October 4, 2018",5,"You will work a lot but it will feel like a family I would love to still work here, but it was not feasible for me to work hereand have a family. This was based solely on the hours I had to spend. THe training, management, and culture were top notch."

I was totally unprepared to work with such a terrible group of people. The people who work hard and do the right thing are not rewarded for their efforts. People constantly game the system and everyone knows it, but they are not addressed. The work is very physical and it breaks you down. People there stab others in the back. I don't understand people like that. The monthly meetings tell you that Toyota is doing great, ""Best month ever in sales!"" but when it comes time for a raise, ""Oh, well we have had some major setbacks, etc, etc"" They just want a lemming, they do not want people with ""a fresh set of eyes"" to solve problems."

3513,"March 22, 2018",1,"Tough on your family life, poor management, work life balance is balanced toward work due to rotating shifts. Stay away! Been at TMMMS since it started. The shift rotation is very hard on your health, your family, and your friends. You will lose most of your friends because they will become tired of asking you to visit and you saying I can't because I have to work or I worked last night so I need to sleep. Your family will receive the worst because you will take out your irritability on them because of only getting 4 or 5 hrs of sleep that day and your son only wants to play catch. I have never worked at a place where you constantly see people out with major health issues, mostly heart problems or cancer. There was a man who died from a heart attack on the floor of the plant. Terrible! The rotating shift is not working, extremely high turn over rate and unable to attract truly skilled workers in production and maintenance. They won't admit it's not working and are to proud to admit they are wrong in changing it to a fixed shift. They do pay well and have good benefits, but you will be like me, trapped in the money and giving up a happy existence for money. I wish I never put in an application for Toyota. I wish they never hired me. I was happier making 35000 A year than I am now. Do yourself a favor and find a job that is day shift, 5 days a week and be happy. Avoid Toyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi!!! Avoid it !!! Also, everyone hears about the Toyota Way across the world, it is total BS.

4295,"October 2, 2017",3,Not a good place to work I would say the only bad part about where i work at is they make too many promises but don't follow through. They give people hope saying they will move them to a team but never do.

Overall management was great. Workplace culture , it is a competition, fun work environment. great group various races came together to make money.  Landing the customer that does not have the means to buy on a Vehicle. Most enjoyable part of the job i would add was talking to new people everyday.  and having Toyota events for example new inventory info and sales lunch meets."
4300,"September 29, 2017",3,"laid off After working there for 2 months and being acknowledged as a hard working employee I was called into the office and was part of the 24 people lay off. I think its extremely unfair to waste my time like this, the unfortunate part is my supervisor fought to keep me from being laid off and was unsuccessful. I really did enjoy my job and am extremely disheartened by this."
4301,"September 29, 2017",2,"Lack of Good Leadership There seems to be a lot of political maneuvering among executives and managers creating a tense environment. Managers don't seem to really know what they are doing and some are inexperienced. A lot of employees have worked there so long that they don't really do much for the company anymore. A plus is that people are allowed to work from home a lot maybe because there is a lot of jockeying for work or being bored. If your only skill is speaking Japanese and English you will be hired and promoted fairly quickly."

Decided to work 1 more year at the initial pay rate and was denied again. So that's when I began to look for a new job that would offer a higher compensation.

Japanese culture is going through a sea change where even the government is asking companies to promote fewer working hours so that marriage and having children can take some focus. Unfortunately, the Japanese management in the US didn't get that memo and think everyone should work Japanese hours - 12 to 15 a day. That takes a toll on your family and lessens the quality of life.

The culture was extremely diverse , almost every station had different cultures, and hardest part of job is making sure you pay attention to timing cause if you didn't run your machine right, it would go down and the out side team wouldn't have enough parts for the other station. Most enjoyable part id say was probably how good as a team we worked together. seemed like a sport , very competition like with other stations."

I handled providing information about recalls potentially effecting customers' vehicles. I have learned a lot about recalls and customer service in general at the job. The management was excellent; they would provide follow ups with the reps weekly and give an overall assessment for the month. At work we would generally clock in and receive inbound calls. Hardest part of the job was when a new recall hit and we would have to gather the info provided on it and deal with the customers swiftly (Which got easier with time). The most enjoyable part... Eh for a time I had my own cubicle: that was cool.

My experience has been positive overall. Toyota does a great job of preventing HR issues from arising within management, which can be a huge source of stress at other employers. Company culture is good with room for improvement. Toyota is very conservative with project investment. There's not much interest in R&D or anything that doesn't have an immediate and well-understood ROI. That can be frustrating for those who want to try something more cutting-edge. That said, for those who love incremental change, Toyota's kaizen methods are for you. I've had multiple opportunities to affect change in both a production and pre-production environment.

4902,"May 30, 2017",1,"Not a pleasant job. Very little money. They hire more people than they need, and after a month or so, it's strict commission. So, it's a small investment for them to hire people.  They have older auto sales people who have been there who they favor - I don't have a problem with that, actually. They've earned it to some degree. But it goes too far. Because of this, you get very few leads and simply can't make a living. Management was of little help. Pretty useless. Led by a grumpy guy.

Goals are mostly unattainable and managers are very ""my way or the highway"", but then also tell you to work as a team. It being sales, you will run into people stealing sales and not caring.

They made every opportunity available for you to learn your job and why things were done a certain way, the history of the company, and what the future may look like.

I learned that Toyota was a company that cared about its employees, their community, causes, the Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, teens, the elderly, etc. Toyota also stressed respect for each other, including outside vendors. Respecting others helped me to gain quite a few friends and maintain relationships. This lead to great collaborating sessions."

5204,"March 8, 2017",1,"Toyota Indiana I have worked at Toyota Indiana for a year now. When I first started, I thought I could make this job into a career. I quickly realized that I was wrong. The job pays very well, but is an awful place to work. Everyone is always out to get one another, and no one works as a team. The management is AWFUl. They encourage you to get other people in trouble, and if they don't like you they can/will make up stories to get you fired. The job wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the people. I worked at McDonalds in College, and that was hands down better than working for Toyota. I am tired of working for a company that doesn't care about its employees. At the end of the day, it all about who came out ahead. You cannot trust anyone. I have never missed a day. and I try to keep to myself as much as possible. I had 2 different incidents where I was being harassed, and when reported they told me it was in my head. I was being called names, cursed at, made fun of, and discriminated against. HR doesn't work to protect you or your rights, they work to protect the company and they could care less about you."

Again, I've learned a lot. I love interacting with the international personalities at Toyota, the management is excellent. They do have some very slow and antiquated computer systems that take away from productivity. Love the people that I work with, but sadly, each week, some of them move to Texas permanently."
5218,"March 10, 2017",4,"Great People to work for Great place to work depending on the department and your specific manager and co-workers. The job was mostly fun and fast paced. There was a lack of leadership when it was needed most. Benefits were expensive but available. The General Manager is really helpful in stepping in and following with issues when all else fails. Great guy."
5219,"March 10, 2017",5,Production Assembly Line Walking is a main part of this job. Providing parts for the team in a timely manor. Never stop the team from working. Keeping focus on the main goals.
5220,"March 9, 2017",4,"work easy day by day job 12 hours shifts skilled maintenance technician, everyone is friendly , work all week and have weekends off, Toyota has their own culture that everyone follows"
5221,"March 9, 2017",4,"fun fast past my experience is to date a fun, exciting, fast pace place to work. The management is very family oriented and friendly. The staff is very diverse and fun to work with."
5222,"March 9, 2017",4,great benefits On a typical day there I would build the V-6 engine. The management on my line wasn't that great at the time. I met some really great people there. The pay and benefits are great and if I could I would go back in a heartbeat.
5223,"March 9, 2017",3,Fun Place A fun place to work but not much room for advance. A great place to get trained in the industry with some of the best talent overall around. They do keep managers.
5224,"March 8, 2017",1,do NOT work here Don't be fooled by the commercials. They do not care about their customers or their employees. The owner and the CFO are awful human beings and it will all come out eventually. They are terrible to work under. Do not work here
5225,"March 8, 2017",1,"Toyota Indiana I have worked at Toyota Indiana for a year now. When I first started, I thought I could make this job into a career. I quickly realized that I was wrong. The job pays very well, but is an awful place to work. Everyone is always out to get one another, and no one works as a team. The management is AWFUl. They encourage you to get other people in trouble, and if they don't like you they can/will make up stories to get you fired. The job wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the people. I worked at McDonalds in College, and that was hands down better than working for Toyota. I am tired of working for a company that doesn't care about its employees. At the end of the day, it all about who came out ahead. You cannot trust anyone. I have never missed a day. and I try to keep to myself as much as possible. I had 2 different incidents where I was being harassed, and when reported they told me it was in my head. I was being called names, cursed at, made fun of, and discriminated against. HR doesn't work to protect you or your rights, they work to protect the company and they could care less about you."
5226,"March 7, 2017",2,Unfriendly staff I felt that this company was too clique within the office staff. If one female did not take a liking to you then you were sure to know it. Innuendos and comments were unnecessary. You could feel the tension in the air.
5227,"March 6, 2017",4,"Great place for a short term contract While completing an extended six month contract here, I came to greatly enjoy the well supported, friendly and team-focused environment of Toyota.  It is a company that believes in its employees and it shows."

My friend and I started at the same time, and he was promptly let go after missing a day of work due to a car accident he was involved in. The pay is miserable, as Toyota starts off everyone at 9.50 an hour. The work is mind numbing and repetitive. You WILL be performing the same tasks  repeatedly for 12 plus hours a day, with 2 15 min breaks and 1 30 min lunch break. Attendance is taken immediately following lunch, to make sure everyone arrives on time, meaning you have to be at your work muster station LITERALLY within 30 seconds of your lunch/break ending, or you will be reprimanded. Everyone is miserable there, and I have witnessed more than a few temp employees breakdown crying due to the harsh treatment by some of the full time Toyota supervisors  Additionally, Toyota has the WORST restrooms I have ever seen. They were constantly out of order, and the few that were working properly were filthy. The soap is never refilled, lighting that works when it wants to, EXTREMELY inadequate ventilation for the amount of people who were expected to use the facilities.

5310,"February 7, 2017",4,Long ours Can have long hours depending on project and group.  Little in the way of formal training as most is on the job.  Staffing level doesn't allow for proper mentorship because of work load.

5314,"February 6, 2017",4,"Big Company, many jobs to choose from. Most jobs are repetitive work and standing or walking all shift.  Overall a good company to work for. The pay is good and you can get 2 bonuses a year. The best thing about the company they have never had a lay-off."
5315,"February 6, 2017",1,"I do not recommend this place for employment First off, let me start by saying I was at this dealership for a decent while. At least long enough to get to know every employee, know the job well, and perform accordingly. First, I shall warn you on advancement opportunities. They love to say there are a ton of opportunites for advancement when you first start. That is false. This place is a dead end job. As a sales person, you can make good money if you're good at selling cars and can definitely live off of that. I will not specify my past position due to wanting to stay anonymous, but this dealership and the managers do not care whatsoever about their employees. All they care about is MONEY. If you don't make this company $25K+ a month, they cut you. Their expectations are always WAY too high to reach. Secondly, let's speak raises. Haha maybe it's better if we don't. Asking for a raise in this place is seriously a joke to them. They have never been willing to pay their employees what they deserve, even if they are hard working employees. They look at everyone as they are replaceable. Thats why there is such a high turn over rate in employees at this dealership. If you're looking to make a career out of something here, I honestly don't recommend this place. If you're looking for a job where they will never reward you for your hard efforts and barely even recognize you as an employee, you've found the right place.

5404,"January 10, 2017",1,"Poor Commissions and Poor Training This dealership is under new ownership yet it still suffers from a poor reputation with the public because I’m told the previous owner treated many customers very badly and people remember that and avoid coming back. Consequently, there are not as many customers coming in the door as there should be. Commissions are all just mini’s and real bonuses don’t start until you sell 12 cars/ mo  which many salespeople fail to reach. The majority of new car sales are made exclusively by just two teams, the Brazilian team and the Toyota employees team, but you can’t touch their customers.  The other salespeople are left to try and make their quota selling the comparatively few walk ins that come in. Incredibly, they keep hiring more salespeople yet I think they need LESS so the current ones have a better chance at selling 12 cars per month. I was told they are running a 200 % turnover rate among salespeople and I believe it. Training was poor because the instructor spent most of his time selling cars for himself instead of teaching us. Management leads by intimidation and feels if you don’t have enough customers it’s YOUR fault and YOU are to blame. They don’t even have enough desks for everyone and you have to share one with three other salesmen making it hard to do business at times.

Consequently, there are not as many customers coming in the door as there should be. Commissions are all just mini’s and real bonuses don’t start until you sell 12 cars/ mo  which many salespeople fail to reach. The majority of new car sales are made exclusively by just two teams, the Brazilian team and the Toyota employees team, but you can’t touch their customers.  The other salespeople are left to try and make their quota selling the comparatively few walk ins that come in. Incredibly, they keep hiring more salespeople yet I think they need LESS so the current ones have a better chance at selling 12 cars per month. I was told they are running a 200 % turnover rate among salespeople and I believe it. Training was poor because the instructor spent most of his time selling cars for himself instead of teaching us. Management leads by intimidation and feels if you don’t have enough customers it’s YOUR fault and YOU are to blame. They don’t even have enough desks for everyone and you have to share one with three other salesmen making it hard to do business at times. So be forewarned: if you think you can sell enough cars to make a living by only relying on just the walk ins know that others have already tried this and failed."

I worked on the used car lot and had a great manager who wanted to see me succeed. The management was like family and always made us want to perform higher than we were. It was a great expierence to get a step in the door for sales. I would recommend anyone who wants to make a lot of money and learn from some great car salesman to apply at Toyota. I don't know if I could have chosen a better place to start my sales expierence. I would even go back to them if I ever need a job or run into hard times.
5504,"December 13, 2016",4,"my  Work place My day begins by coming in earlier than the other workers to do the inventory set up stands. Load cash registers and assigning post, Have to keep track of all sales me sure people is not stealing. Dealing with Customers and large crowds. I learned how to deal with a large crowd interacting with people of a different culture. We will work as a team my co workers will know how to handle people and make sure they are taking care of.The hardest part of the job is dealing with an angry customer and having a large crowd and not enough workers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the free access to music tours meeting celebrities as well as meeting the Houston Rockets players when they play."

The same goes with co-workers, bonding with them by building trust and confidence in our department. To keep everything organized and have the right inventory for our store while just being there to assist anyone who needed help, that's what I enjoyed most. Being open 7 days a week 11 hours a day with a 3 manned crew, the most challenging was getting away from the phones long enough to manage and review reports, clean, reorganized and restructure for new incoming inventory and out with the old.

The management takes time to listen to my concerns and address them professionally and in a timely manner.  I see myself working for this company for a long time. There are opportunities for advancement and growth within the company that are available to me and are within my reach. The co-workers really make work enjoyable. It is important to me that I not only like the position I am employed to do but also the people I work for.  The only thing I wish for the company to improve on would be the benefits offered. Unfortunately, the benefits offered do not benefit me to my liking."

All the associates (which was as the Regional employees, included myself were associates) were extremely nice, fun, as well as caring people.  Yes they do have a ping pong table and some other gaming machines/tables in the back; however they all still maintained a professional and respectful workplace. All of the benefits Toyota has to offer all of their employees- health insurance, 401k, life insurance in addition to all their other retire plans- are unparalleled.  Toyota also has a generous amount of 'Work Perks' from employee vehicle lease and purchase programs, college tuition for affiliated schools, to lift tickets, concerts, shows, and volunteer opportunities galore (especially Habitat for Humanity). Overall Toyota is an amazing automotive company doing great things for their customers and the environment as well as the countries they do business in."

Through that day we would set hourly goals to make sure we were on target for the day.  This was a production company so hitting our target was very important.  The hardest part about the job was the extra overtime that was issued when production was consistently not met.

My supervisor was the most inefficient manager I ever had, just trying to look good all the time. The respect for people is a lie, nobody practices that. Managers are constantly rude, condecending to specialists and shop team members, HR will believe whatever your manager says, true or not. HR is even worse as they are only there to make sure some people follow company policy and gossip, that is all HR does. Over the course of 16 months I worked there, I knew 12 people that quit the Lexus project and myself...Lexus is doomed to fail unless they take out the bad managers. Japanese should take over and let americans do only manual and skilled jobs. Everything is disorganized, people are held in jobs against their will, as they don't even let you change depts. Mysoginism and racism, are a winning quality of Toyota managers, if you're smart, don't be a big spender and try to live the Toyota lifestyle, where you take more than you can afford and survive on overtime. Almost 90% of the people in Lexus are miserable, but they can't leave their jobs...don't be like them, be financially conscientous and get out while you can"

6299,"October 5, 2015",5,Work Life Balance Toyota was an excellent company to work for. A typical day of work was to manage my daily activities and also problem solve if a problem was established with shipping. I became more professional when working at Toyota. I learned how to manage my time and be a self starter and able to make decisions on my own. The most challenging part of the job was trying to get a managers input was difficult due to they were always in meetings. The most enjoyable part of working at Toyota were most if not all the people were welcoming and willing to help you with any questions' that had arisen.

I learned something new everyday as everyone does in life. Management would step in when needed otherwise they let us do our job, My co workers did their jobs and ask for help when needed and would answer any questions if I ask. I would say the hardest part of my job would be dealing with the completion dates. The most enjoyable part would be a making a customer happy."

6304,"October 20, 2015",4,"Managent sucks, and HR also No amount of money is worth the stuff that I went through at Toyota. My supervisor was the most inefficient manager I ever had, just trying to look good all the time. The respect for people is a lie, nobody practices that. Managers are constantly rude, condecending to specialists and shop team members, HR will believe whatever your manager says, true or not. HR is even worse as they are only there to make sure some people follow company policy and gossip, that is all HR does. Over the course of 16 months I worked there, I knew 12 people that quit the Lexus project and myself...Lexus is doomed to fail unless they take out the bad managers. Japanese should take over and let americans do only manual and skilled jobs. Everything is disorganized, people are held in jobs against their will, as they don't even let you change depts. Mysoginism and racism, are a winning quality of Toyota managers, if you're smart, don't be a big spender and try to live the Toyota lifestyle, where you take more than you can afford and survive on overtime. Almost 90% of the people in Lexus are miserable, but they can't leave their jobs...don't be like them, be financially conscientous and get out while you can"

I learned how to build intakes and piston heads.

A review is conducted with the SME's in my team to ensure the root cause is identified and a fix is either implemented or will be implemented in the immediate future.  Then I immerse myself into projects, planning and implementations. At TFS I have learned that there is no one individual to blame for any events that adversely affect the business.  There is however a sense of Kaizen, continuous improvement.  Improvement in processes, training, and systems.  This is engrained in the management and their employees from beginning.  Collaboration is key.  There is a sense of teamwork without competition. Management at TFS can be perceived as being slow to react but they seem to make decisions for the long run and not a knee jerk reaction to short term issues.  This can be the hardest part of the job as well.  One needs patience.  Even when one is perceived as being not fit for a position, TFS takes the time to invest in their people. The most enjoyable part of the job is not the work itself the what other opportunities the TFS offers.

Before I was a lube technician I was a service valet that required driving and cleaning customer vehicles. As a lube technician I changed oil and rotated tires most commonly for the work orders. I learned how to work well and get along with a decent sized team. Not everyone is always pleasant to work with, but not allowing that to effect your own work was a learning experience. The management was nice and mostly considerate. There demands were always reasonable, nothing outrageous or strange. My team members were the best part of the job, but other co-workers from the different sub departments were sometimes challenging to work with. I believe that was due to a difference in priorities and motivation. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable both fall on the team members. At times it would feel like a group of guys hanging out, joking around. At other times it felt like a competition where everyone is only looking out for themselves."

Before I was a lube technician I was a service valet that required driving and cleaning customer vehicles. As a lube technician I changed oil and rotated tires most commonly for the work orders. I learned how to work well and get along with a decent sized team. Not everyone is always pleasant to work with, but not allowing that to effect your own work was a learning experience. The management was nice and mostly considerate. There demands were always reasonable, nothing outrageous or strange. My team members were the best part of the job, but other co-workers from the different sub departments were sometimes challenging to work with. I believe that was due to a difference in priorities and motivation. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable both fall on the team members. At times it would feel like a group of guys hanging out, joking around. At other times it felt like a competition where everyone is only looking out for themselves."

They do not allow their employees to grow and succeed.  They are so busy creating a negative environment and bullying their employees into quitting to avoid unemployment claims.  If management does not like an employee, it becomes a hostile and and the human resources turns a blind eye on the bullying going on.  If an employee is not doing well, they would rather just fire the employee instead of looking into how to help the employee excel and become an exceptional employee.

They do not allow their employees to grow and succeed.  They are so busy creating a negative environment and bullying their employees into quitting to avoid unemployment claims.  If management does not like an employee, it becomes a hostile and and the human resources turns a blind eye on the bullying going on.  If an employee is not doing well, they would rather just fire the employee instead of looking into how to help the employee excel and become an exceptional employee.   I have never witnessed such a low employee morale.  This is the most miserable place to work at and it's heartbreaking to see that first hand."

Right now with the move to Texas, the company is redoing its entire organization chart and compensation for each role. The company also plans to enact mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment which concerns me a bit. Overall it is a great time of uncertainty for anyone that is employed in this organization.

6763,"April 6, 2015",2,average Service director was very inconsistent on his management skills. day to day was very different in his direction and how the service drive and shop would run
6764,"April 6, 2015",4,"Overall a decent place to work Toyota is a great and secure place to work. They used to have best in class pension, benefits and job security. In recent years they have done away with the pension program and have started to pass along the costs of healthcare to their employees. It is still very good right now but they seem to slowly chipping away at the benefits. Right now with the move to Texas, the company is redoing its entire organization chart and compensation for each role. The company also plans to enact mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment which concerns me a bit. Overall it is a great time of uncertainty for anyone that is employed in this organization. Headquarter life is definitely much more balanced than the field office life for the time being. Management can tend to have an old school mentality. Job descriptions are a bit vague and you end up wearing many hats and doing many different things."

The hardest part keeping the survey to a standard rate every month, I can not control what customer can and will do. But if I pushed to the extreme I would know I have some out come of it. The enjoyable part, seeing and hearing a customer about a new vehicle they purchased and what I did or can do to help. I controlled every accept of the dealerships consumers, without customers their would be no dealership."

My co-workers are fun, energetic and knowledgable they are always willing to lend a help hand especially to the hire hires.

I learned maintenance on all forms of forklifts, both big and small. Management keeps poor tabs on it's employees. All co-workers were very enjoyable to work with.

My co-workers are the best part of the job.We come together to accomplish anything we set our minds to.We care for one another as a family. The hard part is when you have four different Groupleaders in ayears time. It is diffacult to know which ends up sometimes. We have two types of management,those that know how and those that only bully. What I have learned here at Toyota is that you should always write everything down that happens on adaily bases.This is to cover your backside,if needed.The thing to remember is that,GOD looks at your heart, nomatter how your company tries to paint your picture. Be true to GOD and yourself"

Great company attitude and I stand by the product they make. The pay is low, management is typically the people who don't mind waiting 5-10 years for the promotion vs the best candidates. If you need a secure job and have no ambitions of quickly advancing or getting a raise then its very fulfilling."

We were given our yearly targets and management went above and beyond to give us the tools to excel.  When I didn't feel challenged I asked for more responsibility and I was leveled up without being overwhelmed. I enjoyed everyone of my co-workers.  They all had a strong sense of professionalism.  I still keep in touch with almost all of them. The hardest part of the job is moving.  I was unable to do that this time. The best part was being a part of the ""Toyota Way""."

Some people do love working there but it is a mill. New sales people this week next week they are gone. Week after week after week not unless you are willing to find a store that can pay you what you earn.

The worst is that there are several of the sales specialists who try to sneak your sales away and give them to other product specialists, management knows they do it, but doesn't care as the sale is made.

7451,"June 14, 2014",3,"Long hours, not a lot of respect. Car sales is a tough business to be in, but at Toyota of Orlando it approaches ridiculous as a product specialist. You typically work a scheduled 55 hour week and management expects you to come in on your days off, there is no protection for your sales, if your customer comes back and someone else talks to them and you are not there, you lose the sale, even if the other person only spent five minutes with them. About 90% of your time is spent outside in the heat and weather, waiting for a customer to come in. The worst is that there are several of the sales specialists who try to sneak your sales away and give them to other product specialists, management knows they do it, but doesn't care as the sale is made. Overall, it could be a great place to work, but there is a lot of major issues that make a tough job even tougher."

Each day yields new challenges, and team members are involved in process improvement ideas. The culture is that of safety first and quality second. Respect for people is what you will find not only in the management areas, but also out on the shop floor. Advancement opportunities are available for all team members who express interest in moving up in the company and who can demonstrate proven leadership abilities. The company is big on team building activities on both company and department levels. The most difficult part of the job is working on the assembly line, as doing repetitious work can be hard on the body. The lines operate on production, so the work day ends when the production number is met, or until the next shift begins. For that reason, the work day hours can be very inconsistent and overtime is normal and accepted. Team members are recognized regularly for improvement ideas in the areas of safety, quality, production, and costs. Toyota is an awesome employer."

When I was hired there was one positive to the company that was quickly removed they did pay for the medical insurance out right but that is a thing of the past.

I believe if a place has good ethics it starts with what the owners are about.  The owners are the most fair and honest people on this earth. The managers also play a big role, as they too are honest and fair to all employees as well as there valued customers.  Working at toyota of vancouver as strange as this may sound brought me closer to god and wish I could have continued to work there but the hardest part of my job was walking.

7984,"September 23, 2013",5,"A great company to work for who values its team members' safety! Though the work days, at times, can be quite long, they are very exciting and unique. Each day yields new challenges, and team members are involved in process improvement ideas. The culture is that of safety first and quality second. Respect for people is what you will find not only in the management areas, but also out on the shop floor. Advancement opportunities are available for all team members who express interest in moving up in the company and who can demonstrate proven leadership abilities. The company is big on team building activities on both company and department levels. The most difficult part of the job is working on the assembly line, as doing repetitious work can be hard on the body. The lines operate on production, so the work day ends when the production number is met, or until the next shift begins. For that reason, the work day hours can be very inconsistent and overtime is normal and accepted. Team members are recognized regularly for improvement ideas in the areas of safety, quality, production, and costs. Toyota is an awesome employer."

The owner has replaced all of the Upper Management in each department and has replaced their loyal and hard workers with cheaper laborers who are struggling to stay above water. There is no raises only empty promises of advancements and raises. When I was hired there was one positive to the company that was quickly removed they did pay for the medical insurance out right but that is a thing of the past. Some of the best managers I ever had the pleasure of working for were fired and replaced with moles within the company all a part of the venezuelan regime.

8306,"February 11, 2013",4,"Fun and challenging work environment The last couple years with Toyota Financial Services have been a very positive experience. The company has demonstrated and taught me the importance of exceeding customer expectations, continual improvement/personal growth, and living the brand in and outside the workplace. Incorporating these values into my job has helped me to find much success with this company, by being within the top 5% of overall sales and quality within my department.A typical day for me includes managing escalation lines to assist other associates with dissatisfied customers and training/coaching others on sales techniques to overcome objections. Another significant aspect of my job includes proactively reaching out to customers approaching their lease end, while having an impacting conversation to retain them and their loyalty by getting them back into our brand for their next vehicle.The hardest part of my job is not having that face to face interaction with the customer like I’m use to. This has taught me a lot about different communication styles and techniques, and has allowed me to have a well rounded experience in dealing with people. The most enjoyable part of my job is being confronted with a wide variety of personalities and situations with each and every interaction. This makes it a fun and challenging environment that allows me to build a positive work relationship with our customers."

When it was time to play, everyone was a seasoned pro. The camraderie there was pretty awesome, and the turnover rate for employees seemed slower than some dealerships.Toyota of Lewisville was a jump into a new industry; and I appreciated their willingness to take a chance on a newbie like me. I saw myself develop strengths I was born with and deal with other aspects of myself that were a bit lacking.I do wish that management had communicated a bit more with me regarding advancement/training opportunities. I took initiative on my own, but did not receive timely feedback."
