"Apr 16, 2021",5.0,"Great company Leaders make an effort to embody the company values, they aren't just words printed on banners. Most leaders understand the importance of schedule flexibility so you can have a healthier work/life balance. The benefits and perks are great.Sometimes corporate structure is disorganized and scattered, you have to inherently know who the right product owners are and loop them in when working on a project, otherwise you may end up isolated and take on most of the work by yourself."

"Jul 18, 2021",1.0,"Another review touting bad managerment Benefits and office perks.Toyota brand name on CV.Very political environment.For a company that thinks it's out in front with its ""values"", I'm shocked at how disrespectful people are to one another. Seems like the higher up you go in people you deal with, the poorer you'll be treated. The Senior Managers I experienced are unorganized, don't understand their business areas, and are otherwise incompetent. But because they work for Toyota they thing they are the best there is.Promotions appear to have been made on groupthink than competency.  It's a country club. Bad leaders surround themselves with more bad leaders because it's what they know.Decisions are made slowly and to personal whims instead of what's best for the company. It's not an efficient environment to work in at all. Plano is not the same as the Toyota manufacturing excellence you hear about.If during the work you're trying to accomplish you go against the gain, retribution is a definitely an outcome."

"Jan 28, 2021",3.0,"It's ok. Not as great as it used to be. Good name on a resume. Nice people. Diverse. Great products and they respect the customer.During and shortly after it moved to Texas, Toyota lost a vast majority of its quality leaders and large numbers of talented employees chose not to move.. Employees became a ""commodity"" and the culture that made the place great was lost with so many new people. So much historical knowledge and competencies were lost as hundreds and hundreds of new people were trying to establish themselves and navigate their new jobs. Benefits were cut significantly, but somehow, people at the top still act as though Toyota offers so much to its employees. But benefits are better at a lot of other Fortune 500s. Also, the culture became more conservative now that it's in Texas."

"May 30, 2021",3.0,"IT division (aka IDS) desperately needs to clean house, but the company overall is good place to work Large company so there's broad range of growth opportunities. It isn't cutthroat. Some of the topdown principles that stem from home office in Japan are impressive  for example, in times of trouble, layoffs of fulltime employees are the absolute last measure considered, rather than the first.IT division in sorry state of affairs. Attempting to transition to Agile, but upper mgt has not adapted, and shows no signs of getting there. The CIO's messaging is that the Agile transition is completed and a success (he’s advertised as much on externally in places like LinkedIn) with ""new, innovative approaches such as having 2 Product Owners for each scrum team, and defining a BSA/QA hybrid role within each scrum development team."" But this is fooling nobody; everyone inside and outside the company knows these things are antithetical to Agile and represent a failure to adopt properly.In fact, CIO relationship with his division is limited to propaganda. For example, there have been at least two failures of massive IT initiatives in the past few years, and there has been no acknowledgement of the failure, let alone communication on how it happened and what upper mgt will do to prevent in future. The CIO hosts 'Town Hall' sessions that do not meet any definition of a Town Hall. i.e. most of it is scripted, and the limited Q&A that is not scripted will only allow questions submitted through instant message, which are screened so no controversial or substantive questions get answered or even shown.Most concerning is that the past 12 months has seen enormous reduction in IT contractor staff, while simultaneously increasing the number and complexity of initiatives. The division has nearly been cut in half. The rationale seems to have been that converting 2 contractor headcount to 1 fulltime headcount will more than double productivity. Needless to say, that has not happened. Combine all of this with attempts to prioritize work in Waterfall fashion, poorly and whilst spinning about any time someone says “squirrel” – the conclusion is upper mgt has everyone’s ends frayed."

"May 11, 2021",3.0,"Agency Employee Beautiful campus with lots of amenities (great lunch options, gym, pharmacy, bank, doctors office)Diverse workforce (Asian, African American, Indian, Women, LGBTQ, Hispanic) and their are great organizations that you can joinBrand recognition. Toyota/Lexus looks great on a resume.As an agency employee that spends majority of my time at the corporate office (preCovid), I think I have a pretty strong perspective.It's extremely hard to move up. People stay in the same roles for 520+ years. You will likely not move up unless someone leaves and unfortunately, people stay in their roles for their entire career, doing the bare minimum but Toyota isn't the type of company to fire people so they know that they're safe and can just ride the wave. It will take you YEARS and YEARS to get a promotion, no matter how hard you work. Yes, there are raises every once in a while (maybe between every1218 months), but who wants to keep doing the same exact work in the same position for 6+ years, raise or not?Japanese culture doesn't have the best worklife balance and everything is always a fire drill. Agencies and contractors need to pump out report after report. They truly treat us like slaves. 1day reports, 3day reports, 10day reports, 15day reports, 30day report. And rarely a thank you or ""I appreciate your hard work."" I'm pretty sure they don't even read them! Just unnecessary work at all times for no rewards. Because of the semitoxic culture, every single corporate employee that I work with seems to have a bit (or a lot) of anxiety. They're always nervous, always rushing, unnecessarily demanding, never having a backbone towards other teams or anyone more senior, always on edge, always kissing a** with other departments. They also very rarely take PTO (awful PTO plan) but it's clear that they all need a break. Also, because a lot of the business works with agencies and contractors, I've found that many of the corporate employees aren't very skilled  they just work as middlemen or babysitters between agencies and contractors and other internal departments. This can be frustrating to have lowerlevel corporate employees trying to approve agency/contractor work but lack experience to do so. They also don't have the best respect, trust, or outlook towards agencies/contractors and treat us as such. We're the ones doing all the work, bending over backward to please you, only for you to get all the credit without even saying thanks! Give us the respect that we deserve! You're no better than us because you work for corporate. Most of us have much stronger work experience than you do and trust us, we don't want in that environment, always being stressed and anxious to the max. Agency / contractor life and culture is ions better."

The pay is good, benefits are fantastic, and coworkers are mostly great. It is mostly younger engineers at the R&D locations and that contributes to a relaxed work environment. I had 3 different managers in my tenure at Toyota and I liked all of them on a personal and professional level. Most employees and lower level management will help out anyone in need. Some interesting projects and career growth opportunities.1) The biggest negative to working at Toyota is the work life balance. This is dependent on department and role but overall if you are an engineer (especially in design), you will be working long hours. In many cases lower level managers are also working large amounts of overtime. There's too much work to go around. This creates a very negative atmosphere during projects and the feeling that there is never enough time to do a good job. The high workload is cyclical in nature so it's not constant but it does take a toll on personal life. 2) For younger engineers or engineers with little experience, there should be a mentormentee relationship. This would get rid of much of the waste that happens when someone new doesn't know how to complete certain tasks. There needs to be more direction given and expectations laid out."

Unfortunately they aren’t able to do their jobs well due to the environment.Toyota does not practice agile, scrum or kanban or anything else lean or agile. Teams work waterfall in an agile environment. People are put in positions that don’t have the skill set for the role. Leadership has not bought into agile and no one is driving the transformation so there are no consequences for refusing to change. Their agile practice group does not coach leadership, scrum masters, product owners or anyone else. They spend time trying to justify their existence by creating PowerPoints and training modules.It’s not uncommon for the manager of the scrum team to be the Product Owner. Sometimes the PO is also a developer. Both of these situations cause conflict of interest and team dysfunction. Leadership does not try to remove organizational impediments. People have become complacent and just go with the status quo instead of trying to promote change and agility thinking.The company is deep rooted in project management type thinking. They don’t want scrum masters but project managers who know a little bit about scrum or have been SM certified. They track enormous amounts of data to generate reports to track progress instead of focusing on business value. They generate multiple roadmaps only to map them back to a project plan with specific dates. Leadership is command and control and trusts no one."

As far as Texas goes, it really seems to have something to offer everyone.  For families and those looking for more suburb type areas, there are places like Frisco, Plano, McKinney, and more.  If you/re looking for more of the urban scene, there are great areas like Uptown and Addison.

We have purchased other franchises and I would give anything to own a Toyota Franchise...not because they build the. Eat cars(which they do)...but because of their love of community and people. They support their dealers  like no other and support them on every level of their business. Their moral compass is straight North and they expect all on their team to have that same level of integrity. I miss Toyota and am doing all I can to be a part of this world class team again.There are NO cons whatsoever working with Toyota or Gulf States Toyota...
"Oct 3, 2019",3.0,"Mobility company or not, our primary focus continues to be cars. I have confidence that I have job security. Unlike domesticbased automakers which hire & layoff their employees in droves, Toyota North America is very stable. However, this also translates to very limited movement, hiring into the company was very difficult even within a trainee program. My manager & senior manager give constructive feedback privately and also recognize my efforts. I feel comfortable to challenge the status quo and offer suggestions to solve problems in new ways.The Plano campus has nice amenities which positively impacts my work input/output.The 401(k) match is okay.Having 'Toyota' on your resume will get you a job almost anywhere else.Corporate Communications strategically blasts Diversity & Inclusion videos when it's time to take your annual harassment training. The company's Diversity & Inclusion efforts are more like forced unconscious bias retraining than actually including people for their diversity.The benefits are marginal compared to the cost of living in my area. HR is resting on the laurels of the benefits offered by the nowdefunct Toyota Motor Sales organization. Cost of living in north Dallas has risen substantially since Toyota completed their campus here, HR needs to reevaluate their offered base salaries to the north Dallas area. I don't expect to drive a new Toyota or eat out regularly, and it's difficult to keep my head above water being a somewhat recent college graduate.Employee discount on Toyota vehicles is a joke, I can negotiate a better deal on a dealer lot as a regular customer on a Toyota vehicle. Toyota has continued to slip against the competition in JD Power on vehicle telematics; yet our Connected Technologies department continues to be understaffed & we're one of the last automakers to add Apple Carplay to our product line.  If you have an Automotive Degree, look for another company. Quality managers from old TEMA groups continue to pick candidates with Engineering Technology degrees that do not have practical automotive knowledge."

There are divisions that are still true to TPS/Toyota Way and practice it to the best of their abilities Any concerns regarding HR is quickly addressedSenior Executives are very open and make themselves readily available (they place themselves across campus in open collaboration areas to allow people to bounce ideas off)Direction of the company was once bumpy but you can see they are addressing many of the issues with strategic initiatives. Most divisions have a morale committee and team building   a general investment in wanting to make sure employees are happy Encourages you to challenge those around you and solve problems in your daily work. Innovation/Tech fairs to bring out ad hoc projects that team members are working on that could benefit the company as a whole. Work/life balance is amazing  you can flex your time and work from home. Benefits are great! Paid volunteer time and heavy community emphasis.Like all companies, we still have things to work on: Need to go back to the original intent of the founders  lowest level employees are the most important, I see that has gotten away where middle management is where the investment/opportunities are.Investments on campus are done primarily on flash and not training (Balloon Arch vs. Agile SCRUM training, most people would rather have the training) but are often told it's not in the budget or you can't be ""lent"" for more than 1 hour by management. Like most companies  your Manager can make or break your career at TMNA unfortunately .You're far from the final product  the closest plant is 5 hours away. General lack of understanding of incoming professionals (Millennial's and Gen Z) and there's really no push to understand it seems either. In a generation that believes in quick movements for a successful career, TMNA isn't adapting.  Respect means different things to different generations and that's largely getting ignored as well.

"Sep 24, 2019",1.0,"Quality Trainee Program= Total Bust 1. There is a lot of prestige working for a company such as Toyota. It's a great resume builder. But a simple intern should suffice. 2.  Toyota does offer great benefits. But I will prefice this that the other offers that I received out of college were higher than Toyota. I turned down a higher paying salary for preceved opportunity.  3. Their work is challenging and rewarding.1. I was hired as an Automotive Technical Trainee out of college. I worked hard for two years and interviewed for multiple jobs within my department. Unfortunately, I was passed up multiple times, but was assured by management that I would be retained for more rotations as a trainee. I patiently waited (with other automotive trainees) to be placed into a quality or service support role. After two years of hard work, and relocating to Texas, and training for a position within PQ&SS I was notified by email (not in person) that I needed to find my next opportunity elsewhere. Two years of my life I will never get back. 2. The pay structure at Toyota is hourly. In most rotations I was paid for the work that I did. However, in my last rotation as a Trainee I was denied overtime, however the expectation was a full workload. I worked many hours of overtime without being compensated. This is money that I will never see. Don't expect their hourly pay structure to be evenly distributed. 3. The quality trainee program within Toyota is a total disaster. The management within PQ&SS does not promote within. This program no longer works as a method of attaining a legitimate job within the quality ranks. Management also never addressed us personally, and actually lied to questions that trainees had regarding the state of affairs. We were lead to believe there were legitimate opportunities. When stuff really hit the fan  no one was accountable  and I was addressed by a lousy email. 4. If you are considering the quality trainee program or PQ&SS in general I would strongly urge you to reconsider. There are much better opportunities out there."

You might not always like who you work for, but getting the job done, as a team, makes it all worth while."
"Jun 20, 2019",1.0,"Good money and benefits, just don't expect to move up without LOTS of overtime. Good SalaryGood BenefitsLooks good on a resume, until you realize that no one will hire you because you make more than they pay, or that they are a hiring service that has a contract with Toyota not to pull from them.Quantity of work is valued far more than quality. Promotions in position are impossible, and raises are incredibly difficult to get without working lots of overtime to give the impression of ""Going above and beyond""Technician role is very siloed, as opposed to engineering role where you can rotate between departments. Many advantages given to engineers simply aren't there for technicians, but technicians are expected to make up for the lack of experience in engineers.Management is similarly inexperienced and put into position simply by the appearance of leadership capability, not actual ability. I have actually heard my manager say to me ""If you need technical help, you'll have to find it yourself, I don't know how."" This goes very against the training you receive initially of ""stop, call and wait"" if you need help. To make things more difficult, especially in the weld area, Toyota uses proprietary equipment and software, so you can't just Google it or call a supplier. If management or engineering can't help, you simply have to figure it out on your own. If the only help to be had is in another department, it is almost impossible to get. There are no resources to help with that."

Most of the supervisors are also very degrading because they will change your decision if a customer is screaming at them enough. They will lie to you in the beginning and say that you will only have to be there for a year before you're eligible for promotions but in actuality most people don't leave the department unless they've been there for 20 years or have a master's degree.Under no circumstances are you allowed to disconnect the call even if you are being belittled cursed out or insulted.If you are able to find a supervisor they will instruct you to place the customer on hold and wait until the customer just hangs up.The computers are very old like Windows 7 old and even though my computer was rebooting it took a month to get a replacement.Your schedule changes every 4 weeks yet they want you to preplan a doctor's appointment and things of that nature well ahead of time.You also are expected to request your vacation at the beginning of the year if not good luck getting it approved.The food in the kitchen is very expensive but very bland. The parking lot on the Southeast side is literally impossible and you will often be late for work just because you can't find a parking spot.If you are a woman you will be approached by someone eventually about your attire whether it be something as small as a head wrap or open toed shoes. They even sent someone home for wearing ugg boots!! Ridiculous.Overall just a very uptight corporate environment.

TMMK is Toyota's largest North American plant and can be an excellent place to gain experience in high speed manufacturing.  The pay is often above average and Toyota is well respected global company.  Toyota is also known for being highly selective and just being hired by them is a plus on your resume.Few opportunities for advancement exist.   While I was there, they hired almost exclusively through temporary services and I personally worked with other temps who had be there for up to 7 years.  For nearly 3 years, they hired no one at all.  I can say with almost absolute certainty if you are hired as a temporary, you have almost no chance of becoming fulltime.  If you are able to survive the hiring process which includes working a minimum of 2 years as a temp with no benefits what so ever or days off other than plant shut downs to get hired, you'll have to start over at the bottom of the seniority ladder.  Keep in mind that vacation time is assigned by clock number and TMMK has over 6,000 employees.  In other words, you wouldn't get first pick of a day off for nearly a decade if then.TMMK's senior management seemed disconnected and on occasion unprofessional.  I can recall several meetings with senior management in which managers stopped the meeting to take cell phone callsoften personal ones.

With the company going through a transitional time with the move to Plano, there is much opportunity to grow and develop your skill sets across the company.  Senior Management is extremely knowledgeable and open to helping the new generation of employees grow and learn more about the automotive industry.  Highly recommend this company.  I moved all the way from sunny LA to Dallas for this job and the career potential.  So far, no regrets.  Also, the new campus in Plano is incredible.

I took a significant pay cut to come there, and it was only partially made up for by the very good (not excellent) benefits.There is little recourse if you're not happy with your current work.  I told multiple managers many times what I enjoyed doing, versus what I was not interested in doing, and didn't feel like I was being heard.If you get a bad manager, woe be to you.  You will have little recourse, other than transferring to another department, or quitting.  The HR department is basically useless, and the people there are changed like socks. So even if you educate them on a situation, they won't be around long enough to do anything about it or help you out."

The campus is huge and there is a large gym with clean facilities. Overall the company has a soul and cares about its employees and customers deeply.Cafeteria and campus cafes are pricy!

"Jul 30, 2018",5.0,"Fantastic, reliable, and progressive company! After 10.5 years at Toyota, I've had 4+ different managers and every one of the has been fantastic. Kind, easy to talk to, knowledgeable and willing to help.  Diverse and understanding work environment with a focus on safety for everyone. Work life balance is top notch. Flexible in/out times and flexible on personal time if you have something that needs attention outside of work. Toyota also does a great job looking out for their employees! No one was fired during the market downturn a while back, benefits that we had to give up for a while have slowly made their way back. Overtime is paid, which is unheard of for engineers. I wouldn't have left if I didn't have to!Late night meetings are normal (12 times per week) due to the need to meet with our counterparts in Japan. But management realizes this is a little unfair so will often only require attendance if there is a direct need for you to be there. There is also sometimes a language and/or cultural barrier that can make work difficult but it's not that difficult to get used to and is often better than the environment you'll face at other companies. Annual pay raise isn't great, but I think that's typical. Need a promotion for a decent bump. They also did change their promotion process recently that makes it a bit more difficult to get promotions since they have to open up and be interviewed for as if they were a new position in the company. However, this may have an impact on normal pay raises in a positive way in that they may be more merit based. I wasn't around long enough after the policy change to confirm."
"Sep 11, 2014",5.0,"Some Travel but a lot of interaction with dealer and field personnel. Excellent benefits, extremely stable company even during the economic downturn. One of very few companies to keep associates at the HQ level and at the slower non producing plants during this time. Good Pension great 401k and a lots of opportunity for growth. Some travel in this position but very well keeps it interesting. Excited about the new products and supporting various departments and field personnel a plus.Moving to Texas is one issue. Personal growth is dependent on the person and not really the company but they do encourage movement in the company and field experience."
"Mar 25, 2016",5.0,"A Great Career Being part of a culture of continuos improvement created tremendous learning opportunities as we solved both strategic and daily problems to build competitive advantage in satisfying customers and sustained profitable growth.It's really an upside for the company and employees who are empathetic enough to understand and live Toyota's unwavering values and guiding principles and work collaboratively with Lean Systems Thinking in the continuous pursuit of perfection of the entire extended enterprise.  The ""con"" is that in the sales company there was no formal training program for this, so some employees struggle and are frustrated when outcomes of their work do not achieve their expectations."
"Mar 20, 2014",4.0,"Very Fun Job Managers know what they are doing. There is a ton of training and no one is uptight like I've experienced at other shops. I've wanted to go back just for the people. The environment is always friendly and never stressed. If you mess up, they help you instead of blame you. Just don't do it more than  3 timesPay is too low. Lot's of construction always going on and you have to get there 30 min early just to park a half mile down the road and wait for a shuttle in muddy water. Not my favorite"
"Oct 1, 2009",5.0,"Wonderful company to co-op with, awesome co-workers, great environment. Management was wonderful and all specialists within our group were extremely helpful.  They gave me responsibilities of a full time employee, even though I was a coop, which included various projects and assignments.It was difficult to request time off because of work assignments that had to be completed during certain times of the month.  Some days, when we travel during the day, you may be away from home for 12 hours."
"Mar 10, 2017",4.0,"Good but could be better Solid company, has a good plan for the future. Standard pay and benefits for a Fortune 500 company.

Constantly reducing or eliminating benefits and perks. Wants top 50 talent and dedication but only compares pay and benefits to top 500 companies."

Company to be proud of, benefits, many locations should you choose to transfer, history of company is positive, community involvement both local and global is amazingPush for next goals sometimes over shadow current successes, would prefer company share their community involvement both local and globally more than they do so people are aware of their many contributions, better coordination of group efforts between sponsorships at all levels, more communications between regions."
"Mar 13, 2016",4.0,"Excellent company going through changes with the upcoming move to Plano, Texas in 2017 Great benefits, friendly people, good work/life balance.

Field sales experience is valued over  strategic thinking and strong business management practices and expertise."
"Feb 9, 2013",2.0,"Used to be a great place to work Good benefits, Great job security if you are a team member, tuition reimbursement, They try to be team oriented, great diverse work force.Individual manager have far to little discretion in the enforcement of HR policy. Team member relations(TMR)  group in HR per management direction makes, policy making and project work the priority over TMR. Toyota touts respect for people as a major pillar of there corporate mission, but then makes policies that treat people like numbers. They have far too many variable workforce (VWF). When we went through the economic trial of 0910. My division didn't get rid of a single VWF, but in the aftermath they have only hired on 1 of those VWF. Clearly they are needed and yet head count can't be spared."
"Oct 30, 2014",4.0,"Excellent company with great benefits! A strong company with many, many talented people.

This causes a huge black hole in project approvals, direction, budget, etc. Lack of people skills causes undue and unnecessary slowdowns in productivity."
"Nov 7, 2017",4.0,"Great company that takes care of team members! Tons of perks  car discounts, yearend shutdown (for many divisions), amazing health benefits, the new HQ campus has tons of onsite perks, etc.Culture and organizational values are firstclass and what makes the company so great.Incredibly stable organization.Not a ton of clear direction on career path  while the tenure of employees is long, it's hard to know how exactly to move around within the organization.

Most all of Toyota owners, own and drive only Toyota and will not switch manufacturers. Customer base also loyal to maintaining their vehicles at the dealership and most do all necessary maintenance and repairs to vehicles.Not necessarily a con but the vehicles run so well that there isn’t an overwhelming amount of business involving serious repairs. There is enough to make a good living and being they rarely need repairs , customers are willing to to do necessary services and preventative maintenance to the vehicles to keep them running repair free."

"Sep 29, 2016",4.0,Great Company.  Outdated Leadership Company benefits and perks.Many opportunities to try new things if you know the right people. Executive leadership generally transparent.Management very resistant to try anything new.Fast follower corporate mindset.Low morale in many parts of the company.
"Nov 21, 2016",4.0,"Love working here, the people are easy to work with and very few micro managers. Benefits are great.  People are nice.  They encourage process improvement.  Flexible work/life through generous vacation and holidays.  The car lease is really nice as well.Not a lot upward mobility.  Senior Analyst level is really management level in most companies.  It helps to be male to move up."

Good working conditions, mixture of ages & backgrounds, excellant  benefits.They want to appear to listen to the people, but too often the management feel they know what needs to be done.

"Sep 7, 2015",4.0,"Good culture but large traditional company I was in a unique position in research and development. I learned a lot and had quite a few responsibilities.  The culture was unique and learning and practicing ""the toyota way"" can help shape good engineering thought proceses.At times the promotion of ""toyota way"" was heavyhanded and only slowed things down. Also it's a traditional company so you don't move up quickly through the ranks despite positive reviews.  You have to deal with all of the traditional troubles of working for huge multinational that is difficult to change. Center of power for certain things still rests in Japan."
"Dec 18, 2016",5.0,"Great employer, Good Pay/Benefits Toyota really cares about its team members. They live by the respect for people value. People are hard working, intelligent and genuinely good people. Good worklife balanceThe retirement and relocation benefits are not nearly as good for new hires as they are for the team members hired before the Plano announcement. Could be more competitive."
"Apr 1, 2014",4.0,"Fierce Competition. The most important things I learned at Toyota were the ability to negotiate and how to pick up on customer nuances.  Selling automobiles is one of the most difficult sales you'll ever make so to do it well, repeatedly, makes a way for your selling muscles to flex.Not doing well and getting blown out for lack of production.  Being intimidated by others in the sales force.  Not making enough money to pay your bills because you have yet to succeed as being a closer."

Their current location in Torrance is very comfortable and nicely laid out (too bad they are leaving it).  There are a lot of opportunities (or there were a lot of opportunities before the downsizing and moving the headquarters to Texas.  But it served as a good place to work a few years ago.  The company lease is a great benefit too.They say they care about the work/life balance, but if that was the case they would think more about the employees as family and not as numbers or as something that can be tossed w/the trash.  There is a possibility that the new hires will no longer get the matching 401K, but that is something that most companies are doing now.  Just look into what benefits are now available to new hires."
"Feb 11, 2015",4.0,Excellent corporate goals. Benefits are excellent as well as the company paid money purchase plan. The 401K system is a 2/3 match up to 4%. I.E. contribute 6% and they will add 4%.Training and the promotion process are completely broken in TX. Hourly employees get very little access to training due to the demand to be on the floor. Salaried employees don't have it much better.

Sometime we ask them a question and they take weeks sometimes months to come with the answer."

There's absolutely no stress involved with jobs at Toyota. Great work life balance. Excellent company culture.Very low pay. Almost impossible to get promoted because promotion is based on openings, and no one ever leaves Toyota. The job is too easy and stressfree to quit. Promotion is also based on who you know and not how you perform. Lots of corporate politics. Many of the younger employees' (i.e., MTs) parents work at TMS as Corporate Managers or higher. Half of them would never get promoted if it wasn't for daddy's connections."

Great benefits with competitive pay.Very conservative corporate culture.  Performance appraisal system is based on relative performance (with quotas) rather than individual performance based; unnecessary at  best and demoralizing at worst, for both associates and managers.

You can be confident in job security there have been no layoffs at the Georgetown assembly plant since it opened in the late 80's.Very few opportunities for advancement within the company.

There is also an on site doctor's office, dentist, and optometrist.The biggest con is lack of work/life balance. TMMTX adheres to an absolutely brutal shift work schedule where you work two weeks days then switch to two weeks nights.  Your body and soul takes a beating because you never get used to the change.  You can count on working some Saturdays as well. The on site medical facilities are nice in theory but good luck getting an appointment."

"Aug 22, 2018",3.0,"Toyota is a great place to work if you want to retire....not if you want to grow Toyota has some of the best benefits I have ever seen at a company. The lease car alone is a huge plus and managers and above get a stipend for a lease car. This essentially allows for a free car for managers and above. I have the most expensive medical plan and it costs me roughly $75 a month. I am single with no dependents. Retirement plan is pretty decent. Not the best but still good. The people at Toyota truly do care about the company. They want to see it succeed.  Management have an loyalty to the company that I have not seen anywhere else.  Mostly this works out for good.  What Toyota is doing as a whole company is pretty inspiring . When you see Akio talking about mobility it is exciting. The company as a whole is doing some very interesting things with mobility and connected world.Toyota does amazing things for the community. The partnerships they have with community and the sheer number of volunteer opportunities is the best I have ever seen from a company.  People inside Toyota care about making a difference in the community and it is built into the culture. Also the business partnering groups are diverse and give employees other opportunities to use their talents.Toyota is not a good place to be innovative. They talk about it all the time but everything is marred in red tape.  The bureaucracy and politics at Toyota are the absolute worst I have ever seen. I work in the IT department and in order to get a basic server it takes at least 4 approvals and then about a 2 weeks to work itself through the system. The discussions of SCRUM and Agile are all talk. They have just changed the names and do the same type of workflow. The largest complaint is that team members are unable to properly do their jobs because all of the IT operations are outsourced to a third party company. Toyota is extremely, extremely siloed. If you are a technical person who wants to be hands on then I would highly recommend not applying at Toyota. Team member positions are mostly glorified project managers. You will just be managing projects and give requirements to other teams to do the job that more than likely you can do yourself but cannot do because they will not give you access."

There were many trips to LA to testdrive new vehicles and a requirement to complete numerous online training classes that were very well written and provided a lot of information.Toyota doesn't have much markup so the pay isn't fantastic.  The management and environment at the dealership was horrible.  You can't trust anyone to help you or be on your side.  The managers and owner are no exception.

Excellent coworkers for the most part.Middle management often doesn't have a clue and they are gatekeepers between the hardworking, capable employees and the senior execs. Lack of advancement opportunities. Employees often get fed up and leave for other companies and then the same level of managers is shuffled from department to department.

Kind of like a union steward with no union. An employee of the company. Who does what the company wants without listening to real facts! And they don't adhere to their nonretaliation policy!

"Jun 14, 2018",2.0,"Not One Toyota...TMS run Toyota Good base salary plus overtime, good medical benefits, reasonable bonus plan, auto lease plan is ok (TEMA plan was much better before One Toyota Initiative an move to Texas).  Finally trying to implement SAP.Lip service paid to being One Toyota.  At least in accounting and finance it is the old TMS guard running the show and imposing their way of doing things. When openings become available, if it is a department run by certain TEMA executives the jobs are posted and interviews are performed before position is filled.  In areas that are run by old TMS executive hand picked people are placed in open potions based on who they know rather then what they know.  Also it appears that there is a desire to have most SR Managers come from Old TMS guard rather then promoting individuals from TEMA.  Other differences are in how jobs were developed, TEMA developed jobs base on manufacturing lean process that assumes a minimum work week is 45 hours whereas old TMS jobs were designed to be completed in a 40 hour work week.  Implementing SAP by trying to replicate old manual processes and treating it as a replacement of PeopleSoft system that is basically used as a GL system rather then implementing SAP as a fully integrate ERP system.  To mean seams like a waste of $$$$$$.  Either implement right and fix issues rather than trying to show horn in broken processes just because “...it’s the way it’s always been done.”Company states that they are all about the people, yet their action show they are more worried about profit level. Case in point currently facing major budget cuts because North America wasn’t as profitable in FY18 as in previous years.  This is funny that they explain away the fact that Toyota as a whole showed profit growth over the same period, and explain it as mostly related to FX.  Guess what this is normally what causes the most fluctuation in international company’s profits and most of the time these companies are happy when it is positive rather then trying to spin it as doom and gloom."
"Aug 10, 2010",3.0,"Use to be a better place to work, but still not bad compared to other automotive mfg's. Stable, solid, dependable background of keeping employees.  Very little hiring/firing once you are inside (However, this is also a detriment  see below).  Toyota has been much more stable over the years compared to GM, Ford, or Chrysler certainly.  Toyota has equivalent or better benefits in comparison to other automotive oe's.Employees (called ""Associates) are treated with respect, and typically granted a lot of leeway provided they are producers.Great facilities  nice campus, great food, credit union and other services.Top management has lost it's way.  Toyota is not necessarily a big ship clearly headed in the right direction under strong leadership as in the past.  A substantial amount of current leadership really got to their positions via politicking and positioning themselves by making powerful friends more than actually being the most skilled and knowledgeable.  That is starting to show.  The problem is worse at individual department manager leadership, where Toyota tends to shift management in frequently (every 23 years) from not very closely related areas (again based on chummy favoritism over skill set) that aren't experts in the product and therefore tend to be listless/feckless leaders.  Toyota clearly should do more promoting from within departments.  Subject matter experts abound, but they are used as ""nice tools"" until they realize they aren't going to be promoted over the politically savvy but technically weak  and they leave.  Toyota has suffered from a talent drain over the past 10 years and it appears to be gaining momemtum  a bad sign for the company.  Basically, top management seems to think good managers come from reading books on management and attending seminars and applying the general management theories they learn.  It's not working.  They need to retain and promote people truly interested and knowledgeable in their product and their market  and push the sappy generalists to the side.As I mentioned,  there is a talent drain from Toyota  however it remains a good, solid company to work for to pull down a decent salary.  Therefore, a lot of nonperformers never leave.  And, Toyota seems to be very soft in dealing with them.  Every department is filled with about 25% ""post office mentality"" people that feel they deserve a job at Toyota, have a general distrust of management, and are more concerned about their benefits on a daily basis than performance on their job.  IN fact, many seem more apt to argue and bicker and push away responsibility.  They are not punished for this behavior.  In fact, the general feeling among nonmanagers is ""work hard, be better, or not....you will get the same steady average raise"".  Toyota needs to change that fast."

Salary is fair, but on the low end.Promotion opportunities are limited unless you are willing to relocate. Work life balance is difficult due to travel and constant dealer attention."
"Jan 13, 2016",4.0,"Specialist - Engineering Incredible job security, competitive pay/OT/bonus, takes care of employees.Advancement/promotion can be very slow, hours can be long, work can be unevenly distributed among employees, lots of travel depending on your department/role."

Salaries are most likely the lowest in the auto industry; if you can live with that then I highly recommend Toyota."
"Jan 12, 2013",3.0,"Toyota, MS Pay is on par with area plant is located. Not great, but not below other manufacturing plants in the area.Middle management is HORRENDOUS!!!!! Lot of Texas group leaders who came to MS treating people as if we had just crossed the border from Mexico. Promotions are very political and are not based on knowledge or seniority. Who you befriend of kiss up to is how you are promoted. Not really a union person, but a union is definitely needed  as soon as possible before any more growth is done."

"Nov 3, 2015",3.0,"Long hours, stress, but, decent pay for those who can stand the grind. You can make as much or as little money as you want. I found that Toyota vehicles have a very low customer loyalty & it was difficult to get referrals and turn 'bebacks' into commission.Long grueling hours, high turnover, roller coaster pay, unconventional environment, highs and lows emotionally, sometimes unfair practices between sales people and management."
"Nov 27, 2015",4.0,"Engineer Good on the job training on basic principles of TPS.

There are many good people at the company trying to do good things.It's a very difficult time in the organization.  They've gone through an internal merger which has caused chaos.

Management is great at management, but few are true leaders with a vision.  People who do good, hard work are overshadowed by butt kissers and showy types.  TEMA is not the place for you if you are the humble, softspoken type.  Very few (if any at all) types of intrinsic rewards are available."
"Oct 29, 2014",4.0,TMS IT Department Great learning experience which would have taken years to achieve in an academic setting.Too many layers of management so lower level managers become very frustrated and can't always accomplish their goals and objectives.

Health benefits including on site medical, dentist, optometrist & physical therapy even a pharmacy with less out of pocket expense for you. Had my job when many were getting laid off.  Was told of my schedule (2 week rotation) many times over BEFORE getting hired & was informed it WAS NOT going to change. When hired during orientation we were told DO NOT base life on OT as it comes & goes. This info was extremely useful in making my decison to work here or pass. Love company family day @ Fiesta TexasSafety Shoe Distributor are the worst EVER! ! Not just the shoe but the people in charge of it  really blow. Caprice Uniform can't seem to get your size right you can order the same size 5 years & every year the size or bigger or smaller than the year before even though all tags have same size personally i think they change tags when they run out of the size that was ordered they won't take it back then we gotta pay out of our pocket which makes them more money. Aramark has got to go expensive for the crapppiest food. Can't complain about rotation due to fact that we knew about this before hand BUT it is not easy on body or mind as i tend to forget what day it is when working nights. Not sure why former employee would worry about the new proposed schedule if they no longer there but there was another option. Keeping fingers crossed for option #2."

They want all of the IT people to relocate to Plano, TX, therefore Toyota will not be able to get the best people for the IT positions. The housing market in Plano is highpriced and competitive, effectively causing a pay cut, so the best people will not move out there.Management does not understand IT and thinks that they can run the company with inexperienced and incompetent outsourced staff from CSC."

"Feb 20, 2009",2.0,"Great plant but has a lot of growing up to do. Great nonexempt workforce.  Never had a more satisfying experience than working with the T/M's that build the product.Toyota as a whole is built on good fundamentals and the experience is challenging.This is the second Toyota Manufacturing Plant I have worked at.  Regarding TMMI, I feel the exempt culture at this plant is missshaped compared to other Toyota facilities working the Toyota Way.I notice that the relationship between Managers/A.M.s and Specialists is quite heavyhanded if not adversarial at times.  This is really evident in their H.R. policies which are very conservative compared to other plants and lack any definition or flexibility.  H.R. policies at this plant are applied very inconsistently.Leadership communication is usually one way and very top down.  TMMI middle managers are very perception driven and I see terrific opportunities wasted because of politics and narrow focus.  Again not typical of other Toyota plants.  I see rush to judgement and reaction that is often not thought through.  This only serves to tear down the stability of the processes and not strengthen them.This plant has an excellent professional workforce but I see the Specialists often spun in every direction with little opportunity to give their work the time required to do it right with a lasting contribution. Very high expectations placed on Specialists here with very few rewards.On the whole, this plant has it's priorities straight on the floor and builds good product but in the office culture has a lot of growing left to do.  I see this management team having benefited from years of good sales and not really knowing if what they did all these years served the better purpose or not."

"Jun 11, 2015",1.0,"Get head out of sand Are there any pros left?  I suppose the next couple of years they are still in California is  last 'Pro'I hope a lot of 'Team Members' are reading this..1.  TMS does not want ANY Band 2 employees to go to Plano.  This is evidenced by the low relocation package being offered.  Band 2 level employees are considered 'unskilled' workers.  The band 2 employees are paid A LOT of money compared to the same jobs at other companies in LA.  TMS knows they can fill these positions in Plano and pay 60 % less.  The reality:  it will hit TMS like a ton of bricks  there are SO many Band 2 positions that SHOULD be Band 3 positions.. There are associates that have been in their job for 1520 years and the job has evolved into a highly skilled job.. Band 2's will fight to have their job changed to a band 3 but TMS won't budge. They use the excuse that you need a BA to be promoted to a Band 3...  This is a ridiculous argument... Some people were not able to go back to However they know the job better than anyone...  I have seen band 2s retire after 30 years with the company and they have changed that person's job to a Band 3 position.. They would NEVER promote a band 2 (someone in the dept) instead they would hire someone outside the company...  Unreal.   But it doesn't matter now.. They are doing their best to get rid of Band 2s.. But will be shocked to find out how much skill many Band 2s have...  They will be shocked to find out how difficult it is to find people with degrees in the DalSorry Band 2s.. You're gend of the stick.  Ask for a 'buy out' NOW.. They will DO it.  I know this for a fact!!  TMS is just using you..  They want the 'perfect' scenario until they move to Texas.. They want ALL associates to STAY to the end so they can move the operation... Then I am amused to see SO many people JUMP ship in the last year.... I see departments STRUGGLING to keep afloat.  They are having a difficult time hiring people  as you know it takes FOREVER to hire 1 person.. Now they have to hire MANY people.. They just don't have 34 months to hire 1 person anymore.  That's their problem.  Senior management has had their head in the sand thinking that everyone would stay until they end.  Maybe if their weren't so many MEAN and HORRIBLE managers out there these associates may have stayed loyal until the end...  Senior management has no idea how many inept, mean, horrible band 4s and band 5s are in the organization.  Human resources knows how many bad managers are out there! They are the ones who hear the complaints  but HR has So now you have many people leaving the company.... Now there is an imbalance in the departments... In some cases Band 2s are doing 3 jobs  2 of those jobs are band 3 jobs.  It seems it is OK for band 2s to DO the work of Band 3s but not be promoted or given the $$ that they should get.  Obviously this proves that you don't always need a BA to do a job...  Believe me I can easily get a BA 'online' from some substandard school and it has NOTHING TO do with the current job I'm doing.Band 2s  ask for a BUYOUT and MOVE on!2. The other group that TMS wants to get rid of is Band 4 managers  these guys are WAY OVER PAID...  I know many many managers who are making over $140,000.00   That's because they have been with the company 25 plus years.. They get HUGE bonus (15k20k)..  They have HUGE pensions...   Band 4s  are expensive... And as we all know (especially the band 2 and band 3s) they don't do a lot.  They are not in the daily production, they aren't doing the 'work'.  When a Band 4 goes on vacation for 3 weeks no one notices... When a Band 2 or 3 goes on vacation for a WEEK  EVERYONE notices!!   TMS doesn't need Band 4s.  They want to get rid of the HUGE payroll liability.   Band 5s can handle the 'managing' of the departments until TMS hires band 4s in Plano for a fraction of the salary that these band 4s were making in Torrance..  So long Band 4s....3.  The ONE group that TMS needs is the Band 3 group.  These associates are actually paid a little less than the market in LA and have great credentials.   I have many friends are TMS who are CPAs with their MBA from big schools like USC.  They could be making MORE money at Sony or a Downtown firm  but wanted the lifestyle at TMS.. So Toyota has been very very lucky in attracting these amazing people.... But these people had no idea that TMS would move to Texas.  These over qualified Band 3a do NOT need to go to Texas.  They are highly sought after employees in the LA market.   TMS needs these highly skilled associates to go to Texas..  They need them to keep the business running.  They are perfect for TMS  they aren't hugely overpaid like Band 4s.. They have big credentials (unlike band 2s) and they do most of the skilled work.  THIS is the group that TMS needs to keep the business running in Texas  and they are getting the most attractive relo package of all"

Work was as expected and with chances to get into project management though it was slim chance and getting on as a fulltime employee.Leadership is nonexistent nor helpful. I sought out feedback periodically and always told, ""don't worry, you are doing fine, we take things very slow, have patience"",  no problem for me. The office is extremely cliquish. Never felt comfortable by management or most staff. Some coworkers were helpful that was the only bright spot, most were inexperienced college grads who believe they know everything, I tried my best to provide mentoring for CAD software of which they knew little to no avail. I was told in my interview we find your strengths and build upon them....that statement was a joke as I look back. I strive to be a professional at my job, since I could not get work and projects assigned very often. I created my own as there was plenty of voids to be filled. Getting back to management, I read a survey when I started and attended a meeting to review the results. Some comments from other employees stood out prominently, ""How did you become a manager with the very little experience"" or ""Were you good at your previous job, maybe you should consider going back to it"". I took those as cynical comments, but they do have merit for who made them. Both managers I worked for sporadically communicated on what to work on which shows poor communication skills. Being new to this environment I was given reassurance of being sent to training  to pick up on a CAD package and being told to get cost for training. After getting cost, I was then told to plan to learn under another contractor who knew the software well. That was a mistake since this person was not willing to train or teach since they saw this as a threat to their job (verified by two other office employees on their poor training/teaching abilities)."

If you work as a contractor for Toyota, you will be harrassed and discriminated by supervisors and in a more subtle way, by management. Once you become a team member, you can be as lazy and unprofessional as you want. As long as you are a team member, Toyota never fires you. If you make some mistake or do something wrong all you get is a slap on the hand. Therefore it's a great place to work long term if you are unskilled and have no ambitions, because you will have a job guaranteed for life, regardless of how many mistakes you make. Management is not flexible at all, and they don't have the slightest clue of how everyday problems are solved. I saw how team members who worked, say, in human resources were offered key positions in, say, production (or some other completely unrelated area) even if they did not have the skills. On the other hand, contractors who had the skills for filling an open position were never offered the chance to become team members  the golden elite who can never get fired . If you are creative, or want to grow or do things in a different way (even if it reduces costs and is more efficient), forget it. At Toyota everything is done ""by the book"". The problem is some of their procedures are already obsolete."
