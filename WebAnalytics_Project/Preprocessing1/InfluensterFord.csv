0, 4 days ago,5,Just wanted to show off my car. I am so happy that I got this car even though ford's be having mental breakdowns sometimes. But she is a beauty. My 2018 ford fusion. I love that it runs both electric and gas.
1, 4 days ago,5,I have a 2020 Ford fusion hybrid. And I came across these cute covers for the Chi fives off of Amazon. And I absolutely love how it looks. I love the bling out my car and my accessories. And thanks Amazon I found this amazing key fob caseAmazon Prime ￼
2, 10 days ago,5,My Ford F-150 fx4 not only a comfortable ride but all the safety features work exactly as stated when someone hit us. Ford crew cab trucks are great if you travel with dogs with the seats folded up there’s plenty of room for everyone.
3, 11 days ago,5,I love Ford's wide range of vehicles from the sedan to a workhorse truck ( F-150 ) and Ford keeps on adding touches of elegance here and there in every vehicle. Henry Ford Himself Would Be Very Proud Today. 
4, 11 days ago,3,This was my first car I bought when I was 18! It gave me trouble ever since the first month. I needed a transmission so I had to get rid of it! I got it for real cheap and regretted it! I will never get a Ford ever again!
5,24 days ago,5,"We are a family of Ford truck owners! We have 2 Ford F-150 trucks & I refuse to purchase anything but Ford. This is good quality & American made. These trucks have NEVER given us any issues.  So, why would we go with anything else? LOVE Ford vehicles! Always will repurchase!"
6, 2 months ago,5,"Always owned ford's my whole life. Started off with a mustang, now with a brand new 150. Love them keeps my family safe."
7, 2 months ago,5,Had a 97 Expedition that we loved! We had it for almost 20 yrs. we bought it used. Took us on a few trips from Chicago to Florida. So much room! We called it the couch. It was a very smooth ride. We could never afford a new one but if we ever could we’d get another one in a heartbeat.
8, 3 months ago,5,"Dear Ford: PLEASE re manufacture cars like the 2008 Ford Focus SE. I just sold it to a mechanic who can keep up the maintenance on it more than me and she was just at 207,000 miles. I drove her off the lot with only 26 miles and I know I’ll never have a car like her again. This car and I went cross country more times than I can count, and she went to Canada multiple times too. I loved this car. Period."
9, 3 months ago,5,"I have a 1999 Ford F-150 4 wheel drive truck that I would not trade for anything. Well, my dream car and is a Ford Mustang convertible it has been a dream car to me since I was a kids and one day I hope I will have that dream come true, "
10, 3 months ago,5,"I bought a 2006 ford focus back in 2006. This car has lasted me until 9/2021. Talks about longevity. It works and runs like a champ. Obviously with anything, it needs maintenance. But otherwise, runs like it will keep going for another 10 years or more. "
11, 3 months ago,5,I currently have a F250 turbo that I did chip and put a tuner on but I absolutely love my black beauty. Gas mileage could be a little bit better but that’s my fault.
12, 3 months ago,5,"I have my second ford Flex, I love it. It has nice space besides the 3rd row leg room. It's a smooth ride and nice features. I love all the sunroofs and buying used is more affordable. I LOVE MY FORD FLEX
"
13,3 months ago,5,"Had my ford fiesta for 4 years. Absolutely love it very reliable, easy to maintain. Starts first time every time and easy manual to read and follow when things need changing"
14, 3 months ago,5,I rented this car to go out of town and loved driving it! It was a smooth ride and great on gas! It was a great car to take on road trips! I definitely will consider buying this line of car. I do recommend it to all who travel a lot!
15, 3 months ago,5,"
I am a 100% Ford gal. I owned a Ford Focus ZX5 for 15 years and I had to finally pack her in. I really miss that car.
I purchased another Ford Focus 3 years ago and I still love my Ford Focus, I love the way it handles and the gas mileage is great.
I will always stand by my Ford!!
"
16, 4 months ago,3,"A decent vehicle that has offered dependability for several years now. Definitely spacious and comfortable ride. The “upgrades” just seem to wear out faster than I’d prefer. Sunroof controls, backup camera, buttons that control temp and radio."
17,4 months ago,1,"Current owner of 2 Ford vehicles. I have a 2019 Ford F150 and a 2016 Ford Edge.  Both vehicles have ran awesome for the last several years we have had them.  We have loved them since the day we got them. 

Well, 1 Day after Powertrain warranty expires on the Edge, the check engine light comes on.  Odd, but we figure we better get it checked out ASAP. Take it into the shop the following day as that is when they could get us in.  Codes P0303 and P0316 pop up for a cylinder 3 misfire. Turns out vehicle needs a TSB 19-2346 performed. For those of you that don't know, that is a whole Long block replacement(Needs a new motor because cylinder 3 burning up coolant) I am frustrated to say the least that ford will not take ownership of the issue, even though they have came out with a full service bulletin for this issue. Keep in mind the vehicle has a perfect service record and only 45,000 miles on it which is well below average. So now I am sitting here with a broke down car that Ford wants me to pay $6,200 to put a new motor in.  This issue has got me thinking about switching completely to another brand because their customer service on this event has been horrible and no understanding from them. Just them telling me I am out of luck.  "
18,5 months ago,5,"I bought my 2019 Ford Fusion brand new back in 2019. I've never been a Ford fan and quite honestly I've always talked crap about ford's but I love this car. I love all the options, the size of the navigation screen etc. I just wish on the SE model that I got it would have had fog lights already installed and that they didn't change the style of them because I think the way they are on this model are ugly. I think Ford made a mistake discontinuing this model."
19, 5 months ago,5,"I own the 2013 ford focus se hatchback. This car has been like a mini station wasgon for me. I get about 29.2 miles per gallon with it. While mine is flew fuel I have not had a chance to use that feature.
I have the leather interior which I love. Ford uses a thick nice leatger that allows a wipe ip the mess and go"
20, 5 months ago,5,"Love my Ford explorer. I also love how easy Ford makes it for me and my family everytime theres a recall or potential problem they send me something to let me know, always very prompt."
21, 5 months ago,5,A great SUV option! I rented one for a few months and absolutely loved it! It’s roomy enough to comfortably fit five but small enough to be easy on gas. The Escape has some fantastic features and feels like I’m riding on a cloud. Love!
22, 6 months ago,5,"So to be honest I didn't like Ford's growing up. But fast forward almost 15 years and having been through a lot of other brands we decided to give Ford's a try. I got an Explorer and my husband got a Mustang.
2021 Explorer- Amazing. Comfortable to drive and comfortable as a passenger. Plenty of room 8n the second row ""Captain's"" seats for my sons Car Seat and long legs. Love the safety features. The only thing I wish it had is a garage door opener (which I thought was standard but apparently not) Overall an amazing safe vehicle!
2021 Mustang GT- Not my husband's dream car but pretty close. He got the 6 speed manual transmission. V8. And he loves it! And for a sports car that too has quite a few safety features that you wouldn't expect."
23, 6 months ago,5,"I bought a used 2007 version off Facebook Marketplace and I love it! Gets good gas mileage, easy to keep maintained."
24, 7 months ago,3,"This make of car has nothing but problems. If not for the warrantee I purchased I would have spent over 100,000 in repairs. I do not recommend this product. It’s overpriced and limited in options."
25, 7 months ago,4,"My family have owned several vehicles from Ford Motor Company.  My 6-speed 2017 Mustang GT was my favorite, but had a major engine issue shortly after driving brand new off the lot that required a complete engine rebuild.  Luckily Ford’s customer service was amazing and the car had no other issues since.  It drove amazing and I always received compliments on the design.  I will always be a Ford customer!"
26, 7 months ago,5,Every Ford I have had has been the upmost amazing vehicle compared to others. They thrive on reliable and comfort.
27, 7 months ago,5,Had a 2012 ford Escape... I'm not a Ford girl but I can honestly say this car was the only car out of many that didn't give me any BIG issues very small issues and cost friendly fixes on mine. Had the limited so loved the crome touches the color changing lights inside the ford's is a big hit with the kids. I did test drive the newer Ford before I bought my last suv and I can say it's nice...I mean any new car is nice to drive but it just didn't have it for me. I dont like the new body style it's not my vibe as ALL.
28, 7 months ago,5,Love the sportiness of this car. Drives amazing nice and soft ride. Handling is awesome and even my older model is great on gas. Comfy to ride in the front or rear....but the best seat of course is the drivers. Has many options and a great media screen..back up camera is great..
29, 8 months ago,4,Very nice vehicle and love being higher up off the ground then in a car. For my families needs though it’s just not quite big enough for us. Overall it is spacious for its size and gets great gas mileage.
30, 8 months ago,5,I love my Ford Explorer XLT. I've had it for about 7 months her name is Lucy and it's nice to be able to go to a place like this and enjoy the quite. Then I got this fresh mountain spring water. Its great for your face!!!!
31, 8 months ago,5,I own a 2018 f150 with 50k miles. No issues at all with the truck. It pulls great and gets good gas mileage.
32, 8 months ago,3,Standard newer car. Pain and a half to work on.. replacing the battery is to damn hard. Great mileage..had to take back to dealer for recall work 2ce
33, 8 months ago,5,"Esta camioneta es comodidad al 1000%, asientos super cómodos para que hagas tus viajes con toda la comodidad posible, es amplia por dentro, tiene un sistema muy actualizado para manejar, asientos de buena calidad, para mi es una de las mejores camionetas, la recomiendo al 100%  Ford Escape"
34, 8 months ago,5,"My first SUV and I love it so much, it has a great stereo system and navigation as well which is so nice. It has comfy seats and lots of room in the back plus the rear seats fold down for extra room when needed!"
35, 8 months ago,5,"Ford - we have had our Ford Fiesta since 2015. Brilliant car, service and after sales were good. Can’t fault the car and never had any problems."
36, 8 months ago,4,"I had a car like this about 13 years ago, it is very comfortable and uses very little gas, I like it but for me, it was small."
37, 8 months ago,5,"We have a 2015 Ford Fiesta, build quality is good a few niggles but generally a good car."
38, 8 months ago,5,"I loved my Ford Focus. I had it for 5 years and it was the best car I could have asked for at the time. From trips up and down the east coast, to every day travel to work, this car could handle it all."
39, 9 months ago,4,My mother owned this type of car and had it for many years until she recently purchased a new car.
40, 9 months ago,5,"I love Ford! I’ve owned other brand vehicles but they just don’t compare to Ford quality! The only thing I’d improve is the price, they can be expensive but are definitely worth it in the long ru n. I highly recommend checking them out! Ford is the best! Ford Motor Company"
41, 9 months ago,4,"I was thoroughly surprised by the utility of this vehicle and the space inside. We primarily use this vehicle as a commuter car and to travel in the city. We ALWAYS get a parking space. 

We have also used it for day trips for 2 people. The gas mileage is great!"
42,9 months ago,5,"I owned a Ford Focus for 5 years and it was one of the best cars I have ever had.  Mine was a standard and I never once had any problems with it, the only thing I ever had to do was oil changes!  Had exceptional gas mileage and was fun to drive."
43, 9 months ago,5,"Ford mustang voiture qui arrache le sol, sensation conduite avec beaucoup d’adrenaline"
44, 9 months ago,5,Ford owner for life! We are a Ford family (with exception of my husband’s RAM). Currently have 2 Mustang GT’s and an Edge ST. Love the performance and features. So many vehicles these days look like they have a tablet glued to the dashboard and I love that the touch screens in all of our vehicles are integrated in the dash. Between the 2 of us we have owned 6 other Ford’s previously. We have never had any mechanical issues whatsoever (aside from airbag recalls that were quickly resolved with a trip to the dealer).
45, 9 months ago,4,"fina terminacion, moderno, compacto, de buen gusto, urbano y familiar, tiene todo lo que un aficionado puede pedir"
46,9 months ago,5,"We have a Ford Escape right now and I love it! Possibly more than any of our more luxurious vehicles we have owned. It is so sturdy, trusty, comfortable, and drives so smoothly. I want to own an Escape forever."
47, 9 months ago,3,"Not too big of a fan. It seemed great at first, but the cargo space leaves a lot to be desired and there's not a lot of space to scoot the front seats back without making the rear passengers highly uncomfortable."
48,9 months ago,5,This was my college car. Oh did I love her! For being a budget car it certainly drove as smoothly as many of the nicer cars I’ve driven. I had zero problems with the car throughout ten years of ownership. I mean zero! Nothing broke.
49,9 months ago,3,Drives good and great on gas. It has a lot of leg room in the back and a medium size truck. Great starter vehicle for someone just starting to drive.
50,9 months ago,4,"I really like my 2015 Ford Fusion. It drives smooth and it is a solid car. It gets 25 mpg in town and about 30-35 mpg on the highway/interstate. The only issue I will mention is that there have been numerous recalls on my vehicle since I got it 2 years ago. These recalls are fixed for free, it is just concerning."
51, 9 months ago,5,"Nice, compact, smooth ride, has a sunroof, power everything, it's cute and has Bluetooth and voice activated dash and remote start comfortable but it is small 😉"
52,9 months ago,5,I love my Ford Escape. I’ve had 2 so far and would definitely buy another one. Affordable and big enough for my family.
53, 9 months ago,5,Best car ever! Always dependable and never let me down. Never rusted and the paint never looked dull. I had leather seats and took very good care of them with leather whiles so they always looked brand new!
54, 9 months ago,2,"I had a 2013 Ford Focus brand new and it was nothing but problems from the moment I left the lot. Eventually, I ended up in a car accident and my air bags never even went off... sooo therefore I would not recommend nor do I think I’ll ever buy a Ford again."
55,9 months ago,4,Overall the car is very nice and they drive very well. I personally think it is not very spacious and 3 full grown adult definitely DO NOT fit in the back seat. The trunk on the other hand is surprisingly a very good size.
56, 9 months ago,5,Family friendly! Absolutely love the Ford fusion!! Great gas mileage.  Easy to maintain.  Very easy to maneuver. Highly recommended!!
57, 9 months ago,2,Hated this car. It was too tiny and thought I’d get better gas mileage than I did. I couldn’t wait to get rid of this car.  If I was a kid in highschool it would probably be good. But it’s a Ford and with all fords ive had in the past this one also had transmission issues
58, 9 months ago,4,Very nice and comfortable car. The truck space is awesome and the ride is very smooth
59, 9 months ago,1,"Would not recommend this car to anyone! I had so many issues and constant recalls it was insane. Thankfully all covered under warranty, but it was an inconvenience none the less. It also have a manual engine with an automatic system so you aren’t in charge of shifting so it jumps around on stops and acceleration."
60, 9 months ago,5,Definitely a great car! They are reliable for sure. Only downside is they don’t have great gas mileage but you’ll get that with bigger cars. My moms has lasted her a very long time. I would consider buying one
61, 9 months ago,5,I love my new Ford Escape! I have the panoramic view roof which is really nice on summer night driving in the countryside. The features are great with keyless entry and my vehicle came with an automatic starter. It definitely helps when the temperature is -34 where I live. 
62, 9 months ago,4,"Very smooth ride, very clean great on gas on its so roomie in the front and in the back. Look great in all colors and personalized to fit your attitude and needs. Can be used for travel and local very safe car."
63,9 months ago,4,"Every newer Ford I've driven seems to have a delay between the pedal and the engine. Otherwise was a reliable car, I never had any problems with mine. A pretty heavy car so it was good in the rain. It had plenty of room on the inside.  Overall a good experience."
64,9 months ago,5,"Absolutely love my car! First newer car I have ever owned. Great gas mileage, heated seats, Bluetooth, keyless, heat & air is phenomenal, super spacious front and back seats."
65, 9 months ago,4,"They are ok, I drive them at work I’ve bought those two for my son. It’s a great car."
66, 9 months ago,3,It’s an okay family car. Was not my first choice. Have many issues with car dealership that have turned me off of all Ford cars. Is a good reliable for us at the moment. Roomy. Will keep until I can afford another.
67, 9 months ago,5,"Out of all the vehicles ive owned my expedition is my favorite. Its roomie, good gas mileage and just fun to drive."
68, 9 months ago,5,"I love my Escape! It is comfortable, drives well and has some great perks like heated seats, climate control and other features that some higher end brands have but at an affordable price."
69, 9 months ago,5,"Love the Fusion. Bought it like new, and picked it over the Escape due to the comfort and lumbar support. Love that the wheel base is that of an Explorer, which makes the ride much more smooth."
70, 9 months ago,5,"I absolutely love my escape! This is my third one and I have never been disappointed! Dependable, smooth ride, looks nice, and priced well. Highly recommend!"
71, 9 months ago,5,"La verdad nunca e conducido una de estas camionetas, pero si me gustaría, mi tío tenía una igual a está y dice que es súper cómoda para andar dentro y fuera de la ciudad además si aguanta algo de peso y el modelo es muy lindo 😍 sin duda a mi sí me gusta esta marca de autos"
72, 9 months ago,1,I honestly don’t recommend a Ford Fiesta. I’ve had problems since I got it. It’s just a cheap car to get you from point a to point b.
73, 9 months ago,5,I just purchased my Ford Fusion recently and so far I am loving it. I had a Honda Accord in the past and I loved that too but the Fusion is definitely a nice car with nice features.
74, 9 months ago,5,I have been driving a escape for two years now it’s a great car I have had no problems there was a recall on the locks but the dealership fixed it all up
75, 9 months ago,4,"maravillada hermoso coche listo para usar con quien uno se siente  a gusto, fina terminacion, completa, diseñada para la inquietante ciudad, aun no he recibido espero contar con uno para probar, "
76, 9 months ago,2,"I drive a 2008 Ford fusion. The vehicle is ok. Has had a lot of issues with the interior. The inner door handles broke after a year I first bought the car. Part of the dash board also broke a year after I bought. I have also had many other issues with the struts, and engine. I have always taken care of all my vehicles but this one has for some reason given me the most problem. I do not believe I will be buying a ford again. Have had better luck with my Chevy cavalier which is older than my for fusion."
77, 9 months ago,4,"My car is going on 16 years old now. First car I ever drove! The leather interior has held up great throughout the years. Never had any major issues or repairs. Relatively inexpensive to maintain. Not a huge fan of the CVT but also never had any transmission problems. Overall, I love my 500 SEL"
78, 9 months ago,5,The Ford scape is a nice SUV.  I like them so much.  Very comfortable and spacious.  Great for a family of 4 or 5.
79, 9 months ago,4,Such an awesome family car! I love the drive so smooth. Really good on gas. Which the trunk was a little bit bigger. But overall amazing
80, 9 months ago,5,Beautiful car. It runs great and I haven’t had any issues to date. It’s a 2017 and runs just like the day I got her. Sad that they don’t hold their value at all but it’s a safe car and gets me where I need to go. Oh and the trunk space is great!
81, 9 months ago,3,Not the best inside features.  Okay on gas.  Not a dream car by any means but a good family car.
82, 9 months ago,4,"What originally drew me to this car was it’s very unique and powerful design. The front hood appearance is a great combination of both masculine and feminine energy which I personally like to interpret as #LADYBOSS energy💖🤩🙏🌼 lol. &They had a beautiful shade of dark red which is hard to find in other models. I love this car because it is the first I ever purchased directly off the lot on my own! Yet would I recommend? I would probably not recommend to others on the basis of the large number of recalls I’ve had to take my car into the Ford shop for maintenance for, (it is free) yet slightly inconvenient for those with busy schedules! So far I have had I believe 3 or 4 direct recall notices for my Ford Fusion which makes this model semi problematic for others I would think. I love this car for me, but for others? I would definitely say pass on it and consider a model with less recalls. (:"
83, 9 months ago,4,Para autos para salidas cómodas en parchesitos de amigos es cómodo puede tener capacidad de moverse rapido y tambien es cómodo hay que valorarlo
84, 9 months ago,5,I love Ford's cars trucks and SUVs they might be a little more pricey than the competition but we'll worth it.
85, 9 months ago,5,"Enamorada de este carro, desde el chasis hasta el interior, Woow es práctico a la hora de manejar, te da buenas millas por galón de gasolina, perfecto para viajes largos .."
86, 9 months ago,1,"Because  I  can't  give 0  stars ..  pile  of  shhh..   if  they  would  fix  the  transmission  issue..  I  drove  it  and  had  to  stop  on  the  highway  and  let  the  transmission  cool down!  There  is  "" no fix ""  3  transmissions later ...  the  fuel  mileage  is not bad  other  then  that  STAY  AWAY  don't  waste  your  money ."
87, 9 months ago,3,It was  an  ok  drive.  Not  for  me I found  it  sat  low to the ground  and  dash  was too  big and  I couldn't see  the  hood  too  many blind spots.   Had  lots  of  power  though.  It was  comfortable  to  drive  just  not  something  I  would  purschae
88, 9 months ago,3,The car was great for functionality and purpose. It was nice on the interior and held up well. I liked the Ford connect in the car.
89, 9 months ago,5,I love it! I have had it for about 2 years now and it’s been a very reliable vehicle with minimal issues. I haven’t had many issues at all
90, 9 months ago,3,I think that the car is a really good car! I had the 2011 but I recommend! It can be super cute
91, 9 months ago,5,Love my little car. So enjoy the screen in the console (definite upgrade on my previous car) and so handy that the maps are on the screen. Runs really well. Only issue I’ve had is with the Ecoboost (engine stops when the car stops eg. traffic lights and restarts to take off) that the battery does wear quicker than in a car without the Ecoboost. I’d happily buy another one.
92, 9 months ago,5,The titanium is the way to go!  Such a smooth ride. This car has all the bells and whistles.
93, 9 months ago,5,"I have always driven Ford vehicles and the Fusion is one of the best cars I've even owned. It's feels sporty, but also a family vehicle. Great on gas and the price was good for the value. I would buy another Fusion."
94, 9 months ago,5,"Me encanta ford, 
El estilo, y todo su interior es hermoso.  Además amo el desbloqueo de puertas por clave de Ford ñ. Cuando se te quedan las llaves adentro es perfecto 🤡!!"
95, 9 months ago,3,Good quality car with great gas mileage. Sometime has trouble in the MN winter but still manages to get us around
96, 9 months ago,4,Great car we have the 2019 version with the Ford pass access. It is so nice to have the ability to start the car with our phones and all wheel drive is a must for MN winters
97, 9 months ago,3,My partner had problems with his brand new Ford which was disappointing. Pros are that it's a good looking car but cons for that a lot of the stuff on the inside of the car quit working. It was very expensive so to get a new vehicle that didn't work very good then had problems right off I get to go was disappointing.
98, 9 months ago,4,Another used vehicle I had. It kept me on the road and easy on gas. Not much room in the vehicle though.....
99, 9 months ago,4,"I drove the Ford Focus wagon SE for a while. It was not the most luxurious vehicle but it was reliable, and as they say “built Ford tough”."
100, 9 months ago,4,I own Mercedes but this car had a lot of bells and whistles. What I like about it is the auto dim headlights. I am always turning my brights on and off and with on coming traffic it can be a challenge so the auto feature rocks.  Other than than I don't have much experience with this car other than as a rental.
101, 9 months ago,5,I like it and I love it it’s the reliable the space is big it’s good for a family good for traveling but it’s a bit expensive￼
102, 9 months ago,4,It is good beautiful reliable but it is small for a big family and that’s the only issue I didn’t want to have it ￼
103, 9 months ago,4,"I’ve had my 2019 Ford Escape for a little over two years. For the most part, it’s been a great vehicle. There’s been a few small issues with it (the tailgate is wonky and they can’t seem to get it fitted right). It’s the perfect size for me (I’m 5’2” and petite) but my 6’ tall husband also fits comfortably in it as well. We took it on a 3000 mile road trip not long after buying it and the three of us all fit comfortably along with our luggage."
104, 9 months ago,5,Good car and versatile in different types of weather. Would love to see more space in back although it is clear it is a compact suv. Also had a random battery issue which was covered. Would buy again.
105, 9 months ago,4,"It is a decent car, and has lots of high tech features (I have the 2014 model). It looks just like all of the other mid-size SUVs, which is probably what I would change if I could."
106,9 months ago,4,I love this car! It get great gas mileage and is very spacious. The radio works really good in it but I have had to replace it once before which was kind of a bummer. Over all it’s a great car especially as a starter car.
107, 9 months ago,4,"Smooth ride, great gas mileage. I’ve put on 20,000 miles in a couple years and other than filling the oils I’ve had no major issues with this car."
108, 9 months ago,5,"I love my car, it is spacious, safe, auto, for me they are very important factors since I live in a city that has snow and being stuck because of snow is a nightmare."
109, 9 months ago,5,Had this as a rental and is one of my favorite to rent would love to own my own gas friendly and a snooze drive.
110, 9 months ago,5,This is one of the best cars I have ever owned. During snowstorms it is especially useful to cover icy terrain. It’s also great because it fits a lot of items if you need to move￼
111, 9 months ago,5,Love my ford. It’s got a lot of room for our family and is still sporty. Great dependable vehicle. Ford Fusion
112, 9 months ago,4,"*/Good smaller SUV with plenty of room and can haul quite a bit of cargo.    Pros it has a great turning radius and lots of safety,  con  not really good gas mileage"
113, 9 months ago,5,I love my 2008 ford escape it's been dependable.  Hard on gas but I love it get me to where I'm going donuts all good
114, 9 months ago,5,"I love my Focus RS as a car enthusiast it’s fun, easy to modify and very comfortable. It’s got some real power if you’re a petrol head like me. I adore this car, but as a Ford fan I’m biased. I love it so much"
115, 9 months ago,5,Amazing little run around car. For a small car they are very spacious. Cheap to run and nice and small to park.
116, 10 months ago,4,I like the car but I can not tell you very a lot of them because I am a girl ...it looks very okay
117, 10 months ago,5,We love this truck we have all the bell and whistles. Back up camera is phenomenal quality best we have ever seen. The seat did rip on us so we will have to fix that. But has almost 200k miles on it and no troubles at all engine wise.
118, 10 months ago,3,"I do like my car as it gets mw from one place to another. However, i think they have way too many recalls or something goes wrong with them. The amount of miles that the car usually lasts for before needing a new one is the one thing i would change. I personally would not recommend."
119, 10 months ago,5,"very fun to drive, plenty of room for 4, great on gas , handles well, great audio, no road noise, very comfortable, has a lot of power for a 4 cylinder."
120,10 months ago,3,I had this car as a rental for a road trip.  I wasn't impressed with the interior along with the engine power.  I think they could have done a better job on it.
121, 10 months ago,5,Great price. No problems with this car when I had one. Love maintenance. Smooth riding. Very sporty look.
122, 10 months ago,4,I live in the northeast where snow and ice are unavoidable for 5 months a year. The escape handles it like it’s nothing. Goes through it with ease. Even through 28” of snow.
123, 10 months ago,5,"I drove my friends for focus a couple of years ago. It was a smooth riding car. It had a lot of room in the driver seat. I loved the interior, it is very slick looking. If I buy another car I just might buy a ford focus. I'm thinking a black newer focus would be best."
124, 10 months ago,5,"It is comfortable, easy to drive, good size, It can easy to park anywhere because it not so big and it makes me feel youth. I love my car. I do not have cons"
125, 10 months ago,5,I own a 2018. I love it. Great on gas and has all of the technology I would ever need. Its basic size so any decorations can be any brand. I have decals and magnets on it and it hasn't gotten any damage from them. The tags are cheap and so is insurance. The only downside is that it has a very small trunk.
126,10 months ago,4,"I grew up around ford's as my father's side all has them, you can tow heavy equipment and trailers as well as fit 6 people comfortably. The bed of the truck is the place to be as a kid, getting to ride in the back was the best. I really love the new look of the new models"
127, 10 months ago,4,I use to not care for fords but have to say they are made to last. They can definitely take a beating. Last ford I had looked horrible and probably should not have even ran. I sure if it would have been any other competitors it wouldn't have.
128, 10 months ago,3,"I test drove one of these and there were a lot of features that were cool, but not necessary. You could tell Ford was trying to upsell itself big time. Not saying they were bad features or I didn’t like them, I just found better more useful features elsewhere"
129, 10 months ago,5,"Great stocky small SUV for short women. Drivable on snow road, easy to control, and love the all-black color."
130, 10 months ago,5,Love love love love love love this car great dashboard easy on gas great speakers love the car really nice car 
131,10 months ago,4,My Ford Escape is an older model from 2007. She is an old girl but still gets me to where I need to go! Ford is an awesome vehicle and built tough!
132, 10 months ago,5,"Ford power all the way,  love all Fords pretty dam though and hard to beat . And they so look good with the mustang , broncos yessssss get r done"
133, 10 months ago,5,"I owned a new 2011 Ford Escape (old school body style) and had it for 10 years. I put on over 200,000 miles and barely had to fix anything on it the entire time. I loved it, it just got too small for my needs. I would definitely recommend getting one."
134, 10 months ago,5,I love my Escape. Its lasted forever and its a great car. It rides so smooth.  Ford Escape It holds centennial value to me. It was my uncles and I got it after he passed.
135, 10 months ago,2,"Very compact car, cute and would be ideal for just your A to B drives.  Manual transmission is great but the automatic transmission has a class-action lawsuit due to a double-clutch system burning out transmissions.  Not reliable, do not recommend."
136, 10 months ago,2,"Meant to be a practical and affordable little car, but sadly the automatic transmission comes with a huge fault after the year 2012.  It has a double-clutch system, which most high-end sports cars have, yet unfortunately, the market for a Focus is not of high-end drivers.  Essentially, it is designed to press on the accelerator heavy during first initial forward motion, but when feathered on the gas pedal that causes the double-clutch system to essentially ride out and burn out.  Look into legalities in regards to this vehicle, there is a national lawsuit due to transmission failure. "
137, 10 months ago,5,"Absolutely underrated sedan, based off of the same interior as the Lincoln sedan and handles beautifully.  The hybrid versions are ridiculously impressive and with government rebates on plug in models, the Fusion EV is beyond affordable.  Highly recommend."
138, 10 months ago,3,"Practical little SUV, super easy to maneuver and handle.  Easily fits in small spaces such as parking garages and lots.  Improvement needed with the engine idling and interior components is cheap.  Overall, with safety and gas mileage ratings, in real life gas mileage, the Escape is as bad on fuel as the Ford trucks.  The luxury trim, Titanium, should be offered with a bigger discount."
139, 10 months ago,1,"Just don't like the feel, the handling or really anything else about it. Heard the tires on the road the whole time, just all around did not like!"
140,10 months ago,5,"Sensational An excellent car, meets all my needs, gives no problems, and I am totally satisfied with the brand. The company provides full coverage to its customers, and I was very well attended at the time of purchase, I certainly indicated and will continue to indicate  that mark."
141,10 months ago,5,"An excellent car, meets all my needs, gives no problems, and I am totally satisfied with the brand. The company provides full coverage to its customers, and I was very well attended at the time of purchase, I certainly indicated and will continue to indicate  that mark."
142, 10 months ago,3,I would like the company more if they regulated their service departments at their dealerships. They had our truck for over 2 months for their mistakes. 
143, 10 months ago,5,"Love my escape! 4 wheel drive, turbo, and gps - everything I need. There are also a lot of power/charging outlets throughout the cabin."
144, 10 months ago,5,"Great car, amazing on gas, superb default sound system. I drive this daily on a short commute and weekly to the next town each weekend."
145, 10 months ago,5,"Great vehicle for anyone. Drives very smooth, has great features, big trunk. Nice looking car too!"
146,10 months ago,3,"Pas mal mais en vrai je préfère Renault c’est moins cher et ça va aussi vite mais ça y était pas dans les propositions, mais franchement les model mustangs sont ultra belle et si j’avais l’argent je m’e prendrais une"
147, 10 months ago,5,"Ah, memories.  My mom owned a tiny 2-door hatchback with one of those paint splashes across the side.  I eventually took over payments on it and after I paid it off it made the rounds through the family and eventually back to me.  It was a 1995 model and finally had to retire it in 2011 when the underside started to rust out due to many Ohio winters.  Still ran great"
148,10 months ago,5,"I LOVE my Ford F150!! I don't think I will ever buy any other brand truck again in my life. Cold start? Not a problem for my baby girl. Low gas? My baby girl let's me know way before I have to hit the gas station. I have the leather interior, and it is so comfortable! Its silky smooth, too. Just like when I first got it! It's jet black with silver flake, and looks insanely gorgeous especially on a sunny day. I refuse to park outside over night, my baby deserves the best! Lol. Yeah, I'm a chick btw, a hot one too xo"
149, 10 months ago,5,"Es una suv muy práctica, cómoda y ahorrativo, si tienes una familia grande no es para ti, es un carro cómodo pero a la vez pequeño, si son pocos en tu familia seguro te funcionará, anda super bien ahorra gasolina es fuerte al momento de correrla, me gusta"
150, 10 months ago,5,"Sus carros siempre me han salido muy buenos, el que actualmente tenemos es super cómodo, amplio y familiar, nos permite viajar cómodamente y podemos ir todos en un mismo carro. Esto es algo fantástico"
151, 10 months ago,4,"Mines a 2009, it’s really a hit n miss for me, some days I absolutely love my car and others I can’t stand it! Mine has no power windows or locks so that really sucks. But the real issues these cars tend to have is the loud obnoxious vibrating, which you can only hear/feel when inside the vehicle. Other than that it gets great gas mileage and has been through a lot of casino trip miles and hast disappointed yet"
152, 10 months ago,3,I love my Escape.  I have an older version.  Was very disappointed when they changed the design.
153, 10 months ago,4,I really just loved the new style and shapes they gave to the Ford sedans they drive really smooth and get decent gas mileage
154, 10 months ago,3,"We have these as a state car, the base model, and the center command center is not intuitive to navigate. The seats are also not the most comfortable"
155, 10 months ago,5,The Ford focus is a great car. I've rented this car many times and it's always a reliable brand. Very clean and fuel efficient. Definitely 5 stars
156, 10 months ago,3,"This car is smooth to ride in, and have used it on several long road trips. The ride is smooth in the city and highway. We have had several issues with the car that has needed to see a car dealer, so it’s been expensive to maintain."
157, 10 months ago,4,My partner has owned a Ford F-350 for the past 7 years and loves it. The vehicle is still in great condition. 
158, 10 months ago,4,I think this car is actually a lot better than it Gets credit for at first I didn’t think this was a really good car because it was in the cheap brand of the cars or I just didn’t know much about it but honestly it rides great gets great gas mileage and it’s a great economy car
159, 10 months ago,4,Nice car very good gas mileage and it kept up nicely with minimal maintenance. It don't have problems at all
160, 10 months ago,3,I borrowed my brother in laws disel Ford truck to move some stuff from my home. I drove it to my sons house to take him so stuff and before I got back home I got the truck I limp mode and had to get my brother law to come get it out. I couldn't figure it out

164, 10 months ago,5,Does Fusion is a reliable and dependable vehicle. The one I drive belongs to a friend and is well worth the money.
165, 10 months ago,5,We have this car and enjoy it. A nice hybrid of small car to larger car style. I like how there’s lots of space in it.
166, 10 months ago,4,"I like this type of car, I drove a car like this a couple times and feels good is comfortable and feels safe."
167, 10 months ago,4,"I enjoy the Ford Focus 2017 Hybrid. Great gas mileage and nice features but still affordable. It handled in the road well and the best part, it's super quiet. I enjoy seeing how many miles per gallon I can get based on the train and driving habits. Definitely a great car for the price."
168, 10 months ago,4,"i still drive my 2010 ford fusion, it’s held up really well, especially considering i’ve banged the heck out of it over the years. it gets pretty good gas milage especially considering how old it is. i think its about time for a new car but for now i think my fusion still has some years left in it."
169, 10 months ago,5,We used this as a rental and it was a nice ride. Felt very safe in it and it was pretty spacious. It wouldn't suit our family as we have a great dane but it would make a great family car for someone else!
170, 10 months ago,5,"The Escape has been a great daily driver for me. It handles well, is pretty fuel efficient and has been very reliable. It drives extremely well in the ice and snow."
171, 10 months ago,5,"Ford boy for life! Highly recommended, great drive ability, comfort and being able to get to those tough to reach areas up in Northern America."
172,10 months ago,3,Not for a big family. This is small SUV great for older people. Very easy to get in and out. Enough storage for a nice trip. And great on gas.
173, 10 months ago,4,This was the second car that I owned. It got me through with minimal issues. It is perfect for a young person as their first car
174, 10 months ago,4,"It sits really low. Almost feels like a racecar. It’s really reliable! The features in the car are nice, and I’m sure are nicer as the years progress!"
175, 10 months ago,5,"A good car with good gas mileage. It is easy to maintain as well. I haven’t had problems with Ford Fusion except I had to get the airbags replaced, but that was free of charge. I didn’t like going to the dealership though, the employees there just want to sell to you not help you out after the fact. Maybe I should go to ‘Helpful Honda’ LOL. But the car is 5 stars, dealership deserves 3. I would recommend this car!"
176, 10 months ago,4,"Bought a 2011 Ford Focus over a year ago and haven't had any issues. A reliable car that works well. Also, surprisingly cheap to maintain here in Australia which is a stark difference to my old VW. Petrol mileage is also really good and for an older car, has very modern conveniences. "
177, 10 months ago,5,Love this car. Hoping to get one for myself this spring.  Handles wells and is a quiet ride.
178, 10 months ago,4,My car is a 2007 but its a great little ride! It has its quirks with sensors which make it a pain to pass inspection each year.

184, 10 months ago,5,Da hab ich fast den Vater einer meiner Freunde von Früher umgefahren. Damals war ich 12 oder so. Die Kupplung ist ein wenig stürmisch bei den Fahrzeugen bis Bj. 2000. Aber ansonsten sind Fiesta sehr gute City Cruiser mit Potenzial.  Meine Meinung.. Probefahrt!
185, 10 months ago,5,"Is a good car, ahorra mucha gasolina, bonita tapicería y me gusta su estética externa, es un automóvil familiar y bonito.. I would buy it again"

189, 10 months ago,4,Just had this as a rental for a weekend and it felt nice to drive! I was impressed with all the features.
190, 10 months ago,3,"I had a short lived experience with this car. It had all the things, and loved my limited edition! I unfortunately hit black ice on the freeway and end up in a ditch. But the car itself I will say is very well built and safe, not a scratch after we flipped about 6 times downhill."
191, 10 months ago,4,Trucks are good. Spacious. Room under seats. Room in center lots of drink holders up front. The radio work with yoir phone and there is an app to inlock and things.
192, 10 months ago,4,Great driver. The new one could have better heaters...less on the butt more on the back. I also wish they kept the cd player option and the lid on the dash space. The car charger is actually not useful to me because i jave a popsocket .
193, 10 months ago,1,I will never never buy from this car company ever again. R Ford Escape was a lemon and they refuse to replaceI will never never ever buy from this company ever again my car was leaking oil constantly and they never new how to fix it.
194, 10 months ago,1,My son has this car it is the worst car we have ever invested in! It’s been brought back to the dealer many times and is still under warranty and they cannot fix it. It’s like a cheap tin can that acts like a little engine that could... WE HATE THIS CAR￼
195, 10 months ago,5,"Great car, amazing gas mileage. Only complaint is the computerized system that thinks that because I'm in a hurry and put the key in backwards that I'm trying to steal my own car and now has to be towed to a dealership to make it run again. I love my little red ford though. "
196,10 months ago,4,"The Ford Escape is a great vehicle. I like the interior and exterior. I drive it on a daily basis. The vehicle is a really good vehicle, which is great for traveling on long or short trips."
197, 10 months ago,4,"I love my little ford fiesta lol her name is blanch and she has a lot of get-up-and-go. the computer system is kinda wonky though and doesn’t always like to connect to bluetooth properly. i like the size of the car, fits in small spaces and makes u turns easily"
198, 10 months ago,4,"Passenger in this one, my friend had an escape until she got hit. She had minor damage to herself which I was so grateful for! The ride was smooth and plenty of room!"
199, 10 months ago,5,Pretty smooth ride. I was a mobile phlebotomist and it was great for gas mileage and comfortable for twelve+ hour shifts. Could fit two car seats and an adult semi comfortably in the back. We drove this car allot!
200, 10 months ago,5,This is the car my sister has and this is a super nice car and smoothly ride and this car fits 5 people
201, 10 months ago,5,The Ford Fiesta is the perfect size for my little family. It has Bluetooth which is a must.
202, 10 months ago,5,"This is the best Ford I’ve owned I have the 2019 hybrid, I had the standard 2016 fusion before and before that had the 2014 fiesta. I think that this card is honestly really great. It has super updated features and offers Samsung play as well as Apple car play. Everything in the car is electronic which is cool as well. I feel overall the car is very comfortable and modern. I haven’t had any issues with it either. Also, because the vehicle is hybrid it’s great on gas!"
203, 10 months ago,1,Ford is just a rough uncomfortable ride in my opinion. I drove this vehicle for 3 weeks. I disliked everything about it except for fuel milege.
204, 10 months ago,1,I have driven and risen in an escape. The seats are uncomfortable and it was loud on the inside. I will never purchase this vehicle.
205, 10 months ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape! I like the size of the car, the feel of the drive, and how it sits. The only trouble I’ve had with mine was a bit of rusting after years of use. If I have the option, I’ll forever drive a Ford Escape."
206,10 months ago,5,I currently have a 2009 ford escape. It's very reliable and I have yet in have any major problems with it. It currently has 185k miles on it and still going strong. It's very easy to drive and seems to be a good sized SUV. I would recommend it for a mom who only has 1 to 2 kids.
207, 10 months ago,4,"I have a 2019 Fusion Hybrid.  I've not had any major issues with the car,  aside from getting used to the dial to change gears.  I like that I save money on gas because it's Hybrid.  The front of the car is kinda ugly though and it turns on my brights automatically if it's too dark."
208, 10 months ago,4,"I love my Ford fusion, The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because sync doesn't work the company is not in service anymore. Its great on gas, comfy and stylish. "
209,10 months ago,5,My car gets me where I need to go with confidence. I feel safe driving it and it is the perfect size for me.
210, 10 months ago,5,I have had this car since High School I believe it is a 2005 and over 10 years old. Knock on wood...I have never had a single problem with it. Fords are so easy to fix and so reliable. I will never stray away from this brand and always drive a Ford. I would recommend to everyone. 
211, 10 months ago,4,"My husband has the focus rs. Has a good interior and decent power but could definitely use a little more. It’s a fun, peppy little car."
212, 10 months ago,2,I have the 2013 model and the amount of recalls this car has had is mind blowing. I’m in the works of getting a new car my horn doesn’t work and one of my dashboard lights is always on even tho I take my car in to get serviced regularly. I wouldn’t recommend this car to anyone honestly.
213, 10 months ago,5,"I actually really enjoyed jetting around town in this small, cute suv. It was fun! And cute, did i mention? Easy ride, midrange interior, dependability and durability you can expect from ford"
214, 10 months ago,5,My friend group are avid fans of the ford focus because it allows for a great trip for both passenger and driver! The seating is very comfortable and in the newer models there are a lot of “hidden” storage spaces which are great!
215, 10 months ago,5,I’m a huge fan of my Ford Escape. It’s reliable and I’ve owned it for 7 years now. They are the perfect midsized vehicle

220, 10 months ago,4,I recently went on a road trip from Long Beach to Austin in this car with no issues. It was roomier than I expected and quite comfortable.
221,10 months ago,5,I got my car in April of 2020 and it’s the best decision I’ve ever made! It’s amazing on gas and very spacious! I’ve driven from Calgary to Valmont BC on one tank of gas! I have a hatchback focus and if you fold the back seats then you have a bed! Take your pet and get your favourite pop and go watch the stars and just take on the fresh air is perfect!
222, 10 months ago,5,"I’ve had my Mustang for 20 years, it was my first car. She’s still going strong. I’ve had to do nothing but basic maintenance, oil changes, brakes, and spark plugs. I will always have at least one Ford in my garage."
223, 10 months ago,5,Very reliable car that not only gets exceptional gas mileage but is very well built and sleek looking!
224, 10 months ago,5,"Honestly it’s like any other car, but I love these cars because they have more seats and the truck is bigger then a regular sized car."
225, 10 months ago,5,This is my first car and I received it 4 years ago and it is still driving perfectly. I’ve had no issues at all. It steering wheel is so easy to grip and the space this car has is amazing! The trunk is huge and holds all my stuff for traveling back and forth from college!
226, 10 months ago,5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE MY CAR. Initially I was wanting  a larger SUV, but price, high monthly payments, and a lower credit score changed my mind. I got financed for my 2018 Ford Escape without even test driving it. It was July 2020 (middle of covid) and I just signed the paperwork. Boy am I glad I did. Its quick, great gas mileage, big enough to travel with my 2 dogs, and stylish. Amazing purchase.❤"
227, 10 months ago,2,I had a Ford focus about 10+ years ago. I had nothing but problems with the steering colum locked up. Had to get a all new steering column not once but twice with in 2 years of each other.  Gas mileage wasnt the greatest.
228, 10 months ago,4,"Very comfortable, great gas milage. No problems but only drove fir 2 weeks it was a rental.  I liked it enough to consider a purchase the future"

230, 10 months ago,1,Ford is junk. Owned a 2012 fiest for 8 years and nothing but problems. Ford could care less about their buyers.
231,10 months ago,3,"Es un carro muy comodo pero con muchos problemas de sensores, aparentemente es solo este modelo, el mio es move. No lo recomiendo, a pesar de que es nuevo me ha generado muchos gastos"
232, 10 months ago,5,It is an okay car I feel secure but not 100% even tho has a nice engine and a good battery
233, 10 months ago,5,It’s an okay car I have a 2010 it works good it also has a Bluetooth which I love it is a nice car to work
234, 10 months ago,4,"My children put the guilt treatment on and convinced￼ me to get a Hybrid￼ car￼.   I love the sporting us of it, but the interior lacks any luxury. It feels very plastic inside. But the gas mileage is awesome"
235, 10 months ago,5,Really enjoyed test driving just not as spacious for knee area. But then again I have had knee surgery so that has been the only downfall. Beside that very good cars.
236, 10 months ago,1,Literally the worst car I’ve ever owned. It was bought brand new and had transmission problems right away. I couldn’t wait to get rid of it
237,10 months ago,1,Not an impressive drive. Its a smaller suv. For the price you can get a full size suv. Not much more room then a car.
238, 10 months ago,4,"It's alright, I'm not a Ford fan but the escape I found to be to small and uncomfortable for me. I believe this one was and 05 Mosel, maybe the newer ones have better leg room."
239, 10 months ago,4,"My son is the proud owner of a focus st which he adores it is bright yellow and draws admiring glances wherever he goes ,handles well only drawback is it guzzles fuel getting around 25 miles a gallon"
240,10 months ago,2,Was not a fan of this car when I test drove it. Very sluggish acceleration with poor handling characteristics. The backup camera was broken and the interior felt cheap
241, 10 months ago,5,I’m on my second escape because I love them so much. I had a 2005 and am currently driving a 2012. The only reason we upgraded to the 2012 was because my grandparents were needing to get rid of it. My brother bought our 2005 because it still has so much life in it. They’re the perfect size as a pre-kid vehicle. They’re kind of small once a car seat is added to the mix.
242, 10 months ago,4,"I love my car. It’s very stylish and sleek. It has a racing steering wheel, fancy wheels. My Ford Fusion has a heated steering wheel, as well as heated seats. The console is central on the dashboard, the heating system is dual, but that doesn’t work perfectly in the cabin. The wood grain finish on the interior feels very luxurious. I would buy this car again."
243, 10 months ago,5,"I have driven Fords for the past 20+ years in some way! I have owned Taurus, Escapes, Edge and F150's. I currently drive an F150 and wouldn't trade it for the world!  I love my truck - it's dependable and comparable to others out there. I would highly recommend!"
244, 10 months ago,5,"I've had the 2019 Ford Escape SE eco boost for about 5 months and it's been an amazing ride. This was also the first car I've purchased as a young adult. It's very spacious and gets great gas mileage. It's equipped with dual ac and dual heated seats. It was very affordable at the time (under $20,000). If there was any cons I have about the product, it would be the sensitive brakes. But I think that will ease with time. Highly recommend for first time purchasers."
245, 10 months ago,5,"Great Family Car! This car is well made with safety in mind. It has plenty of room. It gets good gas mileage, it has good navigation, it is very comfortable, has great handling, it looks great and it is an affordable car! Ford Fusion is backed by the #Ford brand and is a reliable vehicle!"
246, 10 months ago,5,Excellent quality with enough style for the driver and enough room for the family. Great on trips because the trunk is huge. Mileage for the V6 is about 25mpg highway. Good size engine that can handle all types of conditions. Only issue I have had is in the low profile Goodyear tires. Constantly needing air or popping open when hitting potholes. Wish Ford would redesign low tire light to tell the driver which tire is low. This car is definitely a keeper for years
247, 10 months ago,3,Loved my escape till it had a dead battery one morning then it was the alternator then it was the plugs and so forth well needless to say hubby fixed our escape 2009 now running great but also now his car since I've been upgraded
248, 10 months ago,4,My mother in law owned this vehicle and I loved how smooth it drove and there was plenty room for my 3 kids and trunk room was huge
249, 10 months ago,5,"Dived this Focus while travelling in Europe. Have to say: here, Portugal, Spain and Italy it’s more probably find a Toyota, Ford or Suzuki instead of an Italian. Specially if travel with family, cause the main FIAT cars available at car rental are PANDA or 500. As 4 people travelling, we used once a Toyota, once a Citroen and twice a Ford. Ford was the one that gave me more feel of safety and control. Mirrors are plenty wide and allow you to control each section of the car, cruise control take notes of speed limits and has a good line control. It prevents accidents and has a easy/safe stop in case of red or pedestrian. Can be a good substitute for FIAT, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and BMW. But the line are made for city, not for sports model."
250, 10 months ago,4,I had a 2006 Ford Mustang convertible in white. I absolutely loved driving with the top down letting the wind blow the my hair. It had white leather interior and aux port to connect to my phone. The down fall was the weather stripping was not all there when I purchased it and it would leak when it would rain hard or going through car washes. Other than that I loved it and thought it was the best car.
251, 10 months ago,5,"This is a great sedan, very comfortable seating. Rides smoothly and comfortably. It's an affordable car but feels like a luxury car. It is quite long though compared to other sedans."
252, 10 months ago,5,The Ford Focus was the first cat I ever owned. It was the perfect car for 17 year old me because it was incredibly cute and held up against my rough driving. My parents helped me pick it out because it was safe also. I loved that cat and I got my money's worth.
253, 10 months ago,4,"We love@our little car! It gets great gas mileage and has had absolutely no issues in the two years we have had it. It is a little compact for our kiddos car seat in the back but that is the only negative. Other than that, we love it!"
254, 10 months ago,4,It was my moms car and I was always a passenger in it but I always enjoy the ride seem like a nice car
255,10 months ago,3,I'd rate it better if my motor hadn't blown the other day. Other than that it was a great car. Had a lot of room in the trunk and wasn't horrible on gas.
256,10 months ago,5,"Ford focus has great gas mileage, smooth riding, roomy inside, enough space. Affordable, easy to maintain and very reliable I can depend on this car to get me where I need to go. Would also for sure pick this car 1st if given the choice . I would definitely recommend this car to anyone thinking of purchasing a car."
257,10 months ago,5,"Car ran smoothly, awesome space in back, very roomy, had no issues when driving it. Great mileage per gallon gas as well definitely worth my rental and its affordable. Would for sure consider buying this same car for myself and my family. "
258, 10 months ago,4,I hear so much about ford cars but this is great for beginners too. A gas saver and rides smooth
259, 10 months ago,4,This was a great car when I used it as a rental in Georgia. I felt like I was in a reliable vehicle and the functionality was superb. I don't think I would purchase this vehicle for my own but driving it temporarily was more than enjoyable. 
260, 10 months ago,3,"I was unable to pick the Ford Edge. And it is showing Ford Motor Company- as for the motor company itself. I had a very bad experience shopping for my vehicle. The one they sold my prior to the edge failed me, and they were not very helpful in getting me into something better. Finally I ended up getting the ford edge which I LOVED but then something major happened with the system and costed me quite a bit to fix and Ford was not willing to help me with the costs. I did get it fixed and my ford edge has been pretty good to me. I would get another one. Not at the price I paid though. "
261, 10 months ago,3,"The car runs great, but I’m definitely a person who like a car that’s higher up so I’m not a big fan of the height of it"
262, 10 months ago,4,I would recommend this car to others based off its dependability. Great on gas. If you have more than one child the fiesta and focus are too small for a family of 4 with two small children in car seats
263, 10 months ago,4,"This is my heavy lifting vehicle when doing sporty, messy or outdoor activities that I wouldn’t want in my luxury vehicle like fishing, lugging wood or carrying crawfish. This is a very reliable and comfortable vehicle. It’s compact to fit in parking spaces of all sizes comfortably. I didn’t give five stars because it doesn’t pick up speed very well, but it does have a nice turning radius"
264, 10 months ago,4,I own a Ford and I haven’t had any major issues since  I purchased it brand new in 2015. It’s good on gas takes about 22 bucks to fill it up !  I would like more space
265, 10 months ago,4,It's was a a cool comfortable ride. It didn't hold value and ended up having costly repairs. They are a cheaply made car and hold no resale value. They have ball joint andsteering problems. And don't last very long. I would not recommend. It has to many issues for me.
266,10 months ago,4,The Ford Fusion is a nice car for the price. It has great options for those who can't afford a luxury car but still like features.
267, 10 months ago,5,"seriously love my ford focus 😍 it drives great & is amazing on gas ! nothing about my car i hate, i love it!! nothing needs to be improved it’s perfect! it’s pretty affordable & would definitely recommend!"
268, 10 months ago,5,"This car is amazing, is super comfortable and very stylish, is easy to drive, is smart and safe and is really good to save gas which is good for your wallet too. I think the price is good for what you get, I definitely recommend this car!"
269, 10 months ago,5,Great on gas drove to South Carolina  from indiana as rental and was more roomy that you would expect on such a compact car with a lot of cool features
270, 10 months ago,5,"We love our Escape such a reliable vehicle. We’ve never had any trouble with this car.  Over 100,000 miles on it but is still good."
271, 10 months ago,4,"I rented an escape for a 9 hour road trip and really enjoyed it. There was only myself and my dog, but we were very comfortable and had a lot of things with us. For a larger vehicle, I think the gas mileage was good and I felt very safe. I’m used to driving a coupe so it was a nice change."
272, 10 months ago,2,"I have a 2014 Ford Escape and it seems I get a recall notice once a month. Many of the most important components are made with plastic and did not last very many years. The gas mileage is decent for a small SUV. It's AWD, but ""intelligent"" so I can't control when I go in and out of it."
273,10 months ago,4,Hermoso carro y gracias a dios lo tenga y  bendiciones 😍 para todos muchos besos y abrazos para todos los hombres y son tan tiernos y Mujeres de está página que la bendiga dios para siempre 🙏 y muchas gracias por todo 😇🙏 y chido ☺️😊☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
274, 10 months ago,4,Great vehicle but more road noise than you would expect. Also the shift points between 1st and 2nd need to be closer together. No need to hit 4000 rpm in 1st gear for daily driving.
275, 10 months ago,3,"I don’t really know how to rate a Ford Focus. I’ve only been a passenger in one once. It’s small...way too small for me personally. However, I think if you’re looking for a compact vehicle with great MPG this vehicle would be great."
276, 10 months ago,5,"I absolutely love my car. It’s roomy, comfortable, gets great gas mileage and has been mechanically sound. It drives very smoothly, quick acceleration and I also love the ease of the technology within the vehicle. Having the Ford My Key capabilities is great to have when I let my nieces or nephews borrow the car. It allows me to set a safe maximum speed limit, a radio volume limit along with many other things. Ford Fusion"
277,10 months ago,1,I have a 2012 Ford Focus and it has been nothing but trouble. My husband and I took it overseas when he got stationed there and it had transmission problems galore. They had to replace the whole transmission and right now it’s hanging on by a thread. Not worth the hassle of trying to get things fixed over and over.
278, 10 months ago,3,The Ford Escapes are a decent car. It reminds me of the Rav 4 from Toyota with its body style and amount of space. I'm a Toyota girl through and through though.
279, 10 months ago,5,Look I've had this car for 5 years!! She was born in 01 and her name is Sheila and she's got 401200 miles on her she burns oil like its her day job....and my kids have destroyed the inside but she reliable  and hasn't quit on me yet most of her problems now are just from old age and a lot of wear obviously🙄 but I still drive her till this day! she's got alot of life left in her too and pretty good on gas. the back seat folds down for extra storage space for hauling bigger stuff . I've fit a washer and dryer in the back at once and still packed stuff in there im fixing to retire her tho but I'm going to get a new version of the escape 😊
280,10 months ago,5,"Loved my Mustang GT 5.0 while I had it. It was fast, sleek, beautiful inside and out. It came with a lot of options. I was struck by an semi-truck vehicle while driving on the interstate and it had amazing control allowing for me to get myself to safety with little injury. I'd say it held up to that far better than I could have hoped and only a few stitches for the worse. Will definitely buy again."
281, 10 months ago,5,Au top! Je vous la conseille à 10000% pour les intéressés vraiment woow pour allez ou vous voulez c’est  vraiment très pratique !
282, 10 months ago,4,"It’s amazing car I love it I have there before 3 years , Good in terms of fuel economy and light for me"
283, 10 months ago,4,Cute small affordable car. Something I would purchase as a starter car. Basic features but overall comfortable and functional design. Nice option if you want to try out the Ford brand for your new car.
284,10 months ago,5,Love it! Love it!  It was great. Great to travel in comfortable  svae alot of gas. I would travel  in in on again
285, 10 months ago,5,They are ok I’m not a fan of a ford. My expedition I had gave me nothing but promblems.
286, 10 months ago,5,Rides nicely. Not a Ford fan but if i was I would probably get this car as it’s nice in size and drives very smoothly and it’s comfy
287,10 months ago,4,"Its alright, goes from a to b thats for sure. Wish I would have gotten the newer model. But the 2015 has all the newer things you would need in a car. I would have maybe looked into having the seat tuck into something so it can be fully loaded but things will just have to sit on top."
288, 10 months ago,5,"This is for a 2015 Mustang ecoboost but this app doesn’t have a Mustang listed. I adored this car! From the luxe interior to the turbo whine it was an amazing car! I had just about every option on it. I wish I could’ve bought it when my lease was up, but the dealership didn’t want to work with me. I still miss this car!!"
289, 10 months ago,4,"The 2020 Ford Fusion Energi Hybrid is a plug in.  It goes approximately 15 mi. before it needs to use any gasoline. Very smooth and silent ride on battery.  The seats are roomy in the front and back.  One of the biggest reasons I wanted  this car is for the comfort of the seats. They have great lumbar support which is adjustable.  Also the seats in front have adjustable heat and ventilation, which is wonderful!  Not sure if that is standard or not.  Steering wheel can also be heated.  Only complaint would be with the navigation, not always accurate."
290, 10 months ago,5,So I absolutely love my car. I have had it for 2.5 years and still love it but the sync on it messes up a lot to where it won't connect to my phone and that will last a few days then it will start magically working again. Other then that I love it. I get good gas mileage.
291, 10 months ago,3,I wasn’t the biggest fan of this car. It is a fairly comfortable ride as a passenger but it doesn’t have many creature comforts. I also don’t personally like the appearance of this car. I would say however it would be a great family car.
292, 10 months ago,4,"I have had my 2015 Ford Escape for almost 6 years and it has been one of my favorite cars. It is the perfect size for our family of three, with plenty of room in the backseat and the trunk. I was also able to get a panoramic sunroof in the model I have, and that has made all the difference in feeling like it is a great size. The only major complaint I have is that the 4WD is ""intuitive"" so there is no way for me to turn it on/ensure it stays on. "
293, 10 months ago,5,I love this car. My only issue has been the transmission issues but since the recall and the replacement it hasent been an issue I’ve had this  car since 2014 and it’s still goin. Take care of your car and it will last you a long time. This car has over 300000 miles and still going strong. Keeps going and I love it
294, 10 months ago,3,It was an ok car a little to small for me. But it drove good. And gas mileage wasnt bad. It JUST wasnt a chevy
295, 10 months ago,5,"I have always been a fan of Fords, they have been around forever which speaks for itself and have always been very dependable to me.  The fusion is a really nice car, its larger on the inside and has a smooth ride.  If you are looking for a car over a SUV this may be a good option - again, they are dependable and look great too"
296, 10 months ago,5,"I love my 2011 Grey XLT Ford Escape! It includes air conditioning, cruise control, a four-speaker stereo system with an auxiliary audio input jack, and Ford's MyKey system, which allows you to set speed and volume limits for secondary drivers. It includes a leather-wrapped steering wheel with secondary audio controls, satellite radio, a six-speaker stereo system, a moon roof, and a dual-zone automatic climate control.  
My XLT sits five people comfortably and has cloth upholstery and a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat. Its rear cargo space has a liftgate with a flip-up glass.   
The 2011 Escape has a smooth ride and handles beautifully. It has a 240-horsepower V6 engine. Unless you plan on towing, the engine gets the job done in most situations. The Towing Capacity of my Escape can tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped.   
With front-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic transmissions, my Ford Escape returns 21 mpg in the city and 27 mpg on the highway gas mileage. The four-wheel-drive loses 1 mpg in both the city and highway driving.   
If your wanting a nice used SUV, this is the vehicle to get. I’ve had it since 2018 and have had no problems with it. "
297, 10 months ago,5,Patty (that’s what I named her) is the tried and true! 2 years without any problems at all. Come from a Ford family and will always drive a Ford! CarPlay is my favourite feature.
298, 10 months ago,3,"Love my car but I constantly get those recall notices and they scare me! However, it has good mileage and it’s a great traveling car!"
299, 10 months ago,5,I have the 2013 ford edge for about 5 years and i love it. It drives soo smooth and the alot to leg space. It comes with a big sunroof and lots of trunk space. The pickup on the suv is amazing. I basically never need to put it on sports for pickup. Iove it.
300, 10 months ago,4,This car gets us from point a to point b without any issues. It fits all of our equipment perfectly. Seats fold down which gives room to move larger items. The gas mileage on this Ford focus is great we can drive two hours away and back on a tank and a half.
301, 10 months ago,4,"I’ve driven my 2010 Focus pretty much every day for the past 3.5 years and rarely have I had any issues with it. It gets fairly good gas mileage, and as long as you keep up on maintenance, it’s a great car!"
302, 10 months ago,5,"This was a great car! Mine was a few years old, but I felt extremely safe in it and could fit tons of stuff — friends, gear, etc."
303, 10 months ago,5,I’ve been driving my 2009 Ford Escape for 5 years now and she is a really reliable car. I would make it more rust proof though for sure and I bought mine used for 7000 so they are actually quite affordable make sure you get 4x4
304, 10 months ago,5,My parents use to have a black ford focus with RED INTERIOR! It was so nice and clean! It was a smaller car but it was so nice!
305, 10 months ago,5,"This is my moms car and i drive it sometimes. I love this car, really comfortable and i can’t wait till i get my licence so i can get my own!"
306, 10 months ago,5,"It's a great little car. I have a manual transmission and it has been fun. It gets better than average gas mileage, and doesn't cost a lot of money to fill the tank."
307,10 months ago,5,Responsible good first car not too expensive ￼and good for every day tasks not too expensive to run
308, 10 months ago,4,"Tuve un ford fiesta 2004 sin cajuela y era bastante buen carro, era bastante amplio para ser el carro más chico en ford en ese momento, y un carro con bastante buena movilidad lo tuve en calor negro, bastante bonito, sin problemas con la carrocería y/o el motor"
309, 10 months ago,3,"Los autos que salieron antes del 2010 salieron defectuosos siempre se descompongan de algo del motor, siempre tenías que llevarlo al taller, y no eran muy bonitos estéticamente a comparación de los años recientes donde son amplios espaciosos muy silenciosos no les suena nada de la carrocería"
310, 10 months ago,5,My mother in law has this car and I LOVE IT! I could see myself getting one in the future!! It's great on gas and it's so beautiful 😍
311, 10 months ago,4,"Ford has come a long way. The focus was cute, eco-friendly and handled well. There was quite a bit of road noise, but the speaker system helped mask that well!"
312, 10 months ago,5,"We have had a full sized Ford Van for 23 years and it is still a very reliable vehicle!   The cargo capacity is great.  We have loaned it out to numerous people when they needed it.  Ford makes good, reliable products that can stand the test of time."
313, 10 months ago,5,Good basic car and easy to drive. Comfortable to be a passenger in. Good car to maintain with little going wrong. have had a few of these cars in the past and were good cars
314, 10 months ago,3,"It’s an ok car, I can’t complain... get my family from point A to point B safely.  Economical on gas and maintenance"
315, 10 months ago,5,Very nice car drives smoothly seats are comfortable and I love the way the driver seat sits you can see the road with ease and comfort.
316, 10 months ago,4,"The car itself is nice and reliable. It has all the amenities. Tech screen, back up camera, heated seats, etc. It hasn’t had any serious mechanical issues."
317,10 months ago,5,This has been my second car after switching from an elantra. The switch from sedan to a small suv has been great. The car drives perfect and is very gas affordable. The car fills up rather quickly with less money than other cars. I would recommend this car because it's very gas friendly.
318, 10 months ago,4,Had a fiesta years ago. Nice wee car. Good for city driving. Not great as a family car.
319, 10 months ago,3,Not very fond of ford. Most of them have a drive train that feels lose to me. Their flywheels almost always seem to give out and the train bands give way to early.
320, 10 months ago,4,Me encanta la carroceria y mas que nada que es muy seguro es moderno ya que tiene Bluetooth y es un poco caro pero vale la pena
321, 10 months ago,5,"i love my ford focus, its really nice not much wrong with it ever, latest thing i needed fixed was my thermostat but other than that i havent had a problem, next car im getting is just a newer version of a ford focus becausr i have an 06."
322, 10 months ago,4,"My Ford Flex is very roomy, has all the options including a fridge. It has a twin turbo, so it's quick. The gas mileage is bit very good though"
323, 10 months ago,5,"I absolutely LOVE my escape. I have yet to have anything go wrong with it and I drive it a LOT! And I love the space. I have two kids, so that's very important."
324, 10 months ago,3,"I like the look of these cars, very sleek and cute. But I constantly had problems with mine. If it wasn't one thing wrong it was another."
325, 10 months ago,5,We recently purchased our 3rd Fusion. Our family is a big fan of this vehicle! It’s spacious and has a huge trunk!
326, 10 months ago,3,It's way to expensive....  I wasn't comfortable riding in it .... You can get way more car for alot less!  I guess just not the car for me!
327, 10 months ago,5,Not my favorite but it gets me from a to b. It is good on gas. Rides and handles well. Is a good family car and will sit 5 comfortable. Would sit 4 comfortable for a long trip as there's lots of trunk space for baggage.
328, 10 months ago,5,I drive a 2016 F-150 crew cab and it is my mobile office. There is so much space in the cab that I have plenty of storage and space to work from my laptop. This truck is super dependable and easy to maintain. I will forever buy Ford trucks.
329, 10 months ago,4,Very nice car.  I have only ridden in it so I do not know how well it does with needing repairs.
330,10 months ago,5,its my favourite brand if i will buy the car then i will go with brand and enjoy my drive
331,10 months ago,4,I used the ford Focus when my suv was in the repair shop to be fixed it was a nice suddan but Id rather have a bigger car

337, 10 months ago,5,We got our Ford escape after having our little one. We love how it's not too big but it also works as an SUV.  I wish it wasn't as compact on the inside with more room but other than that this is an amazing and affordable family car that I would recommend to everyone!
338, 10 months ago,4,"I like my little car but I did have recalls for the transmission when I bought it used. It's a 2012 and I believe the issues are in models from 2012 to 2016. If you are looking to buy one check the year and the recalls before you purchase. Ford replaced everything under the recall for free and the dealership was really great to deal with. 

I do love how small it is. Easy to drive and park in smallish spots. Great fuel efficiency. Talking like 30-32 mpg. It's saved me a lot on gas. Other than the recall I haven't had to bring it in for many repairs. It's a small car but I can still fit a ton of stuff in the back seat or in the trunk. 

We took it on a 12 hour road trip and back and wasn't worried at all. I like Ford because of what it stands for and its roots in American manufacturing. I come from a family of 7 and all of proudly drive Ford vehicles."
339, 10 months ago,5,Always have and always will have a soft sport for Ford vehicles. The fusion was my first car purchase and I never regretted it. The seats are so very comfy. The stereo I had was amazing. All in all a great purchase for me. Will def purchase again and again!

347,10 months ago,5,I truely like ford vehicles I do beleive these car factories should always offer fuel base and not electric
348, 10 months ago,5,"I drove the older model of this car for a while, and honestly, it was actually really good. The smoothness of it was comparable to that of my Corvette and it was not expensive at all"
349, 10 months ago,5,I have been driving a Ford Escape since 2011 and I will never drive anything else. With the smaller size I was impressed with how much space the trunk has and how smooth of a ride it is.
350,10 months ago,4,Good car it’s very nice on gas. Push to start. You can connect your phone Bluetooth with the radio. Great looking car.
351, 10 months ago,3,Based on looks this car is great. It looks more expensive than it is. Unfortunately it’s not very comfortable to drive and the interior controls make it lose some of its appeal.
352, 10 months ago,5,I love my escape! My first car and was a brand new at the time. I purchased an SE and a sports package. Couldn’t be happier! Great crossover.
353, 10 months ago,4,My dad had a new Ford Fiesta before he passed away. I drove it several times and it was an excellent little car. It’s small but has lots of room and it’s amazing on gas.

360, 10 months ago,5,My favorite car I’ve ever owned. Mine is a hybrid so it’s amazing on gas. The interior is beautiful and the car drives great. I owned a regular one and then bought a hybrid and I won’t go back
361,10 months ago,5,"I had to drive this while my car was in the shop. I loved everything about it! The backup camera showed where you would go turning the wheel. The dash feature was gorgeous and simple. Just like my car, the size, gas mileage and handling were great. Almost made me want to buy this to have...along with my baby!"
362, 10 months ago,4,Super cute and compact vehicle that gets you from point A to point B. The gas mileage was amazing! It does not have a lot of power to it for driving on the road but it is excellent for driving around town.
363, 10 months ago,5,Always buy a Ford car.most reliable.not only does my dad work for fords but my brother does to and they both will only buy a Ford car.
364, 10 months ago,3,Its very roomy especially in the back comfortable ride. Very nice seats easy to hook IP car seats which was nice. I felt safe and confident while I was in this car. Sou d system was great the only problem I would say is the low lights were not as bright as I think they should be for someone with children riding with her children that's all I would say thanks
365, 10 months ago,5,I live my car! It is a v4 but it is really fast especially when it is on sport mode! I use if for doordash and gas lasts at least 4 days.
366,10 months ago,4,"Me gusta, es cómoda, buena relación calidad precio, tiene muchas funcionalidades y buen rendimiento."
367, 10 months ago,3,This car is really small but easy to get around in and great on gas as well. Trunk has a lot of space too for such a small vehicle
368, 10 months ago,5,"i love my car, it’s a 2009 but it still is very fast and picks up speed very quickly!!"
369, 10 months ago,4,"The backseat is too small for 3 car seats, but we loved everything else about it! Perfect for small family that prefer a smaller SUV."
370, 10 months ago,4,I rented this car form enterprise and loved it I’m not very big on American cars but this was a very pleasant surprise for me very comfortable for me not sure about how someone over six feet would feel it is very compact
371,10 months ago,4,"I have own Ford vehicles in the past. They're good cars but the the engines get a little noisy after awhile. When I ask my mechanic about the engine noise, he said: ""It's a Ford"".  It had something to do with the valves sticking. (I'm not a mechanic) This is what I was told. I went back to a Toyota."
372, 10 months ago,4,El color es lo que más me gusta de este coche aunque es una pasada el acabado que tiene
373, 10 months ago,5,"Absolutely love it. Great on gas mileage. Roomy interior and plenty of space for transporting. Does excellent in the snow, no need to shovel plows right through. Love the all wheel drive and all of the technology included."
374, 10 months ago,5,Muy cómodos para una familia pequeña pero tuve la mala experiencia de que el mío fallaba mucho lo lleve arreglar muchas veces y no funcionaba al 100
375, 10 months ago,5,I love my Ford Escape.   It’s the perfect sized SUV and so comfy.    With all the different models you can get there is a price range for everyone.
376, 10 months ago,4,This is the best car I have ever owned. Great mom car and it works really well in the snow!
377, 10 months ago,5,"I love this car, before I went and bought one,  I went to enterprise and rented a car exactly like this one for a few days for a trip with my boyfriend It was a great car! 
Ford Fusion"
378,10 months ago,4,"It's a safe car in the high cost versions, it's a good vehicle with manual transmission, although it has a tiny problem with its automatic version. It's affordable in his manual transmission version. And the most reccomended it's the high cost one because it has six airbags, abs break system and electric stability control and also Isofix for children retention systems."
379,10 months ago,4,My daughters car and she has had issues with alarms going off for no reason so now what can’t lock her doors
380,10 months ago,3,I’m pretty sure everyone in my family except myself has had a fiesta. Maybe I should invest?
381, 10 months ago,5,Drive it back in forth to work 30 miles away. Great gas mileage and very comfortable
382, 10 months ago,4,My daughter bought a Ford Fiesta as her first car. Great little car for her and have no issues other that a known issue with the clutch...we knew before we bought it and it didn’t stop us.
383, 10 months ago,3,"Pros: Drives smooth and fuel efficient. 
Cons: The exterior is soft, anything plastic in the car breaks easily. They can improve this car by using Better lasting material. Yet it is an affordable car. I would still recommend the car."
384, 10 months ago,4,"Es un gran auto, es amplio por dentro, cómodo, tiene estabilidad, calidad en los materiales aún en la versión más austera, durabilidad, ahorrador de combustible, excelente desempeño en carretera, si bien las refacciones pueden ser un poco caras el costo del auto es bastante bueno en relación a su calidad"
385,10 months ago,3,"Let me be blunt, I own a 2007 Focus SE sedan, not the current model. I purchased this used with under 120,000 in fair not good condition from a dealership clearance lot where they fix up trade-ins fast for quick sale and only a 90 day warranty on engine/transmission. It is a comfortable little car with a small gas tank and decent gas mileage compared to the Chevy Malibu I had. I am saving $10 a week on gas now provided I stick to 1 brand of gasoline though, BP. Ironically, BP is actually the recommended gas brand on the gas cap of my car. This will be the 1st car I have owned that is gas brand specific. I have put other brands in my tank and learned that BP truly is the best for this car in terms of mileage and not have fluctuations in power performance. Negatives is this cars cd player and radio suck. Subpar speakers and static reception on nearby stations because of the antenna design. Also the aux jack is inside of the dashboard where you can't get to it! Why?! And ya'll I researched it and just out of some desperate explored entire front interior for a secret jack before accepting reality that Ford did in fact intentionally purchase some units without front facing aux jacks, but rear aux jacks! And ya, a radio is an important part to a car driving can cause me anxiety quite frequently and radio entertains me. Also cd player is cheap and worked for only a few months before eating and destroying a brand new NOW CD. There is something weird going on with transmission that occasionally slips and car isn't the best with going up high hills. Thermostat repair is expensive because you have to replace thermostat with the assembly that contains the sensor or you just wasted money on a still broken car if mechanic just replaces the thermostat. I got lucky and mechanic took responsibility and put correct part in at no extra cost to me. Headlight bulb is cheap to buy but pricey to replace because accessibility to getting to it is hard! Oh and dashboard buttons and dials are cheaply enabled and break or pop off too easily. Most of my buttons are barely readible and the heater vent cotrol dial pops off as well as the button on my gearshift. So car is somewhat decent if you can purchase it at a cheap price"
386, 10 months ago,5,"I’m a Ford girl foe sure. The Ford Escape is perfect because it’s got the fuel efficiency and price point of a car. However, it’s got the spaciousness and height of a SUV. Plus the car comes equipped with all the features you could want."
387,10 months ago,4,"It’s overall a good car. Speeds up fast, durable, overall a good looking car. I’ve had my 2019 for a little over a year and it’s still in good shape but I have noticed a few things that could be a problem later on in the cars life"
388, 10 months ago,4,I really loved it. A couple of my family have these also but I absolutely hate the shutting off at stoplights.
389, 10 months ago,5,Bought my daughter a fusion for her first car and she loved it. Ford's were so reliable through the years for me.
390, 10 months ago,4,"My parents own a focus, and its their second one. When they were looking for a new car they stuck with what they loved. The dashboard digital screen can be alittle distracting at times I find."
391, 10 months ago,4,Good car and mileage with a long lasting brand that offers diff car colors and models
392, 10 months ago,2,Was grate up untill Transmission went out on it and had to replace neutral safety switch 2x other than that it looked nice ..
393, 10 months ago,5,"Pros: Good on gas!!, spacious in side !!,easy!! to maintain, !!stylish,
Cons:air bag recall
I would tint the windows and put nice rims on to improve this 
Affordable not to expensive"
394, 10 months ago,3,It is a complete suv but its design is not pleasant since it is very small and its competitions in the market
395, 10 months ago,2,I have only been a passenger in the older models of the Ford Escapes and I find them very comfortable especially in long trips.
396, 10 months ago,2,This is my second vehicle I’ve owned while I do enjoy the sleek look and feel of this vehicle it seems to have some slips or transmission issues where the car shakes every now and then I wouldn’t recommend this car to a new driver as it does have many internal issues that I’ve had to have fixed.😬
397, 10 months ago,5,This car rides smoothly. It’s small but bigger than most small cars. I would recommend to anyone looking for a small car with more room than the other small cars can give you.
398,10 months ago,5,Love my Ford Escape . Plenty of room in the trunk and seats for a comfortable ride. Love my heated seats
399, 10 months ago,5,"Es un automóvil muy bonito y con buen funcionamiento, es un excelente auto, tiene colores muy padres para el gusto de todos"
400, 10 months ago,3,Bought it used a year ago. It's been amazing. Its fully loaded. I would purchase a new one if it were still being produced.
401, 10 months ago,4,It’s a real nice car inside very roomy speakers have a crispy sound to them. The ecoboost saves a lot of gas for the power that it also picks up speed quick
402, 10 months ago,5,Ford over is an amazing company. Ford vehicle have been in my family since I can remember beginning with Mustangs which I still own to the now Ford Edge I currently drive daily. They have durable strong engines that last.
403, 10 months ago,4,"I've always driven sports cars. I've had 4 mustangs, 2 Camaros and a rare Chrysler Conquest TSI Turbo. I finally changed it up and a year ago I purchased a 2017 Ford Escape Titanium. It's AWD with turbo and ecoboost. I didn't think I would like the switch but I was wrong. This suv has everything. It is a very comfortable vehicle as well as a good looking one. I love the heated seats and love that there's heat and temperature control for all passengers in the vehicle. It has everything. The Insurance is cheaper than with my past sports cars. This suv on the down side does cost more than a basic suv. Around $39K for my model. Also great in the snow so it's worth feeling safe and being able to travel in any weather safely."
404, 10 months ago,5,I’ve always been a Ford person. Great little car and almost 30 miles to the gallon. Heats well easy to drive
405,10 months ago,3,"I love my car but its not on the list, its a Ford mustang and its green, all cars have pros and cons no? They break we fix them 😆😀"
406, 10 months ago,5,I truly enjoyed this vehicle. I would still have it today if I did not get into an accident that totaled the car. Great gas mileage and very comfortable.
407, 10 months ago,3,Great little car!  Good mileage..sporty...well built and reliable. We get over 30mpg highway.
408, 10 months ago,5,My@parents had a car like this and it was very nice. A good car for a small family of 4. Plenty of room and drives smoothly. Loved the leather seats so nice
409, 10 months ago,5,This was my car before the one now. It’s good for a small family of 4. Plenty of room big trunk and drives so smoothly and doesn’t drink gas.
410, 10 months ago,5,"I love my escape. It has held up great over the years, 100+ k miles and through many different weather conditions."
411,10 months ago,1,I purchased this car new from the dealer and although it is very convenient in gas mileage and small for me and my small kids the recall defects has been very depressing. It has a recurring issue and the warranty will only replace parts to a certain point. I can deal with the mistake that was made and sold but how the brand has chosen to deal with this issue has made me not ever want to purchase ford again after this car wears out.
412, 10 months ago,3,You can feel every bump in the road when you drive. Not at all smooth. Feels light so I don’t feel as grounded. Love the gas mileage and it is has great features. The technology is better than most luxury vehicles.
413, 10 months ago,5,I have a Ford Flex and I'm in love with this car. My favorite car that I had purchased. I love how it rides on the highway. Grandkids love the third row.
414, 10 months ago,4,"I have a 2016 and I absolutely love my car, the only bad thing I can say is that I get a lot of re calls in the Mail but I’ve never had any issues with my car."
415, 10 months ago,5,Gas saver is a plus with this car. I do love going fast so when putting it into sports mode I reach a top speed of 140.
416, 10 months ago,3,I used to have a 2006 and my brother owns a 2012. The older version had a lot of electrical problems but from what I know my brothers runs pretty good still!
417, 10 months ago,5,I enjoyed being a passenger in this wonderful car. I felt safe and comfortable the entire ride. Its a smooth ride and very good with gas
418, 10 months ago,5,"I have a Blue Mustang and drive it a lot in the summer. It is my favorite car that I've ever had. It has a lot of power, I have received so many compliments on the car. I can't even count how many. You can have passengers in the back. It has a decent trunk space. I love it. I will probably keep it forever. "
419, 10 months ago,5,"I've enjoyed my Ford Escape. It is a reliable vehicle. I am a fan of Ford vehicles in general and have had good luck with them. My Escape is reliable and I am able to haul my music equipment in it. I also like to take it on trips. It is very spacious. Yes, I would recommend it to others."
420, 10 months ago,5,Highly highly recommend it’s beautiful inside and outside my god and it’s very safe for kids
421, 10 months ago,3,"Un auto no muy cómodo para viajar, si está bueno para andar poco tiempo todos los días, pero no grandes viajes, ya que sus asientos están mal diseñados y generan náuseas"
422, 10 months ago,4,"really nice car. very nice drive, very smooth. looks amazing in the day and night and is easy to look after. doesn't cost much to fill up a full tank and is worth it for the price in terms of it being a car you keep for the long term, can be passed down."
423, 10 months ago,5,I rented this car a couple of times last year to go on road trips. I really love driving it.
424, 10 months ago,5,I love my escape! Its a gret family car that we also.lobe because it tows our tent trailer! Plenty of room for everyone
425, 10 months ago,3,Good little car. Bought used. Haven't had many issues other that a dead battery. Paint didn't hold up very well. There are several oxidized spots.
426, 10 months ago,5,I drove a Ford Focus for years and loved it! It was just time to get a bit bigger vehicle for my growing family. I would definitely recommend it to someone who prefers a smaller car with good gas mileage.
427, 10 months ago,5,Love the car. It’s small and easy to drive. Have had some recalls on it but they have been fixed by the dealership so I didn’t have to worry about it.
428, 10 months ago,4,"When the tires aren’t out of alignment it drives very nicely and it’s smaller, so it’s easier to navigate"
429, 10 months ago,5,"The best thing about it is the gas... Once a week fill-up is what it's about. It's a ""small"" car, but fits my family of 5 comfortably."
430, 10 months ago,4,"My grandparents own this car and it’s a pretty good car, it has issues often but that just may be  the way my grandparents drive, it’s lasted them at least 5 years now"
431, 10 months ago,5,Great car I have never had a problem with it great on gas love this car! I love the new colors they give you to choose from I have personally owned 3 ford fiesta and would recommend to anyone to buy one!
432,10 months ago,4,Drove a 2019 Mustang. Not my type of car. Too squished inside and not good for having kids. But It drives nice and has power.
433, 10 months ago,5,We love our ford mustang. We have been able to modify and personalize it to fit our unique style and needs. Literally the only thing I dislike is the cupholder placement. It is a financially reasonable price tag to get your need for speed fix. Definitely recommend
434, 10 months ago,5,Mi carro es muy espacioso le caben 5 pasajeros y en la cajuela le caben bastantes cosas y no es muy estorbosa para estacionarse gasta poca gasolina
435, 10 months ago,5,"my mother in law owns a brand new escape and has had several over the years. love the way it drives, love the back up camera, and all the other bells and whistles "
436,10 months ago,4,"Although I got it used, it’s been a very good car to me. Miles Per Gallon has stayed up tremendously. One of the things I would critique is the brakes, they always feel too soft even with them bled, other than that it is a good overall family car."
437, 10 months ago,2,"I have owned 2 of these. I had so many issues with both of them. They get great gas mileage, but that's the only good thing about them. Every other month I had some sort of electrical, engine, or transmission issue with both vehicles."
438, 10 months ago,4,My bf has the 2018 hybrid... Its a fun car. The gear shift is a knob though.... So if you are clumsy you could bump it while driving
439, 10 months ago,3,"Much prefer our luxury SUV. The lower price point may make this seem like a deal, however, the difference in the ride and the interior space (or lack thereof) is VERY evident, in comparison to a higher end vehicle."
440,10 months ago,4,"Lot's of factory warranty recalls, other than that, amazing fuel mileage and a great college car! Lot's of room, all kinds of trunk space, easy to clean. Comes with Bluetooth stereo which always makes safely listening to music super easy! Amazing first college car for any kid!"
441, 10 months ago,5,This has been an excellent driving car for my husband who drives 40 miles one way to work. It has been pretty dependable with minor fixes.
442, 10 months ago,4,Love the escape for a smaller SUV. Drives very smooth. Pros that it gets great gas mileage for a SUV. The cons is that it is a smaller SUV@if you are looking for a bigger vehicle if you have a bigger family.
443, 10 months ago,5,My first car was a Ford Escape.  It by far is my favorite car and I loved this car.  I would still have it if it wasn’t hit while parked.  It did well in the snow and off roading.  I can’t wait to own another when the time is right!
444, 10 months ago,3,"I loved my Ford Escape! It was great to drive, especially in the snow with it being 4WD. Only downfall is the transmission died after 130k miles. And the wheel wells rusted!"
445,10 months ago,5,"I absolutely love my car. I drive a long distance for work, so the gas mileage is very nice. The car is very roomy and spacious. I would definitely buy this car again in the future in a new model. I have recommended this Ford Fusion to all my family and friends."
446, 10 months ago,3,My mom had this car and it was nice until till the transmission blew after having it for only a couple years
447, 10 months ago,5,"I have a Ford Explorer and I LOVE my truck!! 3rd row is super convenient when I have my nieces and nephews, great gas mileage for the type of vehicle it is, and love having 4 wheel for the super bad winter roads!"
448, 10 months ago,4,"It is comfortable and works well!, but not spacious enough. I really gave it to my young son..I feel that this type of car is for young people.."
449, 10 months ago,5,Its one of the best car i have used. Easy and convenient plus fuel efficient. Has all the features which you need in a car. Pickup and mileage is super awsome. I love it. I recommend it to everyone who wanna buy new car
450, 10 months ago,3,Ford Escape is a nice looking ride. I enjoyed everything about it and all it’s features except for the drivers seat. The seat felt too snugged for me. I went to purchase it a few years ago and went with another make not Ford. Perhaps they’ve improved it.
451,10 months ago,2,"Decent car but based on my experience I wouldn’t recommend.  It’s not smooth to drive and most of the people I know have issues with the truck, prior to 5 years.  Parts and maintenance is inexpensive."
452, 10 months ago,3,This just wasn't a great car in my opinion.was something I enjoyed driving but it did get me where I need to you..just was enough room for me being 5ft10
453, 10 months ago,4,It was a great first car for me and my husband to buy. It’s great with gas & it drives smoothly. I would of liked a bit more room as far as back seat. But it has great trunk space tho. So that’s nice
454, 10 months ago,4,Very nice.  Fancy technology.  Tons of options.  Comfortable and roomy.  The back seat folds down to allow more trunk room
455, 10 months ago,4,Compact but big enough.  Nice small suv without the bulk.  Tons of room in the back.  Reasonably priced.
456, 10 months ago,1,"I actually bought a Ford fiesta, I had so much trouble with it that I let it go back. Within a month of owning my Ford fiesta it was in the shop from a blown head gasket and then it was in the shop for over three months, I was given a rental car while my car was in the shop. But I was paying for a car that I wasn’t able to drive it was in the shop for several different issues mostly transmission. I was very disappointed that Ford was not willing to help me get out of a very bad deal. I would be very skeptical if I was given an opportunity to buy another Ford in the future.￼"
457, 10 months ago,5,"So comfortable to drive for a long distance drive, the car is so good to sit in and drive, not to long to heat up in the morning!"
458, 10 months ago,5,Great car. Makes me feel really safe and secure while driving. Mine is black and it looks great!
459, 10 months ago,5,"This is a nice car. I had it as a rental for about 2 weeks. The drive is great, very roomy, and very inovative. I highly recommend Ford. "
460, 10 months ago,2,Don’t like this car. Safe car. Drives well. Not cute. But I mean it’s practical and reliable.
461,10 months ago,1,"I hope they've improved this vehicle since 2009? Its... unreliable at best. It shouldn't be having the electrical issues its having at the age it is. It has some sort of issue when it idles too long as well. Honestly the only reason I didn't give it one star is because at least the darn thing is still running. Please don't buy an older model of this vehicle though, especially from a terrible car dealer (The last bit being 100% our mistake.)"
462, 10 months ago,2,"I did not like my Ford Escape. It felt like I was riding inside of a tin can and there were seemingly always something wrong with my car. I felt relieved as soon as I sold my escape and bought something more reliable. I love Ford, but they missed the Mark on this car.￼"
463, 10 months ago,3,These are very nice! And so spacious! I would buy one but they are pricey and not worth that much
464, 10 months ago,1,should never have trusted ford but i did - once! awful experience with the purchase as well as the vehicle. 2014 ford focus had so many transmission problems that they ignored even when i brought to their attention that i was having issues! finally trade it in for a kia soul in 2017 and THEN they admit a problem
465,10 months ago,5,loved it! one of the best cars we had! great from the inside and outside. big and a lot of space
466, 10 months ago,5,"Para mí es la mejor marca automovilística manejé un ford focus por 6 años ahora llevo 10 con un ford edge y me gusta mucho no me dan problemas más que los de rutina por ahora no pienso cambiar carro,pero en caso de que sea necesario lo cambiaría por otro Ford"
467, 10 months ago,4,"I like my Ford Fiesta . It’s got Bluetooth audio, that’s great to listen to music. You can also manipulate the bass and treble of the music. It’s a pretty smooth ride, it’s moved easily by wind. I wish it drive better in the snow"
468, 10 months ago,5,This is probably my favorite car that I’ve ever had and driven. It’s an SUV but it’s not too big for city driving. It has a touch screen and buttons for easy use while driving. It’s fuel efficient and a safe car
469, 10 months ago,5,The best car ever!!!!! I love every Ford car!!!!!! It is perfect for everyone!!! ST is my favorite!!! I recommend it to all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
470, 10 months ago,5,"I own a 13 fusion. Reliable. Has some get up if I need it. Bluetooth capable, good sound system. Would recommend for anyone looking to not spend a fortune"
471, 10 months ago,3,"Looks really nice from the outside, but I think that the space inside isn't enough. You get really crowded inside. Specially if your tall like me. And you end up hitting your head. I think they tried to make it look sport, and it does look sport on the outside."
472,10 months ago,4,"It’s roomy, stylish, and has lasted me a long time. While I’ve had a good experience with this vehicle (8 years and counting), it has had a few recalls and not the best on gas."
473, 10 months ago,3,It really wasn’t my style. I think it’s great for a person that just wants to get too and from work or school. I will say it is a very good choice for a person that doesn’t want to spend too much on gas.
474, 10 months ago,4,"That’s the car I’d like to have next. Reliable, comfortable driving. Easy availability of car parts if needed. Beautiful and affordable. Seems pretty safe due to its construction."
475, 10 months ago,5,I love my car! It has been great and is great on gas mileage! It is the perfect car for me
476, 10 months ago,3,I bought this vehicle when I was in a bind and though it’s a decent car it isn’t exactly what I wanted. It seems small for an SUV and I really don’t like how the back seats take so much effort to put down. I like the one hand functionality my last vehicle had better.
477, 10 months ago,2,"Large, great mileage, uncomfortable. It’s large outside but instead it’s not as spacious so it doesn’t equate to a good time with kids who bicker when they are too close to one another."
478, 10 months ago,3,"I wasn’t a fan of the Ford Escape. I drive a Chevy equinox, and it’s much more comfortable. The escape seems like it is a little small, and it’s not the best in regards to space and storage compared to other vehicles I’ve been in."
479,10 months ago,3,This is an ok car it does handle quite well and seats are very comfortable it is not the most roomy car but for anyone who doesn't need tons of room its great
480,10 months ago,5,"This was a great car and I purchased it when I was on a very tight budget.  now that I got a raise, I purchase my highlander and I will be passing this vehicle on to my daughter.  I love the fact that I can control the max setting of the car with a key.  it will be a great starter car for my daughter."
481, 10 months ago,5,I'm really impressed with ford I've looked at quite a few vehicles and this vehicle is pretty Cool. Tell me if you like your vehicle??
482, 10 months ago,5,My husband just got this car for himself.  I was very surprised to see how much room the cargo area has. Very powerful car abd comfortable.
483, 10 months ago,5,"I absolutely love my car. It's a 2015 Ford Escape and I never had a problem with it. It's very spacious and comfortable. I love the sunroof and the sound system. The heated seats are also a huge plus for me. I'm almost at 100,000 miles and it still runs like new."
484, 10 months ago,4,Man oh man if you don’t have a Ford Fusion you’re missing out. It’s the most comfortable car. Drives pretty smooth. Haven’t had any trouble out of it other then just one small issue. I have a red 2010 Ford Fusion se and I love it
485, 10 months ago,5,"Great car for the price, just with that the truck space was a little bigger. As the car ages, it’s not as good on gas as it use to be."
486, 10 months ago,4,I love Ford. I’ve been a Ford driver for 16 years! I love how the ride is smooth and the inside is roomy. The price point was ok. I still prefer the Focus for room/ price. If you have need of room this one is for you.
487,10 months ago,5,Love my Ford Focus. I have no complaints. It’s given me zero problems since I’ve owned it. Great little car and great on gas!
488, 10 months ago,4,"I am not a Ford person, but I do like my roommates escape. I like how high it sits up and that it has the eco boost and the engine that shuts off at red lights. I also like the seat heaters. They feel good on my back"
489, 10 months ago,4,"Reliable, every day car. Fits 2 car seats well. Drives smooth. Comfortable. Good size. Electronic system could be better"
490, 10 months ago,1,The transmission was awful. I had to as a work car and they ended up replacing all with a fusion due to so many issues with the transmission. It was also small and didnt fit a lot in it.
491, 10 months ago,4,I like the drivability. My main issue is the fuel door switch is in the door and often has issues connecting.
492, 10 months ago,5,Great mid size family cars. They are wonderful reliable vehicles. Comfortable ride whether it’s a short ride or a long ride.
493, 10 months ago,5,The Escapes are great vehicles. They are very trustworthy and roomy. They are comfortable on long trips and excellent on gas. I just got me a 2015 Ford Escape SE EcoBoost and I absolutely love it.
494, 10 months ago,2,This is my wife’s car and I absolutely hate it. I am 6’ 3” and I BARELY fit . The electronics are wonky in it and always glitching out. There’s a bunch of recalls for it. The transmission is garbage. The antenna broke off on its own. Terrible car. Great gas mileage though
495, 10 months ago,5,"To this day the focus is still my all time favorite car, even though I now drive an suv. This was my first car and I loved everything about it. Drove great and so so spacious! The best part was the giant trunk, was able to hold 3 girls stuff to and from college many a times with room to spare. Living in the snowy north this car never disappointed in the snow; plowed right threw!"
496,10 months ago,5,Makes great cars for good price. I love the classics from the 70s but they have been coming out with come nice ones lately.
497, 10 months ago,5,I love my Ford Fiesta!! Priscilla is a wonderful vehicle!! Yes I am one of those!! She has a lot of get up and go and she always puts a smile on my face when I go for a drive!! Handles well and never have any issues! Very well built car!!
498, 10 months ago,4,Great car. Has its problems here and there like any other car that has a good amount of miles. I call it a boat... it’s definitely a larger sedan. I can fit a lot more in here than in my civic.
499,10 months ago,4,Loved my escape! It was my first car and it was amazing! It was a beast in the snow! I did have an 08 so there was a lot of issues with rusting and the back window notches
500, 10 months ago,5,I absolutely love my 2011 Ford Escape! It has been the best vehicle I have ever had. It can go anywhere and the interior is awesome. Most models come with everything you could ever want plus mine has heated leather seats.
501,10 months ago,4,"Buen carro, responde bien cuando vas a acelerar y frena sin problemas. Tiene calentador en los sillones ideal@para el invierno"
502,10 months ago,4,"Es un buen auto algo compacto, ahorra combustible, el interior es cómodo y el diseño es bueno, ideal para ciudad, su vida útil depende del mantenimiento y cuidado que se le dé, en general es agradable, pero por lo que dura de vida útil no lo compraría."
503,10 months ago,4,"Es una auto cómodo con muchas funciones, me gusta el interior, no gasta demasiado combustible, aunque no es para andar en muchas partes, en general es sólo para tenerlo en la ciudad, el diseño es bonito, ocupa espacio medianamente."
504, 10 months ago,3,Decent vehicle. Tested this vehicle to the limits and it never broke down. At high mileage I had a few expensive repairs. It was very reliable for the first couple years I owned it.
505, 10 months ago,4,Minor electrical issues such as window motors have been my only issue with the car. Other than that I am satisfied with my purchase.
506, 10 months ago,5,I love my car! Since i got it it has not given me any problems. Anything that i get done for it is affordable. Ford is such a reliable brand!
507, 10 months ago,5,"I love the Escape! We owned this car for a lot of years, it’s surprisingly spacious for kids and packing things around (we used for a few different moves). We took our car across the country multiple times, and I love how easy service is and it’s just a great dependable car."
508, 10 months ago,5,"I love that car, its comfort and its aesthetics, I love it and it is very fast, its leather seats very comfortable and without fear of staining"
509, 10 months ago,3,"so far its ok i guess i bought mine off a lady who was the only driver, fords are basically all pick and choose and its just a hit or miss if they mess up or whatnot, had issues before with other versions of fords and ya i would yet wouldn't recommend"
510, 10 months ago,4,I currently have an 2007 Ford Escape. Replacing the spark plugs is ridiculous considering any other car I've owned they've been a couple dollars each but this Ford escape has spark plugs and coils that cost $300 just for the parts
511, 10 months ago,5,I really enjoy this car! It is great in the snow as well. It is only a lease but I love it so much I might purchase it after!
512, 10 months ago,5,Love love love this car. Wish to never go back to any other car but unfortunately starting this year this car will not be made for public use according to online.
513, 10 months ago,4,Nice little compact car and has the speed behind it. You will look great in it whether your driving or.just the passanger.
514, 10 months ago,5,I love my little compact car. It meets all my needs and i enjoy driving it.and i look good in it. Its got the speed behind it...
515, 10 months ago,5,"I drive a 2019 Ford Flex which I love! I did a lot of research before choosing this vehicle. I needed a vehicle that seated at least 6 passengers, had tinted windows and leather seats because I have kiddos, a tow package to pull the Harley behind it during trips and was going to be my keeper until it can't be driven anymore. The Ford Flex met and meets all my expectations! We will continue to use Ford for our vehicle needs!"
516, 10 months ago,3,This car isn’t the best I out there but it definitely can get you place to place when needed.
517,10 months ago,5,"Fusions are nice, smooth vehicles. They sit very low to the ground, and depending which you choose have very little room. I would improve the product by offering a larger cabin or even a little larger tires or higger from the ground. I would recommend this to younger adults."
518, 10 months ago,4,"I have had three Escapes in the last 10 years. Really the only critique I would have is the look of it in the last several years. The look of the outside has become sleeker and sleeker, taking it more away from the rugged SUV look it used to have and more towards looking a bit like a crossover. I miss the more boxy look and am looking forward to seeing and hopefully getting the new Bronco Sport once it’s released!"
519, 10 months ago,2,It’s been a while since last time I had Ford. It’s a nice car for grandparents that’s it. I am not a fan
520, 10 months ago,3,"I've driven this vehicle before  . Its not mine and I would not buy it. I am not a  Ford person. 
Didn't like anything about the vehicle"
521, 10 months ago,5,"This is a great make and model for a small family, it really does have great space inside and Ford is really affordable for what you get and cheap and easy to fix if any issues. I would highly recommend this brand."
522, 10 months ago,5,It's old and nearly 200k miles and still going it has its issues from being old but it is great on gas and still gets me where I need to be. The leather seats are still holding up as well. The insurance is cheap and so was the car so I can not complain. 
523, 10 months ago,2,"My ford had a service notice about the clutch and transmission. This is a known problem with ford focus and fiesta models. Some owners had repairs done multiple times on their transmissions and clutches. I asked ford to warranty it, since they had knowledge of the problem and had a limited warranty. They said no and charged me a diagnostic fee. I called ford canada and initially got a really nice rep who said they would help out. I kept getting calls from another rep who seemed like it was his job to delay everything and after 4 months of back and forth, they finally made a decision to offer me 30% off the labour. This was after I had to call them weekly to see what was going on with the situation. I was out of the country a the time and called them back after a month. At this point, they told me I had waited too long and they would be offering me nothing. I asked what their position was on the class action lawsuit against them and the rep proceeded to get angry with me and tell me they didn't have a position. Anyway, a few months later I got a letter from ford telling me they would warranty my car and the repairs were done. I don't have a lot of confidence that this repair will last and I'm not sure I will ever buy a ford again. "
524, 10 months ago,3,"In particular, I have always loved trucks, although I do not have favorites, I am satisfied that it is large and very good in its mechanical part. In this case I'll tell you about the 2016 Ford Escape, it ranks near the top of the compact SUV class because of its spacious cabin (which I love), car-like handling, and available turbocharged engines. However, the only downside is that their safety scores are below the class average."
525, 10 months ago,5,"I absolutely LOVE this car! It has power, grace and reliability! For a first car for my son I couldn't ask for a better or more enjoyable ride!"
526,10 months ago,4,"Génial pour se balader ou partir en week-end ! Elle est spacieuse, agréable, confortable. Pour l’instant, la voiture n’a pas eu de gros problèmes."
527, 10 months ago,4,Really reliable car. I’ve had my 2016 For Focus for about two years now and have been really happy with it. This car doesn’t have much room in the back at all so I would recommend for anyone with typically has over two people in their car.
528, 10 months ago,4,Absolutely love my ford. Only let me sit twice in the past 6 years. All due to normal wear and tear.            When time for a new vehicle I will be sticking with the Ford family.
529, 10 months ago,5,I really like this car. I drove it as a rental car once and it was very comfortable and well designed.
530, 10 months ago,5,"I currently own a 2014 Ford Focus. I love my car so much. Black leather interior, sport mode, beautiful vehicle. Great price point, and has been the most reliable vehicle I’ve ever driven."
531, 10 months ago,5,"Great service, great car. I recently purchased a 2020 Ford Mustang! It i sporty looking yet practical but still has a pep in its step! No complaints at the moment, I am very happy with my purchase and can’t wait to see how it treats me for many years to come!"
532,10 months ago,5,Very safe vehicle.  My family and I were hit head on by a drunk driver in a newer full size pick up truck. Luckily we were all able to walk away with just bumps and bruises. Would highly recommend this SUV for its safety features.
533, 10 months ago,3,Everyone I know that’s ever owned a focus or drove one have never had good luck. Something major always goes wrong with either the transmission or the fuel lines.
534,10 months ago,3,"It’s compact, smooth ride. I personally would not purchase one but it’s affordable, parts and labor are decent... not a bad vehicle."
535, 10 months ago,4,My husband has a 2018 f150. It's a good truck. It looks nice and handles well and is perfect for our little farm.
536,10 months ago,3,I had to have a car in the shop at one point and this was the car that I had to rent. I took it on a small road trip and it worked so well and I had wonderful gas mileage I highly recommend and would rent this car again.￼
537,10 months ago,5,I absolutely love the Ford escape. That’s the previous car that I had before my GMC terrain and it works really nicely besides it was a front wheel drive car and I need a four-wheel-drive in the Michigan winter so I had to upgrade.
538, 10 months ago,3,I really like this car. The drive is smooth and the tech is very nice. The only thing that I don’t like is how sensitive the brakes are.
539, 10 months ago,5,"Good car,I rental one time this car,good space,economic for long travel,good for parking"
540, 10 months ago,5,"While mine was the older edition, I love this car! Roomy suv, without being too big."
541, a year ago,4,It’s a very nice car just not meant for large family. It has plenty of trunk space and is more roomy on the inside then it looks on the outside but I still would only recommend for small families.
542, a year ago,5,Loved it just traded it in cause it what l do. But id love to have another great for camping
543,a year ago,5,I have owned a few Fords throughout my lifetime and have never been disappointed not only with the vehicles themselves but also with the amazing customer service experience I have had when having to deal with them.
544, a year ago,4,I love my escape. I've had it for several years with minimal issues. It is reliable and a great size for multiple people. It has traveled all over the state with me for my job and still runs like when I got it.
545,a year ago,5,I've had it for almost 5 years and I've only had to do maintenance work on it! I love it. It is on the smaller side so car seats don't always fit but other than that it's perfect for a small person. It was very affordable. Yes I would recommend
546, a year ago,5,"I rented this car on a unexpected trip to Upstate NY and I couldn’t believe how easy to drive this car was. It had Apple play which I found super cool, sits were super comfortable and is pretty good looking."
547, a year ago,3,I would definitely recommend. Smooth drive. Spacious but definitely not a family car. I had to switch to a SUV
548, a year ago,5,Loved my Ford Focus. Excellent gas mileage and easy to drive. Recommend highly. Plenty of room in backseat as well.
549, a year ago,5,"I just recently bought my Ford Explorer and it is one of the best cars out there. It is a very safe, reliable car that I can trust to get me anywhere. It gets great gas mileage and I would very much recommend it. I got my car for a great price and I highly recommend"
550, a year ago,5,"I have a Ford Explorer and I absolutely love it! One of the best, most safest cars. It gets great gas mileage and I have not had any problems with it. I will definitely be getting another one when I need one. I highly recommend this car and they are a great price for the car. "
551, a year ago,5,I thiught this car drives well. I purchased one and unfortunately was hit and they totaled it. But it actually held up in the accident well.
552,a year ago,5,"My car is amazing!! I have just hit 200,000 miles and it is still running beautifully. I couldn’t have asked for a better car!"
553, a year ago,3,The older ones seem to rust in certain areas but the newer ones I haven’t found that problem.
554, a year ago,5,"At first I wasn't sure about it, as it seems so simple. But it was the best decision. My bright blue 2019 Ford Escape is  light, smooth,  stable, efficient and sexy! Best SUV for a women, from a single mom, to a office executive. I recommend it 100%"
555, a year ago,5,The Ford Escape as been an amazing car! We have actually traded in an older model for a nicer model because we loved it so much! I highly recommend
556, a year ago,5,Love my Ford Fusion. I have had several Ford vehicles and the Fusion had been my favorite. I get great gas mileage and other than the normal upkeep I have not had to make any huge repairs. It is my daily driver and our family car for outings. Great price and value.
557, a year ago,4,"The Ford Fiesta hatchback is a cute little car. It isn’t super fast, it does fit me just fine however my boyfriend is 5’11 and has issues fitting in comfortably."
558, a year ago,5,"I currently have a 2020 Ford Focus and it my FORTH one!!  Needless to say I have a bit of an obsession with Escapes and do not see it changing any time soon.  I purchase a new one about every 3 to 5 years depending on the feature's and body style.  The size is perfect and features such as foot motion lift gate, keyless entry, heated seats and BLISS coming standard in most newer models I look forward to seeing what else can be added next!"
559, a year ago,5,Ride Sally ride. I love my Ford Mustang. The way that motor sounds when them horses start running. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ Ford Motor Company
560, a year ago,5,This is a nice little suv crossover that gets great gas mileage!!! It handles well in the rain or snow and the suspension is great. No bouncing all over on a rough road. Over all design aesthetics￼ inside and outside are very comfortable and functional.
561, a year ago,5,I love my car it so economic and easy to use. Whem I bought the car i think these it so hard but now i love my car
562, a year ago,5,It’s a very reliable car! This was my car before I had my third child then I had to upgrade. Now it’s my husband‘s work car. The car is very economically efficient and is a gas saver. we have had the car since 2016 and have had no issues whatsoever. ￼￼￼
563, a year ago,4,"Pour le moment celui que j'ai est d'occasion. Mais ce que je peux dire, ce que c'est une voiture super bien et je le recommande aux personnes qui viennent d'avoir leur permis. Je ne peux pas vous dire, car je l'aie eu en occasion donc rien avoir avec le neuf."
564, a year ago,3,Im not a fan i had this as a rental i dont feel like the ride is smooth and the interior is plain it is a car though so its all in what you like
565, a year ago,5,It’s fun driving a compact car. I appreciate the ease in parking. I don’t feel safe I very small cars.
566, a year ago,5,"Ford Focus was my very first car. My parents gifted me Franny The Ford as my high school graduation gift. Unfortunately, 2 years later, a tree fell on my car and totalled her 😭 .. talk about a freak accident. 

Definitely would recommend."

570,a year ago,5,"I had a hybrid. One of the best cars I ever owned, great on mileage. Easy maintenance."
571, a year ago,5,"A great sedan. Plenty of leg room front and back. Adjustable seat, integrated blind spot mirrors, huge trunk, automatic and sport mode. Only thing I don’t like is the pull button ebrake. I would definitely purchase again."
572,a year ago,2,From the first day I bought this car there was something majorly wrong. It was a new Ford Escape. On my way home the engine light came on and I had problems with it ever since. They tried to put a band aid on the faulty transmission instead of actually fixing the issue. It cost me over 3000$ by the third year to repair it because the warranty had ran out. We now own an F150 which is kind of having the same issue as they only replace the lead frame.
573, a year ago,4,"The ford escape is a good reliable car as long as you don't need awd for snow & ice traction. This car kept me tootin' along for years before I decided I needed something that met my mountain winter needs. I was a delivery driver in the car, I was homeless in this car, very versatile and it got me by just fine."
574, a year ago,5,Nice size car with great features and entertainment package. It was very good on gas and small enough to easily find parks in a busy space-challenged city.
575,a year ago,4,My foot is very economical and guys will get speed mileage really good on gas also very spacey you’re not really into luxury but I really love those cars really good great price of MSRP overalls and
576, a year ago,3,It is so compact and cool for short drive but doesn’t give much comfort for long drive.
577, a year ago,4,"I purchased my 2014 Ford Escape as a used vehicle in 2016, it had 62K. I have put over 60k miles on it and it is still going strong. It is not made for large people, if you are tall I would move up to a larger model. But I am 5'3"" and It works for me. There is plenty of cargo space. It is a very peppy little vehicle!"
578, a year ago,4,Drove great. Zippy for a crossover. Handles well and very comfortable interior. Good enough looking and definitely a great value. Seems to pass the test of time as well. I have never owned one of these though
579, a year ago,4,Nice mid size SUV. Very comfortable for long rides and will hold a lot more cargo than expected. The technology is in line with industry standards. Decent sound system with nice bass. It rides pretty smoothly and I have not had any mechanical issues with any Ford for the first 80k miles.
580, a year ago,5,"I love my little red ford fiesta. Mine has remote start and heated seats which are a huge deal for my Wisconsin writers. I love how tiny it is - easy for brushing off snow, and it gets great gas mileage and can make the tightest turns. Parking, even parallel parking is a breeze."
581, a year ago,5,This vehicle is great on gas. Its is also compact and also big enough to take alot of the family on the adventure.  It has a big trunk area to go shopping and get what you want and haul it . It has a very affordable cost for the great vehicle that it is . It comes in 4 wheel drive too which I really dont ever plan to use.
582, a year ago,5,"Muy buen modelo amplio,es un auto lo bastante acogedor conforme a su modelo exterior e interior,es eléctrico la cajuela es amplia"
583, a year ago,5,"Soporta súper bien el peso,la cajuela super amplia , asientos súper cómodos,eléctrica, rendidora si sonido el lo bastante bueno"
584, a year ago,5,"I used to drive a 2009 Ford Focus. It was the basic model but I really enjoyed driving it. The Focus has great gas milage and is a perfect commuter car, first car, or second car for a family."
585, a year ago,5,I love my ford f-150. Very well made truck and still going for a 2006 model. The only complaint I have is the gas mileage. Everything else is awesome.
586, a year ago,4,You can hear a lot of road sounds also back seat is smaller side. Love that you can put the seats down and has a lot of storage
587, a year ago,4,"I drive this car for some days and I don’t like 👍 is to small the space inside is so tiny, I ting never bye one ho those cars."
588, a year ago,3,"Very small compact car. Not a ton of back seat space, small trunk. Good on gas though."
589, a year ago,2,I drove an older model focus and which they stayed with it. The new models even the upgraded ones feel cheap. I’m not a fan.
590, a year ago,5,"I love my car. It is just the right size for me and has good gas mileage. I love all the features it has as well such as Bluetooth, heated seats, double sun roof, push to start and touch screen radio. I have had no problems out of this car and hope to keep it for many years! I would recommend anyone getting a Ford!"
591, a year ago,5,It’s held up for as long as I can remember through everything. I don’t really like the brightness of the headlights but the radio that it comes with is honestly amazing. It’s not that spacey but it’s not crammed either. Good first car for a child.
592, a year ago,5,I had a focus for 6 years until it was totaled. I never had a single issue with it and I loved it!
593, a year ago,5,I love the space so much! I drive far for work and my car is so comfortable on long drives and the seat warmers are a lifesaver!
594, a year ago,5,This was my very first car and i loved it! It was the perfect size and didn’t take much to fill up the tank!
595, a year ago,3,I never owned but been in one a lot. Pretty good for the price but a lot of recalls I have noticed
596,a year ago,3,"The ford fiesta is a great car. It's very reliable, I very rarely have any issues with it. Great for city driving and motorway driving. Looks really well too. Its a good affordable car."
597, a year ago,5,"Es un modelo muy bonito, compacto, con asientos bastante cómodos, modelo original y lo mejor de todo que es un auto súper seguro."
598, a year ago,5,I was very impressed by it and drive now and then but I do think it has a masculine look to it so I don’t think it fits me but it’s a spacious car. Door handles pockets were disappointing though because I couldn’t place my phone. It’s almost just like a whole.
599, a year ago,5,"Owned a 2000 Ford Mustang Loved this sporty, fast V6 mustang, was good on gas and very reliable, Pros, sporty, fast, gets good gas mileage, Cons Too small. Is easy and affordable to maintain  and I would recommend this year and model Mustang to everyone who needs a daily driver that is reliable and easy to maintain."
600, a year ago,4,Great crossover for adult and one child. Good value for price. There are some features that I believe can be improved on but overall I’m happy with purchase.
601,a year ago,4,"My husband drives a Ford mustang and has owned only mustangs for the last 13 years. They are beautiful cars! Fast & smooth. 

I drove a Ford focus. I had A LOT of trouble with the vehicle until they completely replaced the motor. It shook and stammered and felt generally unsafe, but once it was fixed, that car drive like a dream. It was quiet and head heard seats and windows."
602, a year ago,4,"I like my ford but i feel like its always something wrong with my truck it has all the features i love in a car the space, the look, the smooth drive but its always having an issue with some part of it"
603, a year ago,5,"I love love love my Escape! It drives smooth. Its all wheel drive. So, that's cool. It fits my lifestyle. I don't think I'd ever even consider getting rid of my Escape. Honestly, I'd only get rid of it to trade it for a different Escape! Haha! "
604, a year ago,4,"I have a 2007 ford Edge. While ford is known  for not having  the most solid vehicle, i must say my edge has proven this statement  untrue.  It has held up under all types of road  conditions.  I have truly  only had to do basic  car maintenance. Brakes and oil changes.  Its roomy and has great gas mileage  Ford Motor Company"
605, a year ago,4,Rides great! Car is a little small for me. I like to feel like I’m in a spaceship 😝 my parents have had this car for about 10 years now and still looks great/very little repair work.
606, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Fusion. This is the second one I’ve consecutively leased and im continuously happy with it, except in the snow. The bells and whistles are worth every penny. Drives really well."

610, a year ago,5,I love my fiesta. It is such a good and reliable car without costing too much. They come in a nice variety of colours. I honestly couldn't make my fiesta any better. My one is 2012 so it doesn't have all the fancy new features but it is a titanium which is fab as it has automatic headlights and windscreen wipers. Would highly recommend this car.
611, a year ago,5,I drove a Ford Fusion for a while a few years ago - it was a nice daily driver and handled really nicely.
612, a year ago,5,"Beautiful car, drove well, felt safe and comfortable! This car was not mine, but the vehicle model for my car was not available."
613, a year ago,5,"My mum had a focus for a few years and it was a great car, it lasted us well until the crash"
614, a year ago,1,"This car seems good at first but then it messes up on you before it even is paid off.Cons: Bad in snow, Messes up, ALWAYS HAS A TO BE TAKEN BACK FOR SOME REASON."
615, a year ago,3,"I think this car is too big to be a sedan. I am a very simple person when it comes to what I want in a car and I feel like this vehicle is trying too hard to be fancy, if that makes sense. I wish there was a little less to the car."
616, a year ago,3,"I think this car is fine. A little large for me, but not too big. Great for a family and gets decent gas mileage. I love how much trunk space this car has. However I am not a fan of Fords later in their lifetime."
617, a year ago,5,"This is an amazing company, we have bought our last 6 vehicles through Ford and never had an issue, I like that you can go to any Ford dealer to get service and that  you are getting a great vehicle when you buy a Ford"
618, a year ago,4,"Our focus was nice. Quite low to the ground and with mobility problems that's not helpful. Quite fast for a 1.6 engine and it was an automatic which is ideal, again with mobility problems. The bluetooth system was a little rubbish so 4/5 from me!"
619,a year ago,5,"My mom has this car and it’s super comfortable. I love riding in it, and it also drives really nice."
620, a year ago,2,"It’s a good car if it’s the first one you have, but it has some flaws. Doesn’t run very fast. It is elegant and doesn’t use much gas"
621, a year ago,5,Slick. Sexy. Amazing. What else can one ask for? Especially in an american car! Like come on!!! I would buy one new if I could
622, a year ago,5,"I have been born and raised as a Ford Motor Company woman! My dad is a mechanic and Ford is the only brand he trusted his family in!  Even now as an adult I prefer Ford over any other brand, looks and performance wise! I have a 1986 Mustang convertible and a 2010 Ford Explorer."
623, a year ago,5,Just got my 2017 Ford Fusion 2 months ago and as of now I have nothing to complain about!
624, a year ago,4,This car it’s actually very nice a friends has   It and he enjoys it and it has good space
625, a year ago,1,"I think is not the best brand due to the recalls and failures that comes with this motors. Got an Edge not long ago and right after half the life of a regular motor, this one just broke down. Nice designs but bad motor quality. Ford Motor Company"
626, a year ago,4,It's a ok car but still love my focus and will stick with it until the focus is made again because it's just right for me
627, a year ago,5,I love the ford focus have owned one since 2001 then went to 2011 too bad ford stopped making this car it's really dependable and a great car would not own anything else
628, a year ago,3,"I have nothing against the car itself, but I just prefer suv and larger cars. The car is easy to drive, but small."
629, a year ago,2,"The car is not mine, it belongs to my partner and it has been very defective, the car fails many things, the computer marks things that are not correct"
630, a year ago,5,"I am actually pretty happy having driven this car a couple times as a rental. The Fusion is sporty, has a good kick when you step on the throttle, has a comfortable and stylish interior and gets great gas mileage! If you are looking for a car that sips gas and looks smooth then this is your car!"
631, a year ago,4,"We love our fusion. We have the electric blue. It runs on gas but also had an electric battery. The only thing I will say is the truck isn’t very large because the battery takes up so much space. Overall, it’s been a great car."
632, a year ago,5,"I drove a Ford Focus from when I learned to drive till my junior year in college. It was a great reliable car and an easy drive. It was high quality and as a first car is perfect, I think that reliability is such an important feature for a car and the Ford Focus has it."
633, a year ago,4,I love my car. It’s the perfect size for my family. I do however wish the media screen was bigger!
634, a year ago,2,I hate my car.   I have had constant transmission problems.   Also the recalls on this car has been astronomical.  They need to replace this brand and give customers a new one.
635, a year ago,5,"I had this for a few years and was worried at first that I wouldn’t like it but the gas mileage alone was a steal for me! $10 got me all the way across Kansas without having to stop. I had very minimal problems and the ones I did have were mainly on the tires. Great storage space, drives smooth, and easy to maneuver on the road!"
636, a year ago,4,Loved this car. Was my daily driver and was good on gas. Very spacious trunk. Drove it from wa to ca no problems
637, a year ago,4,"I love my ford focus. I have a 2018 grey FF and I love it. Smooth ride, smooth inside, cloth seats because I still have littles. I also have a 2006 FF that I keep in the garage and will gift to my daughter next year. For quality and longevity, buy ford."
638,a year ago,3,"I had a 2005 Ford focus ZX3. I bought the car brand new and it had problems from the start. Three problems with the transmission and Ford would not lemon the car but they did fix the problem every time. I would have given this car a perfect review if Ford would have stood behind this vehicle better. So this is more a review of Ford's customer service and that aspect. Beyond that the Ford focus has been fairly easy to work on as I am not a mechanic and has been fairly reliable and the fact that it is held up for over 200,000 mi. We are on the third engine for it but that little car still running on its original suspension which Ford is just now saying needs to be replaced. So for the most part great car especially for a young driver."
639, a year ago,5,Love this care brand shape and space it’s very spacious a great family car very spacious trunk for your pups or to carry groceries very smooth driving love all of its features like internal blue tooth
640, a year ago,5,Great American cars that changed the way we live for more than one hundred years.  We use our Fords for business and family life.  Ford Motor Company 
641, a year ago,2,"Honestly I will NEVER again buy a car made by ford or affiliated. Ford is known to use the cheapest materials possible for parts in their vehicles yet they charge the consumer the same as a car company like Toyota that is known for long lasting cars. If you buy a ford, i suggest to get it from a dealership BRAND NEW, Do more than required in terms of upkeep, and definitely pay for Triple A. The cheaply  manufactured parts  will not last half of what they should, and on top of that, you'll probably spend 10 grand easily trying to fix one thing only to then have to fix another directly after. Also... The car will likely be junk by 120k miles."
642, a year ago,4,I liked driving the Ford Escape. They have gotten smaller over the years but they were always a good ride and comfortable. Great option for an affordable SUV that’s quite good on gas.
643, a year ago,4,Comfy for our long (7+ hour) drive to see friends. It was ok on gas in the mountain/hill areas and comfortable.
644, a year ago,5,My husband got this Ford Focus from his mom. We love it. It has plenty of space for all 3 of my boys and they are tall; so plenty of leg room. I would have like that one we had with a sun roof. But love it even with out it. Very affordable and reasonable. I would for definitely recommend this ford to everyone.
645, a year ago,5,I have the white hybrid car. leather seat which warms up . makes it great in the winter. very comfortable and drives smooth. great on gas
646, a year ago,5,I think this is a great car! The for focus is great on gas and honestly has a lot more space in the trunk than I expected out of it. I would definitely suggest others to get a Ford Focus or to look into buying one.
647, a year ago,3,"This vehicle gets you from here to there, but I definitely wouldn't consider it a comfy ride. The pro's are that it is small and relatively affordable. "
648, a year ago,3,Dont buy a ford fiesta unless you want a lot of recalls and problems. Theres a class action  lawsuit against ford because of all the problems with this car 
649, a year ago,5,"Not a bad car. Smooth ride, definitely love my car more. FORDS scare me cause of the old saying ""Found On Roadside Dead"" which is a little intimidating."
650, a year ago,5,Love my Ford Escape!!  I have the Titanium edition so I love all the “bells and whistles”.  The only thing I wish I had that my vehicle lacks is the hybrid version that came out the following year that I got mine.  This has been a great reliable car.
651,a year ago,1,Piece of crap. Paid $5500 for it and found out ABS master cylinder was bad. Cost to repair $5000. And it may have gone put again in 6 mos. Was an OEM part defect and they replace it with same crappy parts. Also coded to VIN. Ford knows it's a problem but they refuse to fix and the refuse to recall. Can cause brakes to fail and kill you. I was a fan of Ford. Never again will I ever buy another piece of crap from them. They lost a lifelong customer. Will instead buy Toyota since they know how to car for customers and will stand behind what they build. Trust me don't buy a Ford or you will regret it.
652, a year ago,3,Boring car to drive if a base model. No get up and go at all . They are a good price point however for a first car
653, a year ago,3,"This truck has so many quirks! The electric locks quit working, the drive mechanism needs to be adjusted so right now i have to start the truck in neutral or it won't start and it's absolutely horrible on ice or in snow! The AC is going out so it needs to be recharged every season. Gets old dealing with the day to day issues of this truck."
654, a year ago,5,I fell in love with this car. Perfect mid size SUV with great mileage. Handles great whether you're in the city or on the road. Definitely a car I would buy for myself.
655, a year ago,5,"This was the first automatic car I ever drove. It is a very safe car. The trunk seems small but it is very big, you can fit a lot of elements. And it’s perfect for traveling and going inside road trips."
656, a year ago,5,Pretty nice cars they look good and they don’t sit super low to the ground. Great to drive and very easy.
657, a year ago,5,Absolutely a great car and super nice. I’d say this is my favorite car and they look so so good! I’d love to own one!
658,a year ago,5,I love my ford escape! Shes a reliable daily driver and great on gas! Comfortable ride and can fit a couple of your favorite friends for a road trip! The new ones are a bit pricey but my old girl gets me where I need to be just fine. Dont need a brand new one but they definitely are pretty if you're looking to buy new
659, a year ago,5,"Buena compra que a hecho mi madre con este carro , es muy bueno y cómodo .✨ Si quiere comprar un carro la Marca Ford es muy buena y económica"
660, a year ago,4,"I have had this car for over 8 years, it is now 15 years old and needs to be retired. However, for the time that I have had it I have enjoyed the comfort of being in this SUV. We have two children so it is perfect size for a family of four and a dog to fit in comfortably while traveling."
661, a year ago,4,I owned a fusion for five years and it was incredible until the fuel line somehow broke and even after fixing it I would have to let me car sit at the gas station for five minutes or it wouldn’t  start.
662, a year ago,3,I think the ford focus is a nice reliable fuel efficient vehicle but I generally drive a truck because my job requires me too.
663, a year ago,3,"my mom had this car for years. It’s a pretty reliable car but after a while, when it’s time is ready, dang everything breaks down at once. pretty sure the darn thing started spitting CD’s at you, the sun roof don’t close, and the leather cracks real bad."
664, a year ago,5,This is such a great vehicle to drive no matter how long you have been driving. It is so comfortable and I am 5’2 so height has nothing to do with it. It feels amazing no matter what seat you are sitting in. It is just such a smooth ride. I love being in it. Now I want a car just like it.
665,a year ago,3,Extremely comfortable and a smooth ride. I’m tall and I didn’t find it to be very spacious.
666, a year ago,4,This car is not the prettiest but it’s very reliable and the interior is nice. It’s cheap on gas and gets me from A to B with zero issues.
667, a year ago,4,I liked it. I am very tall and it was comfortable to ride in. It was smooth and luxurious feeling.
668, a year ago,5,I bought this about 6 months ago and I’m in love. The heated seats and double sun roof are my favorite parts. The trunk opens off my key ring which is amazing and it’s pretty good on gas. Safety ratings are high!
669,a year ago,5,"I have to say my Ford Fusion is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned! Not only do I get compliments on the style of it, it drives beautifully and controls very well. Now its more of an expensive vehicle but you get what you pay for in this car! Great midsize vehicle and fits two people in the back comfortably! "
670, a year ago,4,"I bought this as an upgrade since we were having a baby. The size is decent, but it's still kind of small for my family of 5. We've had to put in a lot of work. But, it drives very well. The only major issue I have is that you need to take the car into a shop for all repairs if you don't have the right equipment because there's a lot of other parts that need to come off too."
671, a year ago,5,Everyone has this car since the dealership orders a lot of it ! It was easy to drive I just don’t like the height of cars so I tend to go towards suvs ! The Bluetooth system works great and it’s easy to use it’s a nice design in the inside ! I just don’t want a car that everyone has.
672, a year ago,5,I live the new Ford Escape ! It’s very comfortable and it drives really smoothly ! The Bluetooth settings are easy to use and set up ! It looks really nice inside and outside ! It’s the perfect size vehicle for a single person with frequent friends and road trips coming in and out of the vehicle ! I love it !
673, a year ago,4,"I've been driving my Fiesta almost daily since I drove it off the lot brand new in 2011, and while I love it overall, I gotta say, the transmission on this model year has some Problems. Twice I've had to have the electronic transmission control module replaced. The first time was a recall and the second time was an extended warranty, but that doesn't really make up for the frustration. Its good on gas and is comfortable though"
674, a year ago,4,Overall I am very pleased with the car. It has good pick up from a stop. The suggestion I would like is not a gap between front and back seat when folded down as dogs fall into the large gap. The passenger seat should be a little more adjustable for a front seat. Overall I do love the car.
675, a year ago,2,My mom has a Ford Fusion and does not love it. I can’t speak of it on my own but she has mentioned it’s not great in the snow.
676, a year ago,5,This car is so comfortable and drives so smooth. I love the technology inside and the gas mileage is amazing￼
677, a year ago,5,Super stylish great car for parents. I love the interior and the room in the backseat. The quality can’t be beat. ￼
678, a year ago,5,This is a great small car. It’s very comfortable. It’s great on gas mileage. It’s a great car if you’re driving a lot.
679, a year ago,5,"My first car I ever purchased on my own was a Ford Fusion. I got into a wreck with a drunk driver and it kept me and my newborn baby safe. Purchased a Kia after my ford was totaled and I hated it. Sold my Kia as soon as I could and I am back in a 2019 Ford Fusion. It has a touchscreen, push to start...just an overall great car!"
680, a year ago,4,"Ah my little red beauty is perfect for me! I don't have children so the compact space isn't an issue for daily use. She's great on gas, fits in all sorts of small spaces, and can turn around in a pinch. The only issue is that there is absolutely no space for an average sized adult human in the back seat of the car. Like I said, this is great for myself and one other passenger, but not great if you have a family!"
681, a year ago,5,My daughter has an escape and loves it. I have an explorer and love it!!! I have always been a Ford girl.
682, a year ago,5,My mom bought this car when my brother and I were just kids. Then when I moved out she gave it to me. It's not the best car but after 25 years the car works just fine.
683,a year ago,5,Excellent vehicle about 7 years ago I had a vehicle of these. I loved it for the comfort and stability of the vehicle. it is practical and safe.
684, a year ago,4,"Cerca de mi residencia existe una planta ensambladora de este modelo, me encantó su diseño y sus colores, su calidad y eficiencia como automóvil. Sin fuda alguna un auto con mucha capacidad y sobre todo calidad, como todo lo qje implica Ford."
685, a year ago,3,Not a big fan as it feels like a big car or too small SUV so just go for the gusto and get an Explorer or Expedition
686, a year ago,4,"I drive a Ford Taurus and have for over 10 years. It's been dependable, reliable with minimum repairs needed, just routine maintenance"
687, a year ago,5,don't even get me started this car is a beautiful masterpiece a being a spirit and mine is named RUBY !!!! this car deserves a good home
688, a year ago,5,I love my SUV. I have the titanium version and the upgrades are perfect for cold winters in Minnesota.  I love how it handles and the great gas mileage for an SUV.
689, a year ago,5,"My last car was a 2011 Ford Fusion hybrid that my teenager daughter has inherited and now drives.  This car has been great to us and with proper upkeep and almost 170,000 miles it still drives great and my daughter loves this car.  I would definitely buy another one because I know it will last me a long time."
690, a year ago,3,"It’s a nice, comfortable car but just not sporty enough for me taste. And, in comparison to other brands, it’s just too expensive for what it offers. So it’s a well enough car but sadly nothing for me! But I think that differs from person to person."
691, a year ago,5,Loved the colors this came in and the sort option package. The accessories are amazing if you like to be connected all the time. Very reliable and great gas mileage.
692, a year ago,4,"I would give this a five star but I do not like the changes they have made in the last 5 years, shrinking the space and making it look like a Subaru. The Escapes I have owned have always been very reliable and have great accessories."
693, a year ago,2,I’m not much of a small car person I prefer bigger ones. This was nice for an a to b situation but not what I wanted. Ha
694, a year ago,5,"Es excelente aún que por dentro el espacio es un poco reducido, la pantalla es genial y como se controla"
695,a year ago,5,"I have made 2 purchases from Ford Motor Company, and love both! I have a Ford Expedition and a F150 off road! Love love love them💞💞 I highly recommend checking out Ford Motor if you haven't already"
696, a year ago,5,I love this car I learned how to drive in this car I learned how to control it easier and wasn’t so big I could see over and it was easy to park
697, a year ago,4,I drove one as a loner car for two weeks while my vehicle was being repaired. I didn’t really have any complaints. It is definitely small but that didn’t bother me. The trunk actually is pretty roomy. It was easy to drive. Good gas mileage. Only could give four stars because I don’t know how it performs long term.
698, a year ago,5,I absolutely love this ride in this car.  It is a quiet and smooth ride.  There is plenty of room in the car.  The trunk is absolutely huge.
699, a year ago,4,Very roomy in the front seat. Great for log trips. Lots of space for luggage. The third row is a plus for kids and carpooling. Just not as roomy back there for adults. The air/heat is adjustable for both the front and back to be set differently.
700, a year ago,2,Not a fan of the focus! It reminded me of a wind up toy car. There was no room for anything
701, a year ago,4,I drove this as a rental car for a week when dad was in the hospital. I liked how the car handled on the highway except the rear window was small.Ford Escape
702, a year ago,2,"I bought this car last year and I am not a fan. There are too many blind spots and I always feel on the verge of getting hit or hitting someone else. There is an extra smaller mirror on top of each side mirror that helps but it takes getting used to. The gas tank is tiny too - only 15 gallons appx and I feel like I am always filling up even though I haven’t been driving much. The inside space is small too - much smaller than the older boxy style Escapes. In my opinion, they never should have changed the body style. The features are nice and I enjoy the sunroof and leather seats but you can got those on any car."
703, a year ago,5,My daughter's first car was a Ford Focus! It drove very well! She loved that car! It was very reliable and she never had any major issues with it
704, a year ago,5,"I own a 2017 escape. It’s a great car for the cost. Roomy, safe, and awesome gas mileage. The smaller suv size it perfect for those for don’t want a small car or a larger suv."
705, a year ago,2,It was okay I'm not really a ford person so I try to avoid it as much as possible. It was one of my friends cars not something I would get personally.
706, a year ago,5,They don't say built Ford tough for nothing! I have a 1995 Ford that is still going strong and when I get a new car it will be Ford also.
707, a year ago,3,"Honestly, my friend owns one, and I'm not th the biggest fan. It's not very comfortable to ride in for long distances, and it's too compact for me. And they have a issue with the transmission going out after so many miles, even if they are newer. But it is good on gas so that's nice. But I don't plan on owning one personally."
708, a year ago,5,Best purchase ever have driven this beauty to almost every state only one thing that has been an issue the cruise control I’ve never been able to get it to work
709, a year ago,5,I love my Ford & always have! It has been an extremely reliable car & has held up well! I rave about my car all the time to anyone in search of a car!
710, a year ago,5,I completed driving school using this car. I had a great experience with it and it was very easy to drive- especially for a new driver.￼
711, a year ago,5,"Me encanta mi auto, es rápido, seguro, económico y deportivo, me encanta ya que tiene mucha tecnología y es fácil de usar y de conducir, su motor es mediano así que no gasta mucho combustible lo recomiendo totalmente para uso en ciudad y carretera ya que tiene. Buena velocidad para correr!!"
712, a year ago,4,it was an older one.  too small for me.  easy to drive.  cute.  not enough base features in my model that i had.
713, a year ago,3,Lots of bells and whistles for the price. Drives nice and smoothly and has a fairly large cargo and trunk space. I really like mine.
714, a year ago,2,Small and very tight fitting. The only thing I liked about my focus was that it was zippy and fast
715, a year ago,2,"Not great on gas at all but has great space and storage/ organization, the back is bigger than the front very little cup holders"
716, a year ago,5,I love my Escape it is the perfect size for me has enough storage for going on vacation. Gas usage is great.
717, a year ago,5,"I had to drive one of these for three weeks while my car was being worked, it was a pleasure to drive."
718, a year ago,4,Ford Fiesta I own a 2013 Ford Fiesta manual transmission.. I bought it used and has a couple of issues. It's very dependable and i love my little car. there are a few issues that need to be taken care of. no radio it was a known issue and a part that needs replacing a lot.
719, a year ago,4,"This was my first big girl purchase, I graduated high school this year and I decided that since I had made it through a year of struggles and unfilled things that we were supposed to do my senior year I wanted this car. it's a super clean and pretty car that gets really good gas mileage and has plenty of storage space. its a safe car and I definitely will be using it for years to come. "
720,a year ago,1,My husband and I had a 2012 Ford Focus hatchback and it was the worst car I've ever had the displeasure of sitting in. The transmission never worked correctly despite multiple repairs. The power steering would just quit sometimes. The ABS (Brakes!!) stopped working once. Just awful.
721, a year ago,5,Reliable and runs smoothly. Has great interior space as well. Great with gas and comfortable to be in.
722, a year ago,5,Best car I've ever owned! Had it for 25 years in n the family and finally sold but it has served me well the whole time. And the people I sold it to love it too. Ford is a decent brand the make great vehicles but the fiesta has always always always been my fave
723, a year ago,4,So I have been a faithful Honda buyer for as long as I can remember. It wasn’t until I had to use a Ford rental that I considered buying a Ford. I had to get a new car and I choose a Ford Edge. It is the perfect size for my family of 4 and came fully loaded. When they say “Built Ford Tough” that’s what they mean!
724,a year ago,5,I enjoyed this vehicle I rented for about a week. I love sitting up high and having lots of space
725, a year ago,5,Loved driving this car. Very comfortable and good on gas mileage. Had leg room for adults in the backseat. Trunk was also a nice size.
726, a year ago,4,"I'm sure this truck was amazing brand new but at 15 years old, it's certainly needs a lot of ongoing maintenance. It still works fine to pull our camper, but the bed is in terrible condition, even for the Midwest. I like the fact that it seats 6 people."
727, a year ago,3,"Reliable diesel engine car for 50+ mile roundtrip daily commute.  I have only the basic model, no bells and whistles."
728, a year ago,5,"Of all Fords, the Escape is my favorite.  Perfect midsized SUV.  Has all the capabilities you could want.  Panoramic sunroof, heated seats, all automated everything including lights and wipers."
729, a year ago,5,"Great midsized car.  Perfect for long road trips, or just to get from A to Z.  Plenty of options to choose from.  Nice car with a user friendly interface."
730, a year ago,5,"I like how stylish this car is, has plenty of room in the backseat for a full size sedan. It is comfortable to drive on road trips and gets pretty good gas mileage. I am 5'10 and can drive comfortably in the front seat. I like the stereo system and navigation is easy to figure out. "
731, a year ago,5,"For the price this is a reliable car, good gas mileage, does well in snow, and is aesthetically pleasing. It is a full size sedan and is cheaper/easier for a mechanic to fix if something goes wrong. The newer models have a good/pleasant look to them. "
732, a year ago,4,"I like the style of the older escapes better. the newer style still looks good but in my humble opinion older style looks better. They are reliable, you get your moneys worth, do well in snow, and get about 30 mpg. Great for a small/compact SUV. "
733, a year ago,3,"Bonne voiture plutôt robuste. Assez grand pour une famille, grand coffre, grand à l’avant et à l’arrière. Agréable à conduire. Prix un peu élevé pour un achat neuf."
734, a year ago,5,I drive a black '06 Ford Mustang. I love it. Hard to change a baby in a two door car but I managed. It's tough. Ford tough 💕
735, a year ago,5,I loved my focus. The hatchback had so much space. When I was rearened by a semi truck I was unscathed. The fuel economy is also amazing.
736, a year ago,5,Spacious and smooth driving .... i used it as a rental car. Yep that’s all that i can remember
737,a year ago,4,"I have over 200,00 miles on this car and it’s still running so I’d say it’s a success overall! I have a 2008 and am basically just driving it now until it stops working before I buy a new car. Mine is nothing fancy but it gets the job done."
738, a year ago,5,I have rented this car a few times and it is by far one of my favorite cars tbh. It’s roomy for my two kids and I good on gas I think I’m so excited to be making this purchasing soon‼️‼️
739, a year ago,5,"Great vehicles! My family is a Ford family and has been since I was a kid and my mom was driving a boat of a crown vic, haha! Last long and perform well, what more needs to be said?!"
740, a year ago,1,I have a 2007 ford focus. This is the most complicated and expensive car to fix and its not even worth the repair. Its nothing but plastic and when one thing breaks an even bigger thing breaks. I would never reccomend someone buying this car and i will never buy a ford again
741, a year ago,5,I had a 2000 ford focus it was a great car i.loved it great on gas not hard to work.on parts inexpensive fun and eadybto.drive
742,a year ago,5,"I have this car and I love it, it is super comfortable, easy to take the family, perfect for children and mom, the chairs are very soft and comfortable, I recommend it."
743,a year ago,3,I drove it once as a rental and it served its purpose but it definitely was not my type of car or what I’m used to.
744, a year ago,4,"Good car. Nothing exceptional, I'd say. It really depends on what you need in a car. It's comfortable inside, drives smooth on the road and city, but I does spend more gas than I expected. I did have an issue with my A/C last summer, though, and researching I got to know that I wasn't only me."
745, a year ago,4,It's a great car for work and errands. Amazing on gas but after your kids are past 6 years old....... its hard to have passengers. My Husband and kids are tall so he's either trying to scrunch his legs forward or the kids get crunched. It is affordable. Ford Focus
746, a year ago,5,"Best car I ever had! She's old, a 2008, and has over 100,000 miles on her and she's never given me a lick of trouble.  I'm soon to be in the market for a new vehicle and I'm definitely purchasing another Ford Edge."
747, a year ago,5,I love the gas mileage in this car the space inside is awesome and it’s a perfect family car
748, a year ago,5,This car is great! I think it has the perfect amount of space for a 4 person family. The trunk is exceptionally big for the car which is really nice. Never have had a transmission or engine problem. I love this car and would absolutely recommend it to family and friends.
749, a year ago,5,Yo estoy fascinada con estos carros la verdad que es una buena calidad me siento todo tranquilo
750, a year ago,5,"It was a smooth car and I liked it it was very comfortable and I felt very safe I liked that everything is working great the air conditioner was perfect, Is a car that I wouldn’t buy but I was passenger in and I really liked the experience."
751, a year ago,5,"Great little car. Not as great as my Flex, but great. Lots of problems with the Synch systems so make sure you get that under your warranty. Dealerships will hassle you and not want to make it right."
752, a year ago,5,"this car rides SO smooth! love all of the features in the dash, however i don’t like that the door unlock button is in the center instead of on the doors. i believe this car is worth the money, even a used one!"
753, a year ago,5,My husband has a Ford F150 that I drive often. He loves it and won't buy anything other than a Ford. He keeps saying he's selling my car and buying me a big Ford truck!
754, a year ago,5,I love the room it has and that it is just right for the height. It rides so nice also. Plus with the back it fits so much stuff when moving.
755, a year ago,4,I love the room that it had. I also loved the seat cause they were so comfortable. Not a big fan of being so low but mileage was amazing.
756, a year ago,5,I love Ford and I love their products so this is pretty biased but it is an amazing company that makes awesome cars! This car specifically has get up and go to it and is well made and can definitely hold up well in a car wreck!
757, a year ago,5,"I love this car for its comfort, it is silent, spacious, and smooth to handle, it has a lot of stability in the curves and a lot of stability in snow territory, its technology is very new"
758, a year ago,5,My Ford Focus is amazing! It is such a smooth ride every ride! I love how my Focus Hatchback SE takes Flex Fuel making the gas prices go WAY down! Flex Fuel also makes my filling up times cut in half! Owning this car has saved me a lot of money! I would recommend this vehicle for someone who is a daily driver or who has a delivery service type business. I work as a independent contractor so I need a reliable vehicle and my Ford Focus Hatchback SE is definitely an awesome choice for me!
759, a year ago,4,This car has great get up and go power. I’ve never had any issues with my car. I keep it well maintained abs serviced. The only downside is a car seat. A normal rear facing toddler seat has a hard time fitting. Definitely looking to upgrade because of this.
760, a year ago,5,Gets you to point a time point b I have no complaints. I would recommend fir a 1st time driver
761, a year ago,4,The only complaint I have with my Ford Fiesta is there's no cruise control. Other then that it's very roomy for how compact it is. When I opened the trunk I was extremely surprised how huge it was. I love my Fiesta it gets amazing gas mileage!
762, a year ago,2,"Even though it was nice to look at, the seating is cramped. Me being a heavier woman, I need that room all around me. And I just felt cramped. It had a nice smooth ride though."
763,a year ago,5,"Confortable ,muy buena mecanica ,facil de manejar.
Ideal para ir de viaje .
Muy buena atención del servis."
764, a year ago,5,"I’ve had my focus since 2016 and she’s been a stable, luxurious car given the price rage/type of vehicle. The leather is the most luxurious butter soft leather in a standard hatchback that I’ve ever felt, great radio system and basically no problems with this car."
765, a year ago,3,"I liked my Ford Escape, it’s stylish and has a smooth drive. But the wheel wells rusted out of both of my escapes very quickly which I think is a known design flaw."
766, a year ago,5,"I bought a 202 Escape in July of 2020, and I absolutely love it.  I had always driven small SUVs, and this one is feels more spacious inside than anything else I've had.  It gets 29 MPG and saves me a ton of money.  I got the SEL package and the interior is beautiful."
767, a year ago,2,"I like my Ford Escape. I’ve had it for 4 years with minimal problems. However one thing I do not like is the placement of the battery. I scrape my hands every time I try to put jumper cables on and in order to change the battery to have to take apart several other things to get to it. It’s a big inconvenience, I went to Auto Zone thinking they could change the battery for me, however they said due to the location, they can not and that it has to be done by myself or the dealership. I myself do not have the tools to do it myself, so now I have to pay 3 times as much to get my battery replace at the dealership. It’s very frustrating."
768, a year ago,2,"I got this used a ford dealership in vt, needless to say it is quite a junk vehicle. It has so many rust and mechanical issues."
769, a year ago,4,This I bought  a used 2011 Ford Fusion and I love it. It is great on gas.  I love that I can connect my phone to it.  It handles great with all wheel drive. My only con is the bushings that ford use make my very noisy in the summer when it hot outside other than that I have no problem with it.
770, a year ago,5,Très jolie ! Très confortable! De bonne qualité et facile à conduire ! Je la conseille
771, a year ago,5,Excellente! C’est l’une des voitures que je préfère de chez Ford !! Elle est très jolie et confortable ! Je recommande ! 😍
772, a year ago,4,I drive this daily for work and it’s a great size and ride. Has a bit of road noise but is comfortable and better without winter tires. There’s not much room in the back for car seats so I don’t use it with my children.
773, a year ago,4,It was a nice ride to ride in. The layout of the car was nice and it fit a car seat in the back of the car.  There are a lot of color options
774, a year ago,3,"I got it for a good price, but it was over priced, there is a LOT of expensive maintenance that the car needs, honestly I would not get a fiesta again"
775, a year ago,5,Great car my brother had for years and still driving...very dependable and descent gas mileage...great for a driver just starting out.
776, a year ago,4,I liked this vehicle I thought it was comfortable. I feel it’s good for a small family. Felt spacious
777, a year ago,4,"I liked how this car had back up cams, heated seats and remote start. I used this car while mine was in the shop."
778, a year ago,5,"I currently drive a 2012 Ford Explorer. Other than routine maintenance I have not had any major issues and am closing in on 200,000 miles. It is an excellent car and we keep going back to Ford SUVs."
779, a year ago,3,I love this car because it belonged to my grandfather. But Ford has more recalls than I’ve ever dealt with and pretty crappy repair. I had to take my car in 5 separate times for a transmission recall just for them to break my door locks (guess that was a recall too)... now the door locks are on recall again and I don’t want to deal with it. Over it!
780, a year ago,1,"Terrible customer service. My 2018 F150 has had problems since the day I drove it off of the lot. I understand all vehicles have issues but the level of service I have received is awful. I drove for 4 months this past summer without AC and stained my seats from sweating. Fords excuse - ""parts are delayed because of Covid and we don't give out loaner vehicles for a simple inconvenience."""
781, a year ago,5,"My has a fusion and I’ve had to use it several times. It gets great gas mileage, ample leg space & head room, nice stereo, & drives really well. I would recommend this car to anyone that’s looking for a stylish and affordable “luxury” vehicle."
782,a year ago,4,"Ford focus is an affordable option for a vehicle. I trust the Ford brand and their vehicle safety is a contributing factor. The Ford Focus has a large trunk area, which isperfect for grocery getting. The vehicle drives smoothly and handles well."
783, a year ago,3,"Decent sized smaller SUV. The AWD is nice, but I would not get the FWD version of this vehicle. Mostly reliable vehicles. They're not the most attractive looking SUV though. The interiors seem kind of cheap. Keep up on maintenance with these vehicles. "
784, a year ago,5,"Good handling , great space and just a great all around car also on the list of car purchases which do I choose though? 🥲"
785, a year ago,3,"I was only a passenger in this car. The Focus feels small inside and everything is plastic. The car did drive smooth and had a surprisingly large trunk for a car of that size. Tge sound system was nicer than expected.   It looked nice on the outside, smooth lines and a nice design."
786, a year ago,4,My 2013 Escape has over 120k miles on it. With regular maintenance this vehicle has been reliable and comfortable to drive.
787, a year ago,5,"Owned a 2009 Ford Fusion. Good car as far as the engine is concerned.  A few minor things would be that the door handles on both front doors from the inside broke, due to them being cheaply constructed and I would have to roll the window down to open the door from the outside."
788, a year ago,5,I love my 97 ford ranger I drive him everyday I called my truck a him cos it's a 5 speed I wish they would send me a new ford ranger ...I want a brand new
789, a year ago,4,Decent car for the price. Has really good gas mileage which is why I bought one. Have had some issues here and there but never anything major.
790, a year ago,5,"Ford escapes are exceptional cars, not only are they four wheel drive but they are awesome in snow. The stereo system in this vehicle is top notch and the navigation system is easy to use. This car isn’t too big or too small, it truly is  “just the right size”"
791, a year ago,2,"Had it be has my fit car had so many problems with the transmission, very small space and even had a recall that the company didn’t cover"
792, a year ago,5,"My first car that I purchased on my own. Cute, zippy car that lasted longer than I could have expected! I enjoyed it so much we got another one!"
793, a year ago,3,It is one the cheapest SUV that you can afford. It does the job but somehow you can hear each noise from outside of the car. It gives you a headache after some point. 
794,a year ago,5,We have a 2002 Ford F250 that we bought to use as a plow truck.  Great truck and very reliable!  I would definitely recommend!
795, a year ago,5,"We’ve owned this car since 2014, purchased new off the lot. Has under 98,000 miles.  We’ve owned other pos cars (2013 Dodge Dart and 2016 Chevy Malibu ) and this car by far is superior to either of those. It’s has had a few recalls, but very few issues. Love it and recommend them to anyone looking for a dependable car."
796, a year ago,5,"Este vehículo es muy cómodo, ya que mi experiencia fue pasajero los asientos traseros se acomodan al cuerpo lo que hacen es relajar al pasajero, por lo cual la experiencia es muy buena genera tranquilidad"
797, a year ago,3,In a Chevrolet girl and while this was a nice car to look at in my opinion there were performance issues. Cute but not reliable
798, a year ago,4,I love my car for myself and my daughter to do some shopping and running around. It's great on gas so it's prefect for traveling too! The only downside is space. It isn't big enough for large families or furniture. This is really for 4 people max.
799, a year ago,2,"I received my 2004 ford escape this year, my dad gave it to me because i cant afford to purchase one, so for a car i didnt pay for i cant complain. Its old now and not in good shape but it gets me to work daily to care for my mom, SO FAR."
800, a year ago,5,"Never thought I would say this but I love my Ford. I've always been a Honda type, but I had to drive a Ford Escape for a demo car at work and I fell in love with it. Good car at a low price with everything I needed. I couldn't say no and have no regrets. As they always say,  don't knock it til you try it!!!"
801, a year ago,5,"Amazing compact tough car. Gives you great gas mileage, very roomy and comfortable. The turn is excellent for storing just about anything, I've even carried furniture in the trunk. The car is a very smooth drive and shifts easily. The interior is sporty yet very comfy. The outside is sporty yet classy. I just can't say enough about this amazing car and it's sad that it is no longer made. Ford did themselves a disservice there."
802,a year ago,4,Unfortunately the ford focus I had I got into a pretty bad accident in so I am happy to say that it is a very safe car. I walked away with no injuries all airbags deployed as intended. As far as before the accident I never had a problem it's just your standard 4 cylinder great on gas. I used it for mostly work.
803, a year ago,5,What a luxurious car! From its smooth leather heated seats to the sleek black paint. Well priced too! Such a roomy back seat with room to stretch your legs while on a family vacation.
804,a year ago,4,Gas mileage is ok. It has had transmission issues that had to be repaired in the first year. Seats are hard to adjust for comfort
805, a year ago,4,I love my car but living in the midwest with the snow makes it a challenging issue. It is great on gas but doesn't do well with ice. Very nice and compact. The backseat doesn't have a lot of room. It was reasonable for the price and product. I would recommend this for a summer car.
806, a year ago,5,I had a Ford Escape six years ago we bought it brand new.  It was fully loaded and I loved it.  It was perfect for me.  I think it is tight for a family not much leg room in the back seat.  It comes with some awesome package offers.  Technology is right up there with the luxury brands.  The kick lift gate is a feature I loved the most.  Ford usually has great offers too.
807, a year ago,5,I simply loved my 2005 Ford Focus SE it was perfect for me. Plenty of trunk space for why I needed it and had good mileage per gallon.
808, a year ago,5,"My roommate just bought one. And this car is really cool. The seats are very comfortable. Its nice to drive. I love driving it. It has all the bells and whistles, unlike my older car. And its been a really reliable car for her. It has me reconsidering my next purchase for a newer car."
809,a year ago,5,"I drive a Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition.  Yes, it is not a newer model of Ford however, I absolutely love it! I love the room and all the extras that it has with it! It is very affordable and it gets excellent gas mileage. I am a Ford Lady now and will recommend Ford to anyone. They build lasting Automobiles"
810, a year ago,4,Good deal for what you get. You can fit a lot in it with the seats down. Very fuel efficient. Love the moon roof. Leg room and head space in the back seat is a bit tight for people over 6 feet.
811, a year ago,3,Compact sedan pretty basic Ford Focus    Good gas mileage E85 and regular gas compatible Ford Focus  great trunk space!  All media and ac/heat controls are on a dashboard panel all buttons and knobs are simple and easy to access and controls.
812, a year ago,5,"Been a Ford girl ever since I got my driver's license. I love their look, and they're dependable vehicles. I've always loved every Ford product I have owned."
813, a year ago,5,"I got the stripped down basic model because, let's face it, when I bougbt it I was newly divorced with bad credit and I needed a new car because the one I had wouldn't pass inspection to renew the plates. I needed something cheap and reliable. This focus fit the bill and now 4 years later I'm kicking myself for not making at least a few upgrades, like power windows and cruise control. It has been a dream to drive and I have no doubt that I will have it for a very long time, but when they say ""base model"" they really do mean that they stripped out all the bells and whistles! The focus is the bottom end price point, but if you pay attention to what you are getting, you can have a small car, with luxury car amenities. I chose to pass on the heated leather power interior with Dolby surround sound, mood lighting, and wood vrain details, but if that's what you want ask for the upgrade, they'll be happy to give it to you."
814, a year ago,4,"I like my car, it’s a bit old but has been working well for over 6+ years. The brakes do seem to go quite often, have done them 3x in last four years"
815,a year ago,5,"A perfect fit for q family of 4 or even 5 .. very comfortable and with a lot of space in the trunk, also the sync is very helpful"
816, a year ago,5,I love my Ford escape. It’s roomy enough to be able to carry as many things as I need from the grocery store at the hardware store or to carry the family. I also have two big dogs that fit very comfortably in the trunk. Would recommend great family car
817, a year ago,4,"Great little car and good on mileage and great price, the transmission computer issue and the leaky clutch seal on the automatic manual transmission is a problem but it was replaced for me on warranty. If they fix these issues I would definitely buy this again."
818, a year ago,4,"It’s a great vehicle! I have had more recall parts than I can count, but I’ve never had a problem with the vehicle. A couple panels over time have come loose, especially the trunk from pulling it down. But overall very snazzy. I get compliments all the time and I have a 2014."
819, a year ago,3,Had a 2000 model and even though it got good gas mileage and was a decent ride the cabin was not the biggest or comfiest and had MANY issues back to back. Motor and then wiring harness. I will never buy one again and would not recommend a ford at all.
820, a year ago,5,I like the style of the vehicle . The way it drives I wasn’t expecting it . I drove it myself .
821, a year ago,4,It's a nice vehicle. I've driven one a few times when going out with my mom. For it being a 2013 she has already had a few issues and repairs with it. The trunk space is great. The backseat is roomy and not claustrophobic. I would recommend this just do some research.
822, a year ago,5,Loved my Ford focus took me over 100k miles before she conked out like my gallbladder. Didn't have any bells and whistles. Had a cassette player and roll down windows. No tilt/telescopic stearing. Just a little roller chair up and down. Sad to see the compact ggo more full size but I guess that's carevoution
823, a year ago,5,"We have 2 Fusion’s - 2009 with 40,000 miles on it and in perfect shape and we have a 2019 Fusion Titanium hybrid and it is so quiet it is amazing.  Both are great cars.  Highly recommend the Fusion."
824, a year ago,5,"great car, super smooth, great on gas and has great electronic features. would recommend"
825, a year ago,5,Has never failed me. Is a 2008 red one and I bought it used. Might change it soon. It’s been so long but I love my car
826, a year ago,2,I was NOT A FAN of this car. I drove a 2019 Ford Focus while waiting for my new car and everything about it felt off. The gear shift was hard to manage and would often shift randomly or slip. It was also very difficult to see out the back to change lanes. 2 stars because it did have some nice features inside
827, a year ago,5,I highly recommend! My car is very smooth to drive! I’ve had almost a year and no unexpected visits to the auto shop!
828, a year ago,5,"My parents gifted me this car when I was grade 9, back home. This car is great for beginners and drives so smooth."
829, a year ago,4,"My husband has a Ford Fiesta standard shift and it's a great little car! Fantastic gas mileage! We get around 38 miles to the gallon! This car however, because it is small, does not have much room for people in the back seat. For children, it's not too bad but for adults, their knees are digging in the back of the seat."
830, a year ago,5,4 of my 5 kids have all driven an escape. It’s a good vehicle for the price and handles well in all weather. They last a long time.
831, a year ago,5,Ese automóvil mi padre lo manejó por años y casi no le fallaba y se conservaba excelente a pesar del uso rudo que le dábamos.
832, a year ago,5,"I love my 05 Ford Focus! She is such a reliable vehicle, and has gotten me all over the country! She’s the best car ever!"
833, a year ago,4,okay ride . would rather be a passenger than an owner of this vehicle . nothing to special
834, a year ago,5,"Good on gas , comfortable, drives amazing and so much more . Cons is they vehicle shrinks the make each yr"
835,a year ago,4,I like him and I think he is a good guy and I am very proud of him for the great thing he does for me and his family and friends and family and friends who are very happy and happy to be a part of the world and the world is a big part of the world and the world is a big part of the world and the world is a big part of the world and the world is a big part of the world and the world
836, a year ago,5,"Smooth ride, beautiful exterior. Easy to use controls. Good safety features. Has updated power plugs, including USB ports. Overall good, stable car."
837, a year ago,5,"Wonderful car, efficient gas mileage, beautiful exterior and interior. Smooth ride. Easy to use controls. Easy maneuverability, smooth ride. Highly recommend, and affordable."
838, a year ago,3,"Don’t love this car. As a passenger at least! I feel it’s kind of tight space wise, and the automatic features aren’t my style. But a good safe choice. Just not my style"
839, a year ago,4,I love the Ford car brand.  This is not my Ford but there was none of my Ford brand.  My Ford is a Ford Explorer.  They are very good car
840, a year ago,4,Good car for a medium sized family. Comfortable on long trips. Good gas mileage. Enjoyed the Sync options.
841, a year ago,4,"Good vehicle for a small family or just yourself. Good mileage, just make sure all recalls are done because earlier ones had transmission issues. But once they are fixed, the vehicle runs great."
842, a year ago,1,THE WORST. i honestly don’t know anyone that says “hey i love the escape” i’ve been given this vehicle as a rental and i couldn’t wait until i got my car back. it was just a under performing car overall.
843, a year ago,3,I am not a fan of sedans to be honest. i like larger SUVs but i was given a fusion as a rental vehicle and i feel like the interior was just so plain. It’s probably a affordable vehicle but i honestly wouldn’t know.
844, a year ago,4,"I have an older version of a Ford Focus, it’s an 2001 but I love it. This was my first car and it was the best first car I could have wanted, it drove nicely was good on gas, I have no complaints. I can’t imagine that the new version wouldn’t be the same thing!"
845, a year ago,5,"My dad has had this car. It’s super nice and comfortable. I like how big and spacious it is but for him as the driver it is sometimes very hard to find parking space, mostly in the city."
846, a year ago,5,My mom has this car and it is very nice. I have always traveled super comfortable. Both in the front seat and in the back seats. The trunk is super spacey too.
847, a year ago,4,"This car is pretty good, and I can see why they have such a dedicated following. The power is good, handling is crisp, the tech on the car is better than most comparable cars, and the storage space is pretty good if you get a hatchback. The recaro front seats are my biggest issue with this car. I can never seem to get comfortable no matter how I adjust them."
848, a year ago,4,"I have the Ford Fusion Energi Titanium and I love the car. Especially the mileage and cost of gas, I hate how I have to sacrifice trunk space for the electric battery which only gives me about 20 miles per 2 hour charge. I’ve driven this car for the past 6+ years and I’m ready for an upgrade."
849, a year ago,1,Garbage. Theres issues with the tranmission clutch which has been recalled but now that the lawsuit is settled they no longer will fix it for free. Something to do with the fact they dont use hydraulic fluid on their clutches which seems really dumb. I got my car at 79000 km and ive had to have the clutch replaced TWICE already and i have no idea how many times the previous owner had it fixed !!
850,a year ago,5,Great car . Great on gas. .. buy another one. Ford rocks.. never own anything else than a ford.. #ford...... M
851, a year ago,5,"I really enjoy my car. Reasonable on gas, great miliage, has Bluetooth and a back up camera."
852, a year ago,5,This has been a perfect car for both my girls first car!!  Perfect size.  The only con I have is the plastic door handle inside. Both cars the inside handle has broken
853, a year ago,3,Older models seem to be really shaky. I've talked to many and this is common. Newer seem to be better.
854, a year ago,4,I like it. I do think it doesn't have a lot of get up and go. My lease is up soon and I am thinking about going back to Jeep.
855, a year ago,5,I really like this car a lot especially the back up camera that it has its very handy
856, a year ago,4,"No was looking for a Ford escort. 1st car I got at 18. Little compact car , got excellent gas mileage. The pro was it was mine and I rode it til the wheels wore off. Affordable car."
857,a year ago,5,"Sur le plan de la conduite, c'est un régal. L'ensemble est incisif, presque chirurgical. Même avec ""seulement"" 115 ch, on peut se rendre compte de l'excellence de ce chassis. La direction fait s'inscrire précisément la voiture en courbe, cette dernière ne prenant pas une once de roulis."
858, a year ago,3,It’s a decent car for the size. I haven’t driven any far distance to know wether it could go the distance and last. I think I would improve this car by maybe adding a bit more drive . I would recommend or maybe college student.
859, a year ago,5,I like the newer version of focus. It has some speed to the pedal when your not use to it. 😂 the one I was in not good in snow. I would give this car all wheel drive or something for in the winter time.
860, a year ago,5,My daddy was a Ford man so I guess I'm a Ford girl. Ford is made in the USA and it's a very great quality car. Mine is blue with a sunroof of course. I can rely on my Ford in fact I have owned it now for a 5 years and so far it's still runs perfect! It is great on gas the only thing I would like to change is it is just a little too small for me now other than that I love my focus. When I buy my next car it will be a Ford but a little bit larger!
861, a year ago,5,"Encontrar un autos sobresalientes, con excelente relación valor precio, comportamiento dinámico, equipamiento y calidad interior, aunque a veces estos productos no aparezcan de forma inmediata en la mente es la mejor forma para iniciar con un buen auto"
862, a year ago,3,I believe it was just the year for my car that was the reason for our problem. It was an overall great vehicle but issue with speeding up from a stop that would make the vehicle kind of shake. Small in space but good overall
863, a year ago,5,I loved my ford escape. I would have kept it until it wouldn't have drove anymore but unfortunately a deer totaled if earlier this year.
864, a year ago,5,"My brother has this car and it provides a nice smooth ride. I enjoy all the electronic features/amenities in this car. Heated seats are a must for winters up north. A sun roof is a great option to for the summer. Comfortable for passengers in the backseat, and the trunk has plenty of space."
865, a year ago,2,"Didn’t really like the fusion, I couldn’t wait to get rid of it. Had a hard time seeing out the side, there was big blind spot. Also, heater was weak"
866, a year ago,4,"Love my Ford Focus!! Have had for a couple years now and have never had any issue with it!! I definitely recommend a Ford Focus to anybody who wants a reliable, safe, spacious car! I also have Bluetooth which I love"
867, a year ago,4,I owned a 2007 Ford Focus. I purchased this car brand new. It drove really good. Please eliminate upholstery problem. The material used to make the car seats is horrible.
868, a year ago,5,"I love the design of this car, it looks very modern and the colors available are all fire! I like it is a big car and looks elegant. It’s affordable as well."
869,a year ago,4,Nice car. Love the technology inside. Too many buttons on the steering wheel though. But nicely powered and gas mileage is good. Great discounts to buy or lease. Love the colors
870,a year ago,4,Lovely small SUV! Gas mileage is nice and the comfort of the vehicle is great. It is a compact suv so be warned. You Cant carry a tin if stuff like I love to so. It's very car like and super easy to drive
871,a year ago,5,"I love this car. It is the perfect size for me, a single adult female. It has a good cargo space and its easy to drive."
872, a year ago,5,I own a 2016 Ford Focus ST — super sporty car but also a great grocery getter! Love the Recaro seats  push starts doing keyless entry.
873, a year ago,5,"El color está súper bonito me encanta porque resalta mucho en ese modelo, por dentro tiene muchas cosas geniales lo cual me encanta"
874, a year ago,5,"Está super equipada, me encanta el color que tiene y por dentro está súper bonita me encanta , aparte funciona súper bien"
875, a year ago,5,I love my lil  baby she runs beautiful. She’s great on gas! She keeps me warm! She fits into all parking spaces!! When getting car parts it’s very affordable.
876, a year ago,5,"I loved this car. The outside looked great, the interior was fantastic. It drove very smooth and had great gas milage. I really would like another one"
877, a year ago,4,It was a cute little car and drove perfect at fir as t but then it broke down quite a bit. Great gas milage though
878, a year ago,4,This is the car i drive for work. It’s a safe little car but the battery does often.
879, a year ago,5,This car is pretty good. I dont have to much to day about. Pro is that it is super spacious. Has plenty of cup holders. Cons they air vent fall in to the dash to easily
880, a year ago,3,I have always heard great things about these cars and many people have them. It was comfy to ride in but I can not speak to how it drives since I was only a passenger. My friend said that they would definitely recommend this car
881, a year ago,5,"I love my car! It’s comfortable, reliable, and drives really smooth. I commute to work through all weather, and I know I can count on this car."
882, a year ago,4,"Not the best vehicle I've had, however, not the worst either. Overall, a descent vehicle in the compact SUV class. The crossover has good passenger and cargo space, as well as sharp steering and handling. The Interior is my favorite because you can tell it's  well-designed and features high-quality materials. The downside & problems I've personally experienced (along with many others) include low gas mileage or more notably transmission slippage still early in its life. After research, it was found Escapes are notorious for transmission issues, but only if u do not maintain them (which i did noT). So your probably wondering what's my overall or general assessment of a Ford Escape- i enjoyed it for the class it represents, I would own another one if the price was  but only if I could buy it used/low miles.  low price"
883, a year ago,5,Super Ausstattung zu einem akzeptablen Preis. Der Laderaum ist schön groß und ich konnte immer alles einladen. Für die hinteren Fahrgäste war ausreichend Platz auch bei längeren Strecken. Der Sitz Komfort ist klasse und das Navi war sehr leicht zu verstehen. Ich bin gerne mit dem Focus gefahren.
884, a year ago,5,This car also it was a very nice comfortable room is Eishas car as well as it is cute and appealing to the eye and also you got your moneys worth as miles to the gallon
885, a year ago,5,"This is so nice, cute SUV I would rent this car often I would drive this anytime. Very comfortable to drive."
886, a year ago,5,"My mom always wanted one of these. And guess who has one now, my husband and I. Comfortable, super affordable in gas!!!"
887, a year ago,5,Fun little fast car. Comfortable great space all around. Easy to drive and to figure out.
888, a year ago,5,"My mom has a Escape Titanium Hybrid for eight  months now, and although the price tag is somewhat hefty, this car is worth it.  The safety features are amazing and it even parallel parks itself.  The ride is comfortably smooth, and the power is just fine in town and also on the freeway. Gas mileage is as good or even better than what the sticker shows All in all, this is an excellent car"
889, a year ago,3,"I love my car. I do not love the constant transmission problems. I love the technology features, back up camera, Bluetooth, fog lights, tire sensors, great stereo, safety features. I do not love the mechanical problems. For the price,  I would say weigh your options. Is it worth the price, yes. But the resale / trade value is terrible."
890, a year ago,4,"I used to drive an older model escape and liked that car a lot, so I test drive a newer model one. Smooth ride, plenty of room, sporty. Middle of the road suv."
891, a year ago,4,"My car is a 2007 Ford Focus, it gets me from A to B and has only left me stranded on the highway once!"
892,a year ago,3,Small car. Not very tech savvy but has all the basics that you’d want in a car. Small screen and not awd so not very good at handling snow. This is one of the cheapest cars on the market and very reliable so great for someone on a budget or first time car.
893, a year ago,5,"We've had our Focus for four years now, we love it and this time of year the heated seats are a bonus! This is the first SUV either of us have ever owned and we will always have one from now on. Great on gas, comfortable,  roomy and love that we ger notifications when something is needed."
894, a year ago,3,"The Focus is a nice car, but extremely small. I was the passenger and there was an infant seat in the back. I’m rather tall and my knees were touching the dash. It seemed like a nice vehicle but the size is not conducive to family/kid travel. I also didn’t feel the most secure. We live in a snowy state and the light body makes for a lot of slide offs or getting stuck in the slush."
895,a year ago,5,"Esta marca sin duda si es buena no excelente como las demás mencionadas,quizás para mí la mejor que la kia,pero si buena,sus productos de autos son buenos y sus graficos excelentes"
896, a year ago,5,I have the hatchback and i love  my little car.. it is good on gas and looks nice.. it is a little@smaller if you have kids and such but overall great
897,a year ago,4,It’s nice it’s got great gas mileage a lot better than hubby’s old jeep but I don’t care for the not having good pick up speed to jump in and out of things maybe it’s how newer cars work but it has this thing we’re it revs up the engine and takes a minute to wind down when you push the gas it’s weird buts my first car to payment and is new so maybe that’s normal ehh￼￼
898, a year ago,1,"I’d rate this car less if I could. Ford is garbage and this car is no exception. The passenger airbag is malfunctioning, the windows no longer work and it’s falling apart way sooner than you would expect."
899, a year ago,5,I was a passenger on this car when I called Uber last week and I fell in love as soon as I got inside. Hopefully I can convince hubby to get this as a family car.
900, a year ago,5,"It’s incredible, inside it’s bigger, it’s automatic too!! So you have to forget the one toe theee four etc 🙃🙃🙃
You’ll love this car it’s affordable ❤️❤️❤️❤️
A little be expensive but it’s really amazing"
901, a year ago,5,"We just bought our first Ford Escape used from a local dealership .It's a little small for my 6ft.6"" husband .The ride is smooth ,came,with some bells and whistles. Like Sirius, cruise control,blue tooth and many more. Ford Escape Ford Motor Company"
902,a year ago,5,"This is my third Ford in a row. My second kept me, my husband, and four month old baby safe when we were in a terrible car accident. We have gotten the same car three times in a row because we trust the structure, integrity, and control of the vehicle."
903,a year ago,4,"I love my 2012 focus, but I do wish the console was designed better/had more useable storage. Plus, it’s had a lot of recalls. That gets me a bit nervous. But, it drives great and I’ve had it for 9 years and so love it."
904, a year ago,4,Good little car. My sister loves hers. Had a few recalls though so be careful. Reliable little econo car.
905, a year ago,5,Ford trucks are just awesome 10 put of 10. A little pricey if you ask me but its a truck what do you expect lol.
906, a year ago,2,I really really disliked this car and that is putting it nicely. I will never own another Ford vehicle in my life. I have driven other fusions than the one I owned and they all just drove completely terrible. Absolutely do not recommends
907, a year ago,1,I have owned many cars. I currently have a Ford Escape Titanium and a Ford Focus.  The gas mileage in my Escape is terrible(they have looked at it several times). My SIL’a F-150 gets better gas mileage. The electronics short out or go off when I am at a stop light and then when I am about to hit something they don’t alarm. The focus. Don’t even get me started on the recalls. Was going to buy an F150.  Never ever again Ford Motor Company!
908,a year ago,4,Voirure un peu 4x4. Esthétiquement très jolie.je l as trouve très pratique. Personnellement j ai appris avec cette voiture et elle est vraiment facil d'accès pour ce qui des places c est un peu moin le cas. Pour ce qui est du comfort rien a dire
909, a year ago,5,Love my Ford car has everything that I could need in a car great for long trips or short trips love the Hibyrd  Amazing beautiful car happy that I purchased it would recommend it to others I love It￼
910, a year ago,1,"I don’t like the design, they seem to rust fast. I don’t recommend anything made by Ford."
911, a year ago,5,"I owed a Fusion for almost a decade.  This was the best car I have ever owned.  It was dependable and required only the basic of maintenance in that 10 year period.  Oil changes, tires, battery and brakes.  The only thing outside of the basic maintenance was replacing a thermostat.  I would have driven this car forever had I not been in a car accident that totaled my Fusion.  100% recommend."
912, a year ago,4,Blind spots while driving! I’ve mainly just been a passenger in this vehicle. It does have a large trunk area. The interior lights are bright which were a plus.
913, a year ago,4,Its fine. Just fine. Its not the fanciest or the most comfortable or most reliable car I've ever owned. It looks nice and will get you from point A to point B.
914, a year ago,3,"I used this as a rental car. Definitely was not my favorite. Not bad. However , I am used to a Subaru SUV and it made this car feel really small and hard to drive. Not for me."
915,a year ago,5,I love it is fantastic everyday I use my car is the car everybody need cause this car is fast
916, a year ago,4,I love this product. My mom has had two different of this cars. I definitely like the newer style. The only thing I don't like is when the car shuts off when you are stopped at light or stop sign.
917, a year ago,5,"I love my car!  I can fit a ton of stuff in my trunk, with Christmas here it helps prevent people from seeing bags. This is a very affordable car.  I do most all of the maintenance and repairs myself."
918, a year ago,4,"Je connais pas vraiment la voiture et je ne suis pas une experte dans ce domaine, mais je trouve le design extérieur vraiment magnifique"
919, a year ago,5,"We bought the ford focus turnier 2018 model and it's a very family-friendly car. It has a very comfortable seating area with larger bonet. The mileage could be improved, currently our car has around 8.5l/100km. The price for a new car starts around 20k€, but there are many options available also for one or two year old car for a cheaper price. Ford Focus"
920, a year ago,5,I had it 2 years ago I love it it’s very confortable good price and easy to drive definitely I recommend it
921, a year ago,5,Exelente muy cómodo y fácil de manejar en especial cuando voy con mi familia a otra ciudad y es muy económico en gasolina 
922, a year ago,5,I love my car. It rides smooth and has some zip! My kids (15 and 9) fit comfortably in the back seat with plenty of room.  The trunk is huge and holds lots of luggage. We fit 2 large and 3 small suitcases in there.
923, a year ago,4,"I purchased the 2020 Ford Escape and it drives very well. However, there have been a few issues with the rear camera and there was a recall with the brake system. The only good thing is that Ford has sent out recall notices and has a fix for these issues. Other than those things, so far, the Escape drives very well and is definitely an upgrade from my Ford Focus; in terms of vehicle space and technology. Also, the gas mileage is **chef’s kiss**."
924,a year ago,4,"I've had two Escapes and they have both been very good overall. Small/Medium SUV that has space, doesn't feel like I'm driving a tank, and saves on gas."
925, a year ago,5,"Ma sœur possède un Ford Escape, je monte dedans presque toutes les semaines ! Elle est très pratique avec leurs deux enfants, spacieuse, confortable et très fiable ! Moi même j’ai un Ford et j’adore cette marque de voiture !"
926, a year ago,5,"J’adore cette voiture, car elle n’est pas trop grosse pour se garer en ville et je la trouve comfortable ! La fiabilité des pièces est top, je n’ai jamais eu de pannes ou de problèmes avec cette voiture !"
927, a year ago,5,I have a Ford mustang convertible and absolutely love it. I love that the parts are cheap and easy to replace myself or with the help of a handy friend.
928, a year ago,1,Unreliable. Everything has broken inside from the radio to the engine. Not worth the price for how long it barely lasts. Wouldn’t recommend this car to my worst enemy. Save your money for a better car.
929, a year ago,2,"My husband had a Ford Focus, and I hated it. It drove rough. The gas mileage was not that great. It was not spacious. We experienced issues with the tires and struts.   We will not purchase another Ford vehicle. The service was also terrible."
930, a year ago,5,Great car good on gas very safe for your family and feels luxurious couldn't ask for a better car this is a must try at least a test drive
931, a year ago,5,"It’s my moms. The hybrid part is great, saving the planet and good on the gas budget. Super roomy front seat, my dog loves the fabric in the back"
932, a year ago,4,"I’m a fan of the Ford Escape! Small but not too small, good on gas mileage... and I’ve seen some of the brand new Ford Escapes and the look has been so upgraded! It looks awesome!"
933,a year ago,3,"My Ford Focus and have a complicated relationship lol. It drives like a dream considering that it’s a 16 year old car HOWEVER I am CONSTANYLY having to make repairs, it truly is a hassle. My advice, don’t go old and cheap with cars, the payments are worth it."
934, a year ago,4,This was my first big girl purchase. It was super good on gas & perfect for me at the time. The only thing I didn’t like was it always made a weird noise but when I took it in they said all these cars make that noise but other than that I like it.
935,a year ago,5,Exelence ery good exellence auto comodo moderno va con cualquier etilo de vida me gusta mucho moderno amplio va con  cualquier odrsona que legustelomejor
936, a year ago,2,"Too small for me, stability is always questionable for me when I drive a Ford. I love that is made in US, it does get good mileage. The Ford Fiesta was too small for my needs. We rented one and we drove one provided by employee. It’s just an okay car."
937, a year ago,3,"Ok vehicle. Price is good. Mileage is good. I like to have more space and I didn’t feel that the vehicle was reliable. Stability while driving on the interstate was not at 100%. I’m not a fan, but it’s an okay vehicle."
938, a year ago,3,"Not a car gal. My employer has a fleet of Ford vehicles available to employees. I like that Ford  Fusion gets good mileage however I didn’t feel safe driving on the interstate. It’s an okay car, just not for me."
939, a year ago,5,"Great to drive with lots included as standard but also useful added extras. I have a top spec mod which is great, all gadgets included which all work perfectly. Being a Ford parts are also cheaper which is great for maintenance and I would buy again"
940,a year ago,4,"this car is really roomy and comfortable for people in the front and the back! i rode as a passenger in this vehicle and it was nice to ride in, i love the amount of room in this vehicle, overall i would say this is a good vehicle for anyone!"
941,a year ago,5,"I love my car, it’s every thing I need for a starter car. It comes with Bluetooth, an six cord, and the radio sound system is amazing. It drives really smooth. It’s also amazing in gas."
942, a year ago,5,The newer Ford fusions are quite luxurious inside. Good on gas and smooth ride. After using the touch screen there’s no going back to a radio dial. They are quite expensive if you buy brand new off the lot.
943,a year ago,5,"Me encanto mi vehículo, de todas maneras los reconomiendo los asientos son magníficos parece que estuvieran en la nubes, un carro último modelo vale la pena cómpralo yaaaaa no te arrepentirás enserioo"
944,a year ago,3,Pues casi siempre tiene problemas en la caja de velocidades y en el radio no me gustó la verdad pero eso no significa que no le guste a nadie
945, a year ago,3,I had a ford fusion right before i got my kia and it was a pretty decent car. I didnt seem to have much mechanical problems with it and I loved the heated leather seats.. I gave it 3 stars because the turning radius was HORRIBLE! Please be aware of this.. While pulling into tight spaces its very tricky!!
946, a year ago,5,"This was my mom’s car that I started to drive when I got my permit and I loved it. It had so much space, which was great to pack my team mates and our softball gear in every weekend."
947, a year ago,4,Over love my car!! Definitely recommend but wish they would handle business better when it comes to problems with the car itself! Very affordable lasts forever! I have a Ford Fusion! Ford Motor Company
948, a year ago,2,"I test drove an escape and I wasn't that impressed. I ended up purchasing a 2014 Nissan Rogue and do not regret it at all! The interior of the escape felt cramped and claustrophobic....the handling of the car also felt very cheap to me. My Rogue has the same size engine size as the escape and I felt as though I was driving a little 4 cylinder car when driving the escape. It had no get up and go. Also, I previously owned 2 Fords and they seem to have neverending problems after 70k miles. Also, my father bought a used Ford F150 FX4 Triton and only drove it when he wasn't using his company truck and the bottom rusted out of his truck so quickly that from one inspection to the next (so 1 year), the damage was basically irreversible without having to replace the entire chassi. Then come to find out it's a ""known"" problem of trucks between this year and that year. It rusted out the frame to the point it wouldn't pass inspection in 1 YEAR.....shouldn't that be a safety recall? Garbage......complete garbage......after seeing my Dad experience that financial garbage hole I will NEVER buy a Ford not will I ever recommend them!"
949, a year ago,1,"I had a Focus for 4 years and could not wait to purchase a new car. In 4 years of owning the car, I received notice of 6 major recalls. This was a brand new car when I purchased it. The transmission would also stutter every time the car started driving after being stopped at a light or stop sign. I would never recommend buying a ford."
950, a year ago,4,i had a ford f150 and i was a good truck could carry a lot good at towing alright in snow but im a toyota girl now 
951, a year ago,5,"I’ve had a Fusion Energi for a year now and I’m in love! I drove a Toyota my whole life and idk if I’ll ever go back. The MPGs, the benefits of driving a clean air car, and the comfort are unbelievable. My only complaint is that I unfortunately don’t get a chance to charge at home, if you go long enough without charging your battery the car completely shuts down and it’s a bit of a hassle to then unlock the car and essentially just start the car. It also messes with the settings too."
952, a year ago,4,Interior and exterior are nice but definitely could improve to be more futuristic. Spacious and would recommend for long drives affordable
953, a year ago,5,I have owned several fusions over the years and have never been disappointed! Very comfortable and roomy with amazing reliability! These cars have always satisfied my needs and exceeded my expectations! All in all I would recommend one of these vehicles to anyone!
954, a year ago,3,"Ok, I love my mustang. I purchased it salvaged and have an airbag recall. I took it to my local ford dealer and they did not want to fix it.  Other than that I absolutely love my 2008 Ford Mustang"
955, a year ago,3,3 stars why because for one I don’t really care for Ford vehicles but this particular vehicle wasn’t my favorite. It honestly was just alright but if your looking for an alright car give her spin.
956, a year ago,4,"This car is very comfortable, is really big. I would say that the bad thing about this car is I spent a. Lot of money on gas and on battery. One day I was driving when I realized that the car did not start again and the reason was that I did not have enough charge on the battery."
957, a year ago,4,This is my son's first car and it drives very smoothly in my opinion.  I like the leather interior of the car and all it's features especially the seat warmers.
958,a year ago,1,"I had a 2014 focus that ultimately was worth $500 after owning it for only 5 years due to so much mechanical failure. The automatic transmission was a complete nightmare and they are almost always on National backorder as everyone is having to replace them- It took over 6 months for me to get a new one, which then only lasted 80,000 miles before it physically would not move any longer. Worst car I’ve ever owned."
959, a year ago,4,"The F150 truck is pretty good on gas mileage, it is very efficient for work and for moving big furniture. What I would improve on it is how the vehicle looks like. I would say that it is affordable when it comes to parts and upgrading it."
960, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Ford Focus! it has everything i could possibly want in a car! Its reliable and has amazing gas mileage! I reccomend ford!
961,a year ago,4,I have 2017 Ford F150 King Ranch and I absolutely love it. Its lifted and sits up hight. Pretty god on gas and has not given ant troubles The dealership has been great with warranty and services.
962,a year ago,2,"Terrible gas & not worth the gadgets. Too many lights & distracting gadgets that are supposed to be “safety features”. I was spending $180 a week on gas and I was only going maybe 15 miles to work & back down the coast so not even that far to work. Worse car for a driving job, I switch to an 2004 Mazda that’s how much a hated this car, returned in the first month and wasn’t the car for me at all. Speed is great but what’s speed when it’s $70 to fill up. Toooooo expensive, go hybrid or electric only if you go Ford but try to avoid Fords all together. They make certain settings that only the Dealer can reset and it will cost you $150 to reset a setting you accidentally select on the dash, dumb."
963, a year ago,5,This is a nice affordable sedan that is very reliable. My cousin has driven hers for almost ten years and it’s still going strong! They don’t have alot of issues as with other Ford cars in the past.
964, a year ago,1,I hate this car is has a factory problem on the peeve valve and it doesn’t have a recall and the car is only 3 years old every time I go and put gas on it when I go to turn it on and shakes really bad and turns off and it takes a few time so it can turn and stay on I will never but this car again
965, a year ago,3,My friend has this car it's really cute gets good gas mileage and it will fly other than that I don't really know too much about them.. I just know when we go on vacation together that little thing will get up and go and we definitely make it there in a reasonable time without spending the whole lot on gas
966, a year ago,5,"I like for back in the day you wouldn't catch me driving a Ford to save my life because I had like Chevy but these day Chevy ain't worth the poop you throw on em. 
I drive a Ford F-150 extended cab and I absolutely love it I would most definitely recommend a truck"
967, a year ago,5,Muy bonito elegante familiar muy London por dentro lo recomiendo mucho y súper comodo
968, a year ago,4,"It is a nice car and it gets the job done. However I feel like their technology is lacking, I will say the model I have is a few years old but still feel it should be better. It gets good gas mileage which is a major plus and is a smaller SUV but also still super roomy. "
969, a year ago,5,"Mi esposa maneja una Ford scape 2014,
Es muy cómoda y con mucho espacio, es perfecta para la familia, cuando salimos a dar un paseo largo, no hay mejor opción que la scape, económica en el tema de la gasolina #scape#ford"
970, a year ago,4,Have had 2 generations 2003 and 2016. Great little suv. Holds alot of things especially  with 2 kids. EcoBoost engine has some power to it
971, a year ago,4,"Great little  car except for the 6 speed transmission  issues. Wishing it was a standard. Gets the kids and myself from point a to b. Have had a few over the years. 2001, 2005, 2008 and now 2012"
972, a year ago,3,It keeps tag in place. But you can of course find one the same without having to buy from Ford. I would improve this item by removing more of the bottom edge to see more of the tag. I wouldn’t recommend since they’re more different kinds and models.
973,a year ago,5,"Love my truck Great for winter I love that it is spacious
Cons are inherent with 6.0 but love the motor and the sound goes like a freight train and sounds like one too. Expensive unless you can fix it yourself"
974, a year ago,5,"I love my Fusion Hybrid! I get 31-34 miles per gallon.  It’s soooo quiet! Everybody always mentions they didn’t even realize it was on! I’ve had this car for two years so far and not a single issue! I travel a lot, so great gas mileage and dependability are very important to me!"
975,a year ago,3,This car was cute and easy to drive.  But it was an order car and broke down on me and wpuldnt make the diatance for needed travel
976,a year ago,3,Thus car was reliable and easy to drive.  However it tended to break down all the time.  It cost me a ton of money in repairs
977, a year ago,1,Worst vehicle I have ever owned. This thing is a piece of garbage. We struggle to get the check engine light off to even get it inspected. It was affordable but steer clear.
978, a year ago,5,"Very nice cars. Nice seating and leg room in the back seat, and nice storage in the trunk as well."
979, a year ago,3,"I have a love/hate relationship with my Ford. It works well when it wants to work. I had issues with my transmission that was under warranty, and it likes to reset (the display) quite a bit but it's amazing in the winter. With snow tires, this car is a little beast and I feel safe in it."
980, a year ago,3,Was not impressed by this car. Seemed bare bones and not comfy. It did however run like a champ. Took a beating and still kept chugging along.
981, a year ago,5,I’m going to court I really do it’s cheap affordable and it’s really comfortable in the inside and it’s just been a lot on it you don’t also how do you spent a lot on it give depends if you want to
982, a year ago,5,My mom has an escape and it’s a pretty solid car. she bought it brand new in 2018 and it’s a good one
983, a year ago,1,Hated this car but we were lucky to have the option to trade it for our 1st Kia Soul. The Ford had many issues including the passenger side door would fly open randomly while driving.  No room. Not comfortable at all.
984, a year ago,1,I had a Ford Tempo. So did a friend of mine. There is a reason people say that FORD stands for FIX AND REPAIR DAILY or FOUND ON the ROAD DEAD! The reason? .. They had a Tempo. The Ford Tempo is easily the worst car ever built on this earth! I was constantly having to repair this vehicle and it's not like I'm a race car driver or something! It would break down on Houston freeways with my step children in the car. I hated it. 
985, a year ago,1,"Car from hell. Transmission blew. Would go into cruise control without prompt. Had a 2011 brand new and traded a year later, devalued tremendously and sounded like it was going to fall apart"
986, a year ago,5,"Very nice, comfortable ride. The transmission is a bit weird in the 2015 model but it’s fine once you get used to it (it’s less concerning for someone who knows how to drive a manual transmission and understands that this car has some of the same qualities)."
987,a year ago,5,This is my 2nd focus now. They are reliable and easy to maintain and fix when required. As a young family it is good for all my needs.
988, a year ago,5,"I love my 2014 Ford Escape. It’s the perfect “entry level” SUV because it’s compact, but still has plenty of room. I’ve had mine for almost 4 years and haven’t had any problems."
989, a year ago,5,Great commuter car. Husband uses it to get to work. After a front end collision with a truck backing into it the horn nor the battery were never the same. Battery was a simple replace. Down side is right now on his year the hood sensor is setting off the car alarm. So make sure that is replaced it is a recall.
990, a year ago,3,"Not much of a ford fan. Everyone I've owned has left me stranded. Also, it's easy to burn up seals on this vehicle."
991,a year ago,5,"Love my car. Really spacious and comfortable, more reliable than other models I’ve had in the past. I think it looks great too (I have a 2014 model)"
992, a year ago,5,I love my escape! It fits my family of 4 so perfectly. I can’t say anything but good things about my suv
993,a year ago,3,This was a satisfying car. I loved the sleek sporty look and I had the v6 so their was plenty of power. The gas prices were great and trunk space was a plus the downside was after so many miles their was always something going bad on it we ended up replacing all wheel bearings and multiple issues with it but overall the car was worth it and amazing
994, a year ago,4,Not my best car but definitely a great one. Had for about 3 years now and I haven’t had no problems with it. It has enough space for a family of 5 preferably 4 and enough room in the back for all the shopping.
995, a year ago,5,I absolutely adore my car. I’ve had it since high school and have never looked back. It’s taken me across the country and has held up incredibly well. Plus the gas mileage can’t be beat.
996,a year ago,5,Love my Ford f 150. We have eco boost and must say I love having something that isn't small and has 4x4! I like the gas mileage I get with the eco boost. In my opinion I think they are priced right due to them lasting a long time. We also made sure to buy the body style that will not rust!
997, a year ago,5,"Very comfortable, smooth drive, and stylish too! Reliable to drive for daily use. Petrol lasts a decent amount of time"
998, a year ago,5,"Great car to learn in, but boring for an experienced driver unless you get an eco boost or ST/RS model."
999, a year ago,4,I had a 2005 Ford Focus. It was the most basic model. It was burgundy and never gave me any trouble. Small and inexpensive.
1000, a year ago,4,This was a fantastic first new car. It rode well and was comfortable. Still great without all the bells and whistles but I would say on the smaller size if you have kids or car seats.
1001, a year ago,5,This car made for a fantastic drive. It had a decent amount of room and fit two car seats comfortably.
1002, a year ago,5,Love my Ford Escape.  Descent gas mileage for a turbo.  Let’s of great features.  Comfortable rise for a small vehicle.  Lots of room in back for Costco runs and golf clubs.
1003, a year ago,3,Decent size crossover SUV. Handles well on the road. We’ve had some minor mechanical issues with the vehicle. It’s not big enough either for our growing family￼. I do like the vehicle however￼
1004, a year ago,4,"Very solid reliable car. It will always get you from a to b with very minimal issues. I’m you will always feel solid and firm on the road, especially in the winter. They have well équipes it with electronics inside to make it enjoyable and entertaining."
1005, a year ago,5,"If you’re looking for a car that will give you a quiet, smooth ride into the sunset, look no further. Great gas mileage and very affordable. This car is also great in the snow. Don’t let this car ESCAPE! Get it now!"
1006, a year ago,5,Mine was a hand-me down from my bestfriend. It’s a 2008 and it gets me where I need to go!
1007, a year ago,5,"I love este carro, súper como ahorra gasolina y es rápido. Ideal para un matrimonio es cómodo"
1008, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my Ford Escape! It has easily become my favorite car. It has plenty of room for family trips, going to the grocery store, or any kind of errand. It helps when moving your college kid from their apartment after graduation to their new residence. 😉"
1009, a year ago,5,"My family and I are very happy with our Ford Escape it’s perfect for our family of 5! It’s very comfortable, roomy and gas mileage is incredible! These vehicles are affordable I definitely recommend it"
1010, a year ago,4,Is such an economic car when it comes to grass  worth $20 i usually fill it up. It runs great for long drives.  I would improve it by making the panel a little bettet
1011, a year ago,5,My Daddy’s a Ford Guy so I’m of course a Ford Girl. Actually my Dad gave me my Escape. Drives smooth tells me if something is wrong with it. Great size price is well a little pricey not too bad. I would recommend
1012, a year ago,5,"What an amazing family car it is. We went to buy some other brand car but we didn't like it, as we sat in Ford escape we changed our mind. Although we were tight on budget but my husband said you take care of everyone in our home, lemme buy this car for you so you can enjoy going to your groceries haha. We bought it and after 4 years i can say my next car will be Ford as well. Ford Escape"
1013, a year ago,5,"Love the Ford Focus. Even at 5’10 I was comfortable driving. Great on gas, has a great take off and smooth breaks. This will most likely be my daughters first vehicle as they’re or expensive. Definitely recommend!!"
1014,a year ago,4,"Solid car. Very reliable, safe, comfortable, and convenient. Great daily commuter, and has a smooth drive. Great for a small family, or a young person. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a solid car. But for me I need something exciting and fun to drive everyday, and this is not that."
1015, a year ago,3,"It was ok, the quality of interior was fine but felt like car was falling apart while driving."
1016, a year ago,5,Love this truck. I like that I am off the ground and I don’t feel every bump in the road.
1017,a year ago,5,Great nippy car! Only has 5 gears but for a first car its an absolute beauty! Mine is red and looks very bold on the roads. I have a 3 door but is still brilliant
1018, a year ago,5,Love this car 🚗 it'd probably take care about the money gas keys light. How to accept it but I'm not sure what to do nothing at all and you know it giving me time 🙂 vkerr 8gooohbv huh giving 6vfugi 
1019, a year ago,5,My vehicle is to perfect for my life style from every day basis to family travling has enough space 5 seater with trunk space with spare availability ac funcionalitys seat warmers and sun roof. All in all perfect for me and my family
1020, a year ago,3,Nothing wrong with the car I just prefer SUV’s. I had this car as a rental and it is not made for car seats.
1021, a year ago,3,"I have a Ford Focus hatchback and it has been a reliable car, but not perfect. The size is ideal for me and my lifestyle, but it would be too small for many people. My main complaint is that I’ve had issues with the transmission. Sometimes the car will stutter when accelerating from a stop."
1022, a year ago,5,"This was my best friends car and she loved it. It did break down often, but fortunately she loved fixing it."
1023,a year ago,5,"I LOVE MY FORD ESCAPE! I can't believe that I have had it for almost 10 years and it is still in great condition with no major issues. I will not be getting rid of it anytime soon, unless I need to get a bigger car. It is so reliable and cute. I loveit!"
1024, a year ago,4,"I have va 2010 escape, it's a pretty decent car with minimal issues for it's age. I've only had it a few months though."
1025, a year ago,3,This is a Nice car but to small for my liking. Drives nice and has nice features but I just need something bigger
1026, a year ago,5,"I’ve had my suv for almost a year now, it’s so spacious especially when you have kids! Great to travel in. Well recommend"
1027, a year ago,3,My grandmother had this car and it sat pretty low but I wouldn’t say that’s a problem. The seat was pretty comfortable.
1028, a year ago,5,I love this car my aunt recently purchased this car and she loves it too. I love the seat heaters that are included in the front. The electric seat adjusters are another added bonus as well. I think this is a lovely car but is obviously pricey so It is definitely an investment
1029, a year ago,5,"I have driven a Ford for over 15 years. Started with a Ranger, then an Escape and now an Explorer. I have never been let down. They are reliable and dependable."
1030,a year ago,5,"The Escape is the perfect size SUV for me. Spacious, good gas mileage, and nice interior."
1031,a year ago,5,Has great gas mileage. Seating is very comfortable both passenger and back seat. I wouldn’t change a thing about this vehicle. Very affordable and works for every one. Totally recommend!
1032, a year ago,5,I love my fusion its a 2008 and I love driving it I don't wanna trade it in on another car I'm happy with it.i have 3 other vehicles but I prefer to drive the fusion
1033, a year ago,5,"Ford Motor Company I absolutely love my Ford explorer, it provides so much room for my three large dogs along with accessibility for three row seating, panoramic sunroof and paddle shifters. Out of all the SUVs that I've driven this is probably one of the fastest ones and upkeep  is minimal. I love my explorer more than anything!"
1034, a year ago,5,"We had a vehicle like this for a loaner while our vehicle was being worked on and my husband and I both loved it, maybe one day when we can afford something better we'll be able to purchase one of these."
1035, a year ago,5,"My husband and I just purchased this vehicle almost 2 months ago and it's been a great vehicle so far, I know that some people put Fords down but so far so good as long as its a safe and reliable vehicle for our family then its all good."
1036, a year ago,5,"I have a 2018 Ford Escape sport edition, and absolutely adore it. It suits me so well, and has everything I need. From my blacked out rims with magnetic gray paint, to the fabulous interior!"
1037, a year ago,4,I’ve never driven this car but I have ridden in a used one. It runs and drives fine. It has good gas mileage as well
1038, a year ago,5,"Great product to drive. It’s cheap on gas and has great hwy mileage. Also I have the sports edition one, so even better."
1039,a year ago,3,"I have this car in silver and I will say it’s a pretty amazing car but the only thing I hate about it is this model in particular, almost every Ford Focus owner would say the same thing about the clutch and how it makes this sound after every turn or after you accelerate until you get it fixed. Luckily mine is covered under warranty until 100,000 miles but after that I’m going to have to start paying if I want to get the sound fixed. It doesn’t damage the car whatsoever but that’s one of the reasons they discontinued this car. I have the 2015 model and that’s the model that really does it the most. I love the space this car has for how small it is and it’s very good on gas. I think it’s one of the cutest small cars out there and mine is all decorated on the inside with organizers and cute cup holder things and a trash can. The car itself is very sleek looking and does great in the snow (also I have good wheels and wipers and lights for it) overall I love my car and it’s perfect for road tripping as well!"
1040, a year ago,5,"I own a 2000 Ford F-150 which is the Triton V8. I've put 230,000 miles on it and the truck to this day still runs like a champ. As long as you change the oil change the filter change the air cleaner as said in the manual every 6 months or 3000 Miles whichever comes first this is an any vehicle your vehicle will last you a long time. Ford Motor Company is definitely the truck that I would go with."
1041, a year ago,2,"I didn’t like it very much. It drove well. It was clean. The brakes were kinda squishey. But the amount of recalls it had in the short time period I owned it. Made me feel unsafe driving in it.  The time I wasted waiting there. With kids. I’m busy, I got things to do are you paying me to sit in your waiting room."
1042, a year ago,5,I have a Ford Fusion hybrid and love it. It has treated me well over the past 6 years. I get great gas mileage but still have performance when I need it. I have had very few issues with the car beyond the normal wear and tear items and I have accumulated over 120k miles.
1043, a year ago,3,"Had a Ford Tempo, crown Victoria, and Drive my friend’s old type of Ford Focus. They always have something wrong with them and are not reliable. Although in the little four door Ford from the 90’s we slid in ice and raimed into a snow bank and divider and there was no damage to the car. This new Focus probably wouldn’t have the same outcome!!"
1044,a year ago,2,"Garbage car. Zero thrust, cheap interior, horrible gas mileage. Seriously, this is the reason why ford gets such a bad wrap for anything other than their trucks."
1045, a year ago,5,Hands down the best car out there. Ford focus are my favorite cars. They have a lot of get up to them and they are beautiful!
1046, a year ago,5,"I’ve had 2 Ford Focuses & absolutely love them! I like that they are small cars for the most part, but have plenty of room. I think they are really affordable and last a while. I would highly recommend"
1047, a year ago,5,Love this product! Worth the buy! You should try it if you haven’t! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
1048, a year ago,5,The appearance of the car is beautiful. The car handles better than any car I have ever owned. The drivers compartment is very comfortable.
1049, a year ago,4,"Good vehicle for winter driving, traction control, heated seats and a back wiper!  My sensors  have failed, the engine light and low tire sensor.  Has since been repaired and all is well.  Good SUV if you need to travel a lot!"
1050, a year ago,3,"The Ford Fusion are a good vehicle in particular the hybrid. The hybrid in particular is excellent on fuel and is very quite and quite comfortable as well. However, for a full-size car it is lower sitting than some may like."
1051, a year ago,4,Surprisingly roomy trunk! Comfortable reliable good gas mileage! Sometimes doesn’t start despite zero mechanicals issues reasonably priced
1052, a year ago,2,"Personally not a fan of the Ford escapes, they have a very distinct running sound that is simply die to the make of the vehicle. They are smaller for an intermediate suv. They aren’t the most comfortable for longer drives but they will fit four people."
1053, a year ago,3,The Ford Fiesta is definitely more spacious than you would assume for a smaller size car. It’s got some pep to it but runs quite loud and has fewer features and I would not carry more than three peoples in the vehicle.
1054,a year ago,5,"I love it, great gas mileage and really comfy ride. Love the fact that it’s quite too and pretty quick. Only problem is, I’m not driving it cause I’m writing this review"
1055, a year ago,5,Wasn't my first choice in vehicles but my husband insisted. But I love it . I usually only like big body's but the Fusion has definitely grown on me.
1056, a year ago,3,"it's ok  i was having issues with the transmission right after i bought it.  every time the car shifted, you could hear a grinding noise.   took it to dealer and of course they didn't hear anything.  now my motor is ticking.   it's only 3 years old!   i'm going to try kia next. see if i have better luck there"
1057, a year ago,5,"Absolutely loved this SUV. Would still have it if it wasn’t that we needed a stronger vehicle at the time for moving. Spacious, good on gas, no issues."
1058, a year ago,3,"Great car, very Good on gas. Easy to control and  manuever. Great is slick weather conditions. Has a good sized trunk for storage."
1059, a year ago,3,"It's a great starter car, or for someone on a budget. It is great on gas and for the small size has surprisingly alot of room for storage and passengers"
1060, a year ago,5,"Great car, I used in it a trip, so I rented it! It was great on gas, had lots of space and was user friendly!!  I could see myself getting one of these if I needed a new car! If your looking for a new car, this would be a good one!"
1061, a year ago,5,Amazing car! I honestly pick it over my mustang half the time. So comfortable. You cannot beat Ford in thier reliability and comfort!
1062, a year ago,3,"Drives pretty well and it seems to be pretty reliable, however it doesn't do well at all in the snow and I love in Colorado so that's not a good fit."
1063,a year ago,4,I loved this car so much! I even got emotional when we traded it in for a bigger suv. Pros economic and sleek. Cons small back seat and it has a small trunk. Very good for a single person or a couple. I do not recomend for families with more than one child.
1064, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Fiesta! My brother works at Ford and allowed me to get a discount. The only thing I would change would be that sometimes the sync on my car does glitch
1065, a year ago,5,Easy to drive and handles great. Great fuel economy. Sticks to the road. Easy to maintain and use. Car drives like on a cloud.
1066,a year ago,5,"I had a 2009 Ford Fusion for 7 years. Loved every minute of driving that car! It was a great vehicle, held up well (only a little bit of rust spots started on the roof line by the Windshield appeared in 2020). The newer models are very slick looking (almost like a DB8)"
1067, a year ago,5,"Really enjoyed this car. It was my mom’s, but I did get to drive it when I was learning to drive. Drives really well. Not too big of a car. Backseat has a lot of leg room, and the open back was really convenient for grabbing snacks on road trips."
1068, a year ago,5,Great American auto company! We don’t buy or drive any other brand. Ford is all about quality and safety. I trust this company.
1069,a year ago,3,It’s ok not my fav I prefer my truckFord Escape pros are that it is a nice smooth ride. The radio isn’t great. The back seats recline which my friends like
1070, a year ago,5,"Been a passenger in this. I love sitting in this car as a passenger bc you are high up and can see everything. It drives smooth and it is a very roomy car. So that if you were going on a long trip, you can sit back and relax and feel so comfortable."
1071, a year ago,5,"I have a 2011 that still runs like a champ. Gets about 32mpg still and shes been through a lot of driving. Small, but more room than the Fiesta (which i almost bought before I decided on the focus). Mine had a truck, but even the hatchbacks have their own upsides."
1072, a year ago,5,"I have a 2014 and I love her. She's comfortable, the drive is smooth, and she cuts through snow like butter. I feel very safe in it in all weather. Its roomy and reliable. I have the titanium edition, so of course having heated seats it always a plus(I live in Michigan). However, tires are expensive. Thats all I can say about that."
1073, a year ago,5,Un coche bastante cómodo y muy intuitivo para manejar todos los extras que lleva. Me gusta mucho!
1074, a year ago,3,"Nice car it’s really comfortable. Love the fact that is has so much space. I don’t like the fact that It has ugly rims but I highly recommend this car.  
# Ford"
1075, a year ago,5,Lo que vello modelo me encantaría tener uno igual esta maravilloso y tener el gusto de salir a dar una vuelta
1076, a year ago,5,Que vello me encanta el color su estilo para salir a pasear con la familia a cualquier parte de la ciudad y a las afueras
1077, a year ago,5,Great car. My husband drives one as his commuter car. Fuel mileage is great and handles well in winter for being a tiny car.
1078, a year ago,4,"I have a 2011 Fiesta. It’s good on gas and mileage, but I’ve had transmission issues- had to replace a part. I’m the second owner of the car. Get oil changed and maintained regularly. I love how small the car is, makes it a lot easier to fit in parking spots. It was important to me that my car had good heat as I live in New England; my little fiesta doesn’t disappoint."
1079,a year ago,5,I go to Taylor Ford in Michigan and I love the people there. Outta all the place's I've gotten a car at Taylor Ford is the only one who gave a price and by the time I was done with everything it was still the price quoted to me....
1080, a year ago,5,"These are pretty roomy. I worked for ford motors so I actually got to drive several of their vehicles. They’re pretty economical on gas, with some work you can definitely find one at a decent price. The newer models come with some awesome packaging and technology."
1081, a year ago,1,"Where do I start!!!!!
This vehicle is just problems!!!!!
I’ve owned my vehicle for 3 years and I’ve had the transmission replacement and worked on 5 times. I wouldn’t recommend this vehicle to anyone. Ford really messed up when they build this line of vehicles."
1082,a year ago,5,"This was my cousin’s first car, he bought a blue one! It was very nice, pretty comfy"
1083, a year ago,5,"I love the focus! The car drives well, is very safe for a baby. The only dislike is how much you have to put up the seat to fit a car seat."
1084, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford vehicle! This is the 3rd one I've owned and my first one I was in a car accident in with myself and 5 other people and when I say that we were protected due to a great vehicle... we were all safe and sound with only two of us with minor injuries. Its also a great family vehicle for traveling alone or with the family, for sports mom/dads too."
1085, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Fusion. I bought my car used in 2014 (it’s a 2012) and it’s been going strong since. I’ve traveled multiple 24+ hour road trips with it and no issues. I’m dreading the day it finally breaks down and I have to get a new vehicle.
1086, a year ago,5,This is the car my mom has and the car that I learned to drive in. It is super comfortable and easy to drive. The seats are comfortable and the back seat is spacious! Definitely worth the price :)
1087, a year ago,5,"I love this car! It is so comfortable and easy to drive. It has enough power that you don’t have to try too hard to get up to speed. Unfortunately, seats tend to be a little narrow in the hips. This doesn’t detract much from how comfortable it is. This car is reasonably priced, and long lasting."
1088, a year ago,4,This is a nice small suv.  I’m not a big Ford fan but it has nice amenities and the all wheel drive too.  I hate the noises that Fords make and the radio is hard to navigate.
1089, a year ago,5,"I’ve owned two Ford escapes, a 2013 and a 2015. Both have been great cars, the 2015 was definitely an upgrade."
1090, a year ago,4,Great first car. I have a 2012 Ford Fiesta and have yet to find anything which reveals its age. It drives smooth and I feel completely safe when driving it. The only downside is that it is not very fast at all! Ford Fiesta
1091, a year ago,4,"My introduction to Ford Focus was a rental car. I was impressed by the instrument layout. Everything I needed to know was a glance away. The engine showed some pep when I needed to merge or change lanes. Gas mileage was a bonus!When I replace my current car, I will definitely visit a Ford dealer to test drive the current model Focus."
1092, a year ago,3,"Great car, not so comfortable seats in the back though. Love the size and shape of it. and trunk space. good on gas mileage"
1093, a year ago,3,I don’t find this cad drives good in the winter which is very important for where I live
1094, a year ago,5,Para mi pareces es muy auto quisiera comprarlo en un futuro para probarlo tengo varios conocidos que si lo tienen y la verdad osea a mi me gusta el modelo en siempre y se ve que de lejos es muy comodo y eso la verdad para mi hija seria fantastico y igual a mi familia
1095, a year ago,5,"Love love love my Ford Fusion!! Very dependable!! Seat are comfortable, and car is very spacious."
1096,a year ago,4,"While it was small, it was comfortable. They definitely handle and ride more like a truck though. Perfect for a family with one to two children."
1097, a year ago,5,I have never had any issues with Ford in all my time owning my Mustang GT. They have always been quick to help me or answer any of my needs. Always super friendly staff that is eager to help!
1098, a year ago,5,"I love my husbands truck. It's a super cab and really comfortable for long drives. It has the short bed, so parking is easier in congested areas. When there was a recall the issue was immediately addressed and fixed."
1099, a year ago,4,My Ford Escape hasn’t given me any crazy expensive issues since I’ve purchased. It’s been an overall satisfying experience. Its not expensive in terms of having to go to the shop constantly but gas can get pretty expensive. #Ford Escape.
1100, a year ago,5,"I've had a few older Fords and what I like is that if something breaks down, its not expensive to fix. My boyfriend just fixes everything instead of bringing it to a shop. I've only ever had used ones that have been cheap. I recommend these vehicles they last forever."
1101, a year ago,4,"I like the Ford line of sedans. I think Ford is competitive in its line of economy cars. I also own a Ford F450 diesel and it’s a great, reliable truck."
1102, a year ago,5,Great little car to tote around in.  Very fuel efficient.  We bought a 2011 for our daughter and she has done very well as a first time driver in this vehicle.  Lots of great features and extras and all easy to use and figure out.  You can park this baby just about anywhere and fit.  
1103, a year ago,5,"Lovely and comfortable car, has a big trunk so you can carry as many staff as you need it’s perfect for a family with kids"
1104, a year ago,4,Well my brother has a Ford Focus and he's let me drive it a few times but it's a car I'm used to driving an SUV now so I probably would not buy a car ever again but it rides real nice it's roomy feels like you're driving in a Cadillac you know no bumps when you're going and it also has heated seats and heated steering wheel and heated mirrors slept great something that we need up here in New York in the winter
1105, a year ago,5,So 10 years ago I bought a 1999 Ford Explorer Sport 4 wheel drive sunroof heated seats air conditioning great stereo system and it ran like a top for about 6 months from that point on I had to started out in low one and then push it up to drive to Stratton and it was fine I couldn't afford to get it fixed at the time transmission work was very expensive but I would definitely buy another one if I could get that year make and model
1106,a year ago,5,"It’s a confortable car, it’s very nice to drive a car ad this one , it’s a perfect car for parking it’s easy,.... wow"
1107,a year ago,3,I really like my car it’s super fun to drive. It doesn’t have a temperature gauge which is kinda weird. It’s good on gas and drives smooth.
1108, a year ago,5,"Es un excelente auto, me gusta muchísimo tiene una excelente potencia y es muy confortable Ford Focus"
1109,a year ago,3,I owed a 2012 Ford Focus. I loved the gas mileage and smooth maneuverability. It’s a very compact car with not much room on the inside. It can be a fairly affordable car. I would recommend to someone needing a fuel efficient vehicle.
1110, a year ago,4,Lots of features for the price. Safe and reliable. Roomy interior without the driving a bus feeling. Sync can be tricky but is mostly easy to use
1111, a year ago,3,Reliable car. Not a whole lot of room to load things in but gets great milage. It also comes in a lot of really pretty colors
1112, a year ago,2,"A very affordable vehicle, however, this also means there is a lack of quality. The carpet through out the vehicle is poor quality making it extremely difficult to vacuume. Poor acceleration, however, this is attributed to the engine size. Seats are quite comfortable given the price of vehicle."
1113, a year ago,5,It's a great car I dont own one but my cousins always take me out in this and it relaxing comfy and amazing car for long drives. I love to go out with my relatives show up at my door in their car. It wasn't too expensive it was affordable and I recommend this car
1114,a year ago,2,Car gets us from A to B but isn’t my preference of vehicles. It has very small space inside the car and boot space is horrendously small. Only thing I like is that it is an easy car to drive. It doesn’t have much power for a 1.5L TDCI so I would love something more powerful next time.
1115, a year ago,4,I love the look of my car 100%! It drives like a dream for the most part...only thing that drives me nuts is that my transmission keeps having problems and my car is just barely 5 years old. I used my warranty to rebuild my transmission and replace the clutch a few times and feel I'll have to do it again sooner than later. Other than that I love my car!
1116, a year ago,3,"I found this to be a very basic vehicle, and it blends in with a lot of other cars, which may be why I got lost in the parking lot, lol!"
1117, a year ago,5,"10/10 excelente automóvil, muy cómodo y espacioso, tienes muchas herramientas geniales, sus asientos son muy cómodos y muy fácil de manejar."
1118, a year ago,3,"He is very good, but he was co-pilot, I can only say that his style and design is very beautiful and comfortable, he has good speed and excellent sound equipment"
1119, a year ago,4,"I own a 2017 Ford Escape Titanium. I bought this car because it offered vertically challenged me, great power settings, so that I have excellent visibility in traffic.
I also bought this car for the solid mileage, which was misrepresented by the window sticker, and online reviews.  My next car will be a hybrid or electric; I drive to work and back daily, and will look for a compact suv just for the seat height. Who knows, maybe I will end up in a Jeep? I just need the height."
1120, a year ago,5,"I loved my Ford Escape. A lot of space, very good gadgets but too big for me. Also the spare parts are very easy to find which makes maintenance more accessible!"
1121, a year ago,5,I owned a Ford and absolutely loved it! It was my first car! It got me around and honestly I would get another one
1122,a year ago,5,This is a smaller version of SUV than I’m used to but I did like it. The cons for the one we were in was that we would need a 3rd row seating. I believe it it quite affordable for its class range. I would recommend this for a smaller family.
1123, a year ago,5,"I really liked this vehicle, it made me feel it was safe to have my son in the vehicle . There are no cons for me, I just wish it looked a little sportier. It was very affordable for me and I'm a single mother. I do recommend this vehicle, especially for a first time buyer."
1124, a year ago,5,This thing is great as a family vehicle and also we more recently began using it as a work vehicle. The things my boyfriend has been able to haul on this suv is crazy. It has alot of power and it is great in the snow too.
1125,a year ago,4,"I have had three Escape's. Overall a great vehicle to own/lease. I love the size, although my next Ford I am upgrading. I have a 2019 and the interior is wonderful. I have seen a 2020 and they have gone backwards in the interior and exterior look. The gas mileage could be a bit better. Is a great vehicle for value."
1126, a year ago,3,The look is great. They do very well to get you where you need to be. Great on gas. However once something goes out it tends to stay that way from that point on! You have to maintenance these 24/7 or they turn into a piece of crap. Automatic transmission just forget it. You'll be out wayyyyy too much money. Invest else where don't believe me ask your local mechanics or a friend who's had one!
1127, a year ago,5,I bought my mom a 2016 Ford Escape and that car has been everything. I feel great knowing she has comfortable and safe everyday!
1128, a year ago,5,I had the hybrid fusion and absolutely loved everything about it! The leather seats hugged you and the gas mileage was outstanding!
1129, a year ago,3,This was my car that my company gave me to drive. I was not the biggest fan of it! I have never been a fan of Ford. It definitely is a nice small compact car! Definitely affordable!
1130,a year ago,5,Me gusta porque es blanco y donito color de 🚘 🚘 me gusta los carro a 👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓👓
1131,a year ago,4,"I really like my Ford Fusion. Its a decent size for my needs, gets decent gas mileage and drives well. I like the look of the vehicle as well."
1132, a year ago,5,"Questa macchina è una delle migliori che abbia mai guidato,molto confortevole negli spazi,gli interni si presentano molto curati,consuma veramente poco e come estetica mi ha colpito perché è davvero molto bella"
1133, a year ago,5,Roomy car. Great gas mileage. Was a rental in Las Vegas and I enjoyed driving this car. Fast exceleration. The seating was comfortable. Plenty of leg room for both front seat and back seat passengers. Group of 5 fit comfortably in the Ford Fusion. 
1134, a year ago,2,"Lemon for a car . So many recalls and I’ve had so many problems , I had to get a new vehicle within 3 years of having my escape"
1135, a year ago,5,"Have 3 Fords now and love them all. Always perform at such a great level, always great aftermarket stuff you can do to them. Super reliable vehicle and they are affordable for what brand they are. Safe for the whole family and so many choices of vehicles!"
1136,a year ago,5,I had my Ford Escape for over 10 years. I LOVED this car and was so sad when she finally died. I had a 2001 and I preferred the older model than the new version. Great storage space for whatever you might need. Comfortable back seat. Would definitely recommend for someone looking for a small SUV.
1137,a year ago,4,"We love our little Ford Focus. It was a great price point and gets good gas mileage for my husband commuting. It has great storage space. The backseat is very small though. We have 2 car seats and the front seats have to be moved very far forward to accommodate them. Great commuter car, not great family car."
1138, a year ago,5,Thouhgt it was a great vehicle for the price! My aunt had one for several years and it lasted amazingly! She hardly had any issues until it was about 15 years old.
1139, a year ago,5,This is my mother’s car but I do drive her occasionally and I love this car. This is her second Escape and I liked her old one better. It sat on a truck chassis and I felt like it was much more comfortable than this one. But the ride is nice and the extras on the vehicle are super nice as well!!!
1140, a year ago,1,Not a good car at all. 2014-2016 have really bad transmission issues and they need a lot of maintenance. Do not recommend
1141, a year ago,5,"I’ve owned two of these and let me say I’d buy another if Ford still made them. I currently own the 2016 SE AWD model and have never been more impressed. The tech is modern, it drives beautifully, and the engine holds just enough power for me. Excellent car!"
1142, a year ago,3,"This was my first ever new purchase. Had 7 miles on it. 2019 Ford escape. 
I hate it. 
I've replaced so many things in the last year on this car. Some that weren't covered by warranty either. 
Its cheaply made. Super uncomfortable. The backseat is not kid friendly. Almost impossible for a kid to buckle themselves in. Can't fit more than a car seat and booster without it being a squeeze. Wouldn't buy again. The ford edge though. That things cool."
1143, a year ago,3,"My escape has been decently reliable car for me over the past 4 years. There have been a couple of issues that have been frustrating, including an over-heating issue that would force me to get my car towed to a shop to get fixed. This and a couple of other issues will probably make me switch to a Toyota or a Subaru for my next car."
1144, a year ago,5,"Love this car. It rides great, the kids fit ok, wish it had a bigger trunk. It fits the basic needs and is super safe."
1145, a year ago,5,I rented one of these a few months ago to make a 12 hour round trip it had enough room for the kids and got great gas mileage loved it
1146, a year ago,5,I rented this car a while back and it was super nice had eco boost and got great gas mileage
1147,a year ago,4,It’s really comfortable and we don’t use much gas for the car is so affordable. The car is so nice and practical to use
1148, a year ago,5,"Absolutely,  love my 2005 GT Convertible Ford Mustang. Never a dull moment when heads keep turning when you drop the top and just cruise around your town."
1149, a year ago,4,Great car especially for families! Spacious and reliable! We’ve never had any issues with our escape and feel safe with our 2 young kids in it!
1150, a year ago,5,I loved my Ford Escape I think they are@great and my son loved the third row. I had an old model and it lasted me a long time. I think they are quality vehicles.
1151, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape, such a great style and midsize family car for us. We fit all four of us in there and have room for our supplies in the back. The gas mileage is amazing and it is our go to road trip car!"
1152, a year ago,5,"Me encanta mi carro manejo super agusto, moderno aunque es de años pasados me encanta por dentro y por fuero ya que a pesar de los años sigue siendo moderno"
1153, a year ago,5,"It is a super good car, a comfortable car, a car with a lot of spas, is very expensive in gas. I really liked those cars, they are very durable 
every woman with children should have a car like this too beautiful"
1154,a year ago,5,"It is a very small and compact car, for anyone that is on the smaller side it was perfect. It was also a car that was good for the economy. The insurance for the car was too expensive I will say that but all in all the car was great. I had no problems with the car and if I could purchase it again I would!"
1155,a year ago,5,"It has a very beautiful color, it is very striking, the car is very beautiful, the chairs are very comfortable, I would like to have this product"
1156, a year ago,5,Both my girls have Fusions and I love them. They are nice to drive and have a lot of room
1157, a year ago,5,My friend has a Ford Escape. I really like it. Roomy but not a huge SUV.  I do like a smaller size in a sport utility.
1158, a year ago,5,"I can’t think of anything bad about it. It certainly wasn’t made for a family of 8, so we did have to get a suburban. I like the backup camera and the lines to help you park. I like the other amenities that are included. I did get to drive it and it’s a small suv, but thats what I liked about it. I like to drive an suv without feeling like I am driving an suv."
1159,a year ago,5,"Great car, has everything you could need in a car all while getting great gas mileage for an SUV and being safe"
1160, a year ago,5,Great mileage. I love how campy and sporty this car is. Loved this car. Would purchase another one.
1161,a year ago,3,"In truth, the focus was not to my liking because there is a lot of noise from outside and also from the wheel bearings, otherwise everything is fine, good comfortable design but if I should put more airbags and better feel of  security tend to get stuck regularly"
1162,a year ago,5,"a very comfortable sedan has all the accessories close by i have no need to move a lot a smooth and safe driving, fuel saving, safe and efficient"
1163, a year ago,5,"It is a super car, which is too elegant and beautiful, I would like you to use it and learn more about the brand and models"
1164, a year ago,4,Was so smooth i didn't feel like i was really going on a road . A nice car to own . Everything is great in that car.
1165, a year ago,2,The speakers aren't the best. The seat covers are hard to wash if stained. Its very sturdy but its honestly not my taste.
1166, a year ago,3,Bought a brand new Ford Fusion back in 2008.  We slapped a trailer hitch on the back of that thing and hauled a full U-Haul from Missouri to Texas three times.  Never had a maintenance problem at all.  Good car.
1167, a year ago,5,This is my grandfathers car so it’s only still around because of that! It has definitely gotten its use out of it and has been an excellent source of transportation for my family and to and from work!
1168, a year ago,5,"Lo mejor de.   Lo mejor, el forfi to ciclado, os va a cundir la vida. Muy recomendable la berdad"
1169, a year ago,5,"I love my 2011 Ford Escape! Small, compact SUV but still spacious! I drive this daily: back and forth to work, kids to daycare, sports events and more! Plenty of space in the truck for EVERYTHING! Room in between the lids car seats. I bought mine used in 2015. Pricing is still great! I have had 2 accidents: once when an 18-wheeler hit me in the side rear and once from the front. Both accidents where repairable and did not cause any injuries. The impact wasn’t bad at all. I love my Ford and will stay a Ford customer."
1170, a year ago,5,"I loved my Ford Fusion, it was such a comfy car and I love my sun roof. I don’t think I’d improve anything.. it was very affordable for me. I would recommend this car to anyone"
1171,a year ago,4,"As long as you are safe, you can travel by car in peace and travel for miles. 
The interiors are very nice and neat"
1172, a year ago,5,"Full sized car with amazing gas mileage. The trunk is huge and can hold all of your stuff. Comfortable to drive, even on long car rides. Enabled with Apple Car Play to allow for easy, hands-free use of texting, calling, GPS, music and more. Would recommend"
1173, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my car. I delivery food so i drive all day sometimes and i spend almost nothing in gas. I love this because is economic. Ans very comfortable to sit and drive. I love that is jog a huge car. I even bought another one for my son.
1174,a year ago,5,"I love this car. I think it gives you the best value for your money. It is reliable, easy to drive, economical, but also fun. Moreover, it includes features that none of its competitors offer for the same price."
1175, a year ago,5,I have my car for four years now I have yet to have any major issues with it it’s been doing me just fine and I love it￼
1176, a year ago,5,"Great on the snow and ice, rides smoothly and gets to and from safely. Pros is that it’s great in the winter months cons it does go through the gas. It is affordable and I would recommend it for anyone that’s needs a good winter vehicle."
1177, a year ago,1,"Ford cougar.. when working their a nice car, comfy to drive in with great lumbar support though they have many many many issues I can’t say what exactly as the Ford company can’t seem to find the issue exactly but they have given my mum some money for the car being I guess faulty is the right word?"
1178, a year ago,5,"I loved my Escape when I had it. It was very stylish, but comfortable enough for weekly use. I loved the color red too. My payments were also very affordable and my local Ford dealership was so helpful and patient with my 88572849 questions. I wound up downsizing to an EcoSport and love that too!"
1179, a year ago,1,I would never own a car this small. My sister owned one and it's just too small and compact for my liking. Too low to the ground
1180, a year ago,5,These are pretty nice and roomy mid range vehicles. They are comfortable to ride and drive but after a few years they start having some issues that seem to be common between them. Resell value seems to hold well on the used market. Overall I could recommend certain years but not  all. I'd do my research on which years have the most issues before I did.
1181,a year ago,5,"This is my Grand father car, i love the site, It seem they hug you. Love the nice shape, elegant but perfect for the city"
1182, a year ago,3,This was my first car after the Chevy Tracker.  I had this car for about ten years before buying a new car.
1183, a year ago,5,I unfortunately had some issues with my car and this car was given as a rental until my vehicle was fixed!! I never wanted to give it back! I almost kept it and traded it for my other car! It drives so well and all of the features are awesome!
1184,a year ago,5,I have had this car for 6-7 years now and I love it! It’s very reliable and has a ton of room! Gets great gas mileage and drives very smooth!
1185, a year ago,4,I love my Focus! It's an older model but it has really held up well! I'm so impressed with the way ford built this car! It is so dependable.  Even given its age it's only needed minor repairs that were expected.
1186, a year ago,4,My wife and I bought a Ford Focus 2012 hatchback. We didn’t plan on buying a Ford but it was the right price and had the features we wanted. The back has a lot of room for storage when we put the back seats down. So we have hauled quite a few things with no problem. The transmission has had a few issues because that year had a new design. Other than than it’s been a pretty good car. We will buy a Subaru next because they get better ratings and resale values.
1187,a year ago,5,Smooth ride and so nice and quiet. Comfortable backseat for my kiddo. We spend a lot of time in the car going back and forth to appointments.
1188, a year ago,4,Love my Ford Focus. My model is from 2014 but it's honestly the beat car for a young driver! It's great with gas and super reliable and can last year years!
1189, a year ago,5,"Used this car as a rental when our truck had issues. This car was qhick, quiet, and very spacious. The trunk is pretty big and the features are awesome."
1190, a year ago,4,"We got a 2013 f150 svt. We already had to have part of the engine redone (it took 3 months for the ford dealership to finish...and the truck was under 120,000 miles). Its a nice truck..but that wasnt good."
1191, a year ago,4,"I prefer small vehicles so this was too big for me. Blind spots were a little difficult to check. Overall it’s a comfortable and pleasant ride, but definitely a better fit for someone with kids or who prefers larger vehicles."
1192,a year ago,3,I love my car it is roomy but its down at the moment so not on my good list for most part it does well getting me around
1193, a year ago,5,"El Mejor auto que he tenido me encanta el ford fiesta es espacioso, cómodo y toda la familia viaja a gusto dentro de él. Es muy lindo y no da problemas es muy bueno."
1194, a year ago,5,I really enjoy being a passenger in these vehicles but I don’t like them for myself. There isn’t enough room for me
1195, a year ago,2,Probably the worst car I ever owned! So many mechanical issues! A local Ford dealership had my car for over a month trying to fix the issue and couldn’t 🙃 I was the 2nd owner and the vehicle only had about 40K miles on it before it started going downhill.
1196, a year ago,5,"This car ride amazing! Even being a Chevy fan, I’d say this takes the cake! It rides amazing and I couldn’t believe how comfortable the thing was!"
1197, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Focus fusion hybrid. It is hands down the quietest smoothest car that I have ever driven. For as long as I have had it it has not given me any issue and the steering is nice and smooth.
1198, a year ago,5,Our Ford fusion is my FAVORITE. we have a 2010 and it is the luxury version. I fell in love immediately.  The next thing I want is a 2020 Ford fusion.  we have the SEL AWD and thats what im getting next too. They never let you down! And not to mention the stock radio bangs! Which is wild.  I always forget we don't have a system and I'm like dang! Bass hits hard.
1199, a year ago,5,"Ford is the best, always has been and always will be. Our Ford fusion was amazing, we loved it and it never let us down. Any of fords fusions, focus, or taurus are all my favorites when it comes to daily drivers. Our current is a fusion which is what replaced our focus."
1200, a year ago,1,Es un buen carro no lo tengo jajajaja pero debe de ser muy caro por ser modelos reciente  pero ve que es bueno 😂
1201, a year ago,4,"Good car! Great on gas, and a great first car! Ford in general manufactures  a range of cars that are super economical and very trendy!"
1202, a year ago,5,"Super smooth and light, great as a first car and good on gas. Definitely an economical choice, both affordable and compact."
1203, a year ago,3,"My household has owned 4 ford focus models.  The first was a 2003 zx3, the clutch plate broke at 35,988 miles and was not covered by warranty.  Traded for a 2005 Mustang that the electric system went haywire at 70,000 miles. 
The second was a 2005 focus 2dr hatchback that my daughter had as a first car. She treated it like a little bumper car. I went with her to sign over papers so she could buy her first new car. The 3rd, a 2014 4dr hatchback with no issues this far...thank God!  The 4th and final focus was a 4dr sedan that the electrical system was screwy, the dealer wouldnt repair, and now it wont run."
1204,a year ago,5,"Good car, Ford Expedition runs great all@pros and then only con I can think of I’d the gas mileage since it’s a big car"
1205, a year ago,3,Great on gas but not much for space. The handling is ok but feels kinda slow for the motor in it.
1206, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Escape I’ve owed a 2002 till this year my grandson got his license I’m this car I just got rid of it gave to to someone it’s probably still has another couple of years left hated to see it go I love this product it’s been the best car I’ve ever owed
1207, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my car! I have a 2019 Fusion Hybrid and can't say enough great things about it! From the almost silent ride (besides my music...which sounds great 😉) to the great gas mileage. I love how the navigation because I drive a lot for work and how all my messages are read to me to encourage safe driving but stills allows for me to get all important messages immediately. I love how just about everything is centered around safety and comfortable...and keeping the environment safe too!
1208, a year ago,4,"Pro: Ottimi consumi, buon designe ed estetica, interni comodi, jack aux, spaziosa

Contro: Rumorosa, poggiatesta sedili anteriori scomodo.

Non riscontro altri fattori negativi per quanto concerne il mio parere personale.Ford"
1209,a year ago,4,"I love my 2010 focus. It’s lasted me a good while, just hit 150,000 miles. I will say it recently has started needing a lot of work. Little things add up. A wheel baring here, a this there. It doesn’t drive as tight as it used to, and now shakes if I get it on the interstate. However, it’s lasted well and I payed a good price for it originally. It is very low to the ground, but I’ve taken it on many many cross country and back road trips. It’s my little trusty wagon. Also I will say the value severely drops on these. I’ve been thinking about getting an suv, or maybe a Jeep, I took it in to see what my trade in value was: 600$. Like seriously it made me so mad. She’s worth way more to me then that. So I’ll drive her until I can’t anymore. Great gas mileage, small backseat room but big trunk space. Not any major issues, just regular age stuff."
1210, a year ago,5,My girlfriend owns this vehicle and it is a great small SUV. It is a great in between vehicle. Bigger than the average car but smaller than the large SUV with all the same comforts.
1211, a year ago,4,"A nice drive , don’t like the 2015 ones that look like the cop cars 💩 I like the white color"
1212, a year ago,3,"muy comodo y agradable a su vez, confiable no presenta inconvenientes su aire acondicionando es un auto super bueno"
1213, a year ago,3,"I’ve have this Ford Focus for more than 15 years or longer.  I’ve kept the maintenance on this car on a regular basis, any problems that arose, I made sure to have it fixed, replaced the brakes before encountering problems with the Rotors, which would have been a huge cost.  I had the muffler replaced, which didn’t cost me too much.  Any/all vehicles I’ve owned I made sure maintenance was kept up, but I also made sure my mechanic looked for any other problems, so I could address any potential problems. Immediately, which helped me to minimize my out-o-pocket expenses.  I would recommend a Ford Focus to anyone."
1214, a year ago,5,Absolutely  in love! Easy to drive and comfortable as well. I’m getting 35+ miles to the gallon driving in hybrid mode. Usually fill my tank once a month!
1215, a year ago,5,Drove well. Was a friends car. I am not really a big Ford fan myself but her car was really nice.
1216, a year ago,1,Not a fan at all. Every minute there is something else that needs to be fixed. Not comfortable as a passenger or driver.
1217, a year ago,5,"Smooth ride, roomy, sound system is pretty decent. Also feels very safe. The model I rode in had leather seats and the heated seats are great."
1218,a year ago,4,Owned a 2013 focus turbocharged features were nice and it was a fun car but the transmissions are known to be unreliable
1219, a year ago,4,"This is a great SUV/Crossover. It's bigger than the average crossover, but smaller than a lot of SUVs. It has good fuel efficiency I love the rearview camera and the warning system that comes on when reversing. There is tons of leg room and trunk space, perfect for road trips and long car rides! Great car!"
1220, a year ago,5,"I drove my 2010 fusion to over 200,000 miles and it was still running beautifully. I had a luxury model with heated seats and a sunroof. Towards the end of its life the sunroof failed but that was the only issue I had!"
1221, a year ago,5,This was a great first car and unfortunately I had a bad accident in it and hit the median on the high way. I came out with barley a scratch. This vehicle is as safe as you could ask for for a first car.
1222, a year ago,3,This car is cute but far to small I'm 5'9 I had no leg room plus the kids were crammed in the back seat but the awesome features made it worth it 
1223, a year ago,5,Yup Im a passenger in this Ford Fusion and I can’t say anything bad about this car it’s amazing on gas.
1224, a year ago,5,"My mom bought her ford focus in 2007 and still has it! Its a good little car that last a long time if you take care of it. Always keep up on oil changes and fluids or you will regret it! Its affordable and dependable for the most part! Nothing really fancy about it, good commuter car"
1225, a year ago,5,My car has been a blessing to me. I love that I chose this particular vehicle. It is not too large or too small.
1226, a year ago,5,"As a passenger and occasional driver of an F-150, I really like it. You can fit so much into the back of the cab and in the bed of it. Besides utility, it is such a comfortable car to drive in and has a super smooth ride. Highly suggest it to anyone needing to haul things around or take long drives with a lot of cargo."
1227, a year ago,3,"I like Ford trucks and my husband has a f150 but the escape is not what I would consider a family suv, my husband is 6’2” and there isn’t any room in the back seats for the kids to be comfortable. They are having to move to the middle seat to get any room. Hope your short or just want a two seater suv if you or you husband is tall!!"
1228, a year ago,5,for the rice has very smooth ride great handling and fun technical features was in the turbo model which is actually pretty fast!
1229, a year ago,5,"I have a 2016 ford escape se 1.6l ecoboost and I'm in love with my car however some problems I have noticed is it will need a new apim I believe its called, my entertainment system will connect to Bluetooth then not work and I often have to go into the fuse box to fix this which shouldn't be happening. Another big problem is swollen lugnuts that can be very expensive. I still love my car its my first non-beater and its great for anything whether you're single and can use the extra space or even if you have a child its the perfect size"
1230, a year ago,5,"This is my first car that I bought myself and it is great! For such an affordable price it works amazing and even though it looks small it fits plenty of stuff and the trunk is surprisingly large. Only downside is that the engine can be odd when switching gears if you have been on the highway then switch to a lower speed limit, but it doesn’t impact much and is such a little note for such an amazing vehicle."
1231, a year ago,3,"my first car was a ford fiesta! it is a very comfortable, small and versatile car.  It has problems when the engine overheats and usually generates major faults.  rest is an excellent vehicle"
1232, a year ago,3,"It’s an overall good starting vehicle, but doesn’t have enough power (difficult on uneven roads). Have have a significant amount of recalls and items to to fix over the year. The power steering doesn’t always work when started, and have to restart to fix issue."
1233, a year ago,5,My grandpa has a Ford 250 and yes it's only a 2001 but u can tell you that we put miles on it everyday and  have not once broke down in this past year  I been working with him Ford Motor Company

1235, a year ago,5,"Cute, fun car to drive. Was a little too small of a hatch for my lifestyle. But perfect for someone who wants a good daily, that’s good on gas."
1236, a year ago,5,"2018 focus st2. Awesome car, super fun to drive! Bought it used and have yet to have an issue with it. Great on gas, and soooo much room in the hatch! (100lb dog for reference)."
1237, a year ago,5,My dad owns one and this car is amazing! Full of space for this category and also very comfortable.
1238, a year ago,5,I enjoy our car. It’s smaller but spacious. The trunk has plenty of space for groceries and our stroller. The gas mileage is the best I’ve had so far.
1239, a year ago,5,"my first car, stuck with me through it all!! survived a crash and still kept running smooth after that. of course wear and tear is easily spot but it is amazing"
1240, a year ago,5,I love my ford focus. I have a 2018 hatchback and it has done me no wrong. The backseat is not fitted for tall friends but the storage space is great!
1241, a year ago,3,"It's a love hate relationship with my Fiesta. I originally bought it because I saw it on Top Gear and fell in love with it. Unfortunately the Fiestas in the US are manufactured differently than the ones in the UK. Mine has horrible transmission issues and isn't covered under the current lawsuit for it so I'm stuck with it. As much as I like it I won't be buying another ford after this, there's just too many issues."
1242, a year ago,5,"I Drive My Ford Escape Daily, I feel safe and sporty....I Love the room I have in it, I just wished it came with a tow package"
1243, a year ago,4,"My Ford escape is fairly decent on gas and comfortably spacious. I do not have many negative things to say. For my family of 3, it is the perfect size. When traveling with friends, we typically take my car as it is a very nice road trip vehicle. I would recommend for those that are looking for a decently priced spacious vehicle. "
1244, a year ago,5,Good size car and drives well. I like the parking assist and how good it is on gas. The push to start is a nice option. It is also very compatible with your phone. I would highly recommend to anyone that uses a car regularly.
1245, a year ago,4,My 1st car I purchased on my own.  Have had minimal repairs even though it's an 08. Fill the tank with $25 and your good to go to work and home for 2 weeks
1246, a year ago,5,"A very spacious, comfortable car, safe for the whole family, seats with elegant clothes, fully equipped, safe when traveling"
1247,a year ago,5,Muy confortable y cómodo. Apto para familias ya que es bastante espacioso. La principal ventaja es que los nuevos modelos estacionan solos
1248,a year ago,5,Vehículo confortable y apto para personas jóvenes. Es un poco bajito pero muy cómodo.
1249, a year ago,3,"It looks big on the outside but it's totally not a family car. It's great for 3 of us but the back gets cramped if anyone else rides with us. Oh, and you can forget about adding another car seat back there because there's no room for another adult. The back seats recline so that's a plus! Overall it's a great ride if you need a small suv"
1250, a year ago,5,Súper bonito espacioso y económico la verdad le doy un 5 estrellas porque es muy hermoso 🤩
1251, a year ago,5,I’ve owned several year models of the Ford Escape. I owned a 2015 Ford Escape Eco Version with all leather seats and I also owned the 2020 Ford Escape Eco Version with leather seats. The only difference between the 2 different year models was that the 2020 Ford Escape actually drove itself literally!! It was pretty cool driving a car that if you let go of the steering wheel it would literally stay in between the line and avoid wrecking which I though was pretty amazing. This car is definitely a gas hog though. Very expensive to maintain and keep up with.
1252, a year ago,5,This car put up with so much wear and tear and it stayed alive up until the day I traded it in.
1253, a year ago,4,"I personally love my fiesta!! It’s about 6-7 years old, but so far I’ve had very few probs."
1254, a year ago,4,Un auto que duró 6 años en mi familia. Debo ser honesta y decir que no me gusto en lo absoluto. Se descompuso varias veces. En invierno me daba mucho problemas con los frenos. No lo recomiendo para nada!!
1255, a year ago,5,"Nothing bad to say about this truck. Very comfortable for family travel and supremely comfortable. I would love to have her in the future.I have nothing to improve on this product, as it is it is perfect. Needless to say, I highly recommend it, especially when you have a family."
1256, a year ago,4,"Purchased a 2020 Ford Escape earlier this year and I LOVE it. I’m still getting used to driving a mid-size SUV (my previous car was a Focus), but I like that it’s not too big or too small. The only drawback for me is that it doesn’t have a CD player 😭. I guess that’s what Apple Play is for lol but I still love physical CDs. Otherwise, the Escape rides smooth, is great on gas and is eco-friendly."
1257, a year ago,3,"I don’t care for Fords however my daughter has this one and she loves it. If gets good gas mileage,"
1258, a year ago,5,Had a 1995 Ford mustang gt concept which I absorbed loved and wish I had but someone poured diesel down gas tank
1259, a year ago,5,My husband owns a 2018 preowned Ford Focus. Apparently the previous owner didn’t drive it but it was fully loaded and it’s a great daily driver!
1260, a year ago,3,"Someone I know has this vehicle but from years ago, it does not look very modern, it is comfortable, but I have been told that it brings a lot of problems and must be constantly being repaired"
1261, a year ago,5,"I only had this car for about a week as a rental while mine got out of the shop, and I totally loved it, runs smooth! At night your brights turn on and off depending on the cars coming, it has Bluetooth and that’s a big plus for me"
1262, a year ago,4,"For an economy car, it has great gas mileage. It isn't roomy at all and the backseat passengers that we have had have absolutely no leg room. We had a problem with ours constantly trying to shutter. It was mostly noticed at start off. This may not have been anything serious, but we ended up getting rid of the car shortly after. It wasn't for us. It was so hard to get kids in and out of it, with little leg room."
1263,a year ago,4,"I loved my Ford Escape. I especially loved the app that is free for use which allows you to see your fuel level, locate your car and start your car. I could be out of state and the app would still allow me to start or lock my car! The drive was great, I simply just needed more room so I upgraded"
1264,a year ago,5,"I have a 2011 Ford Fusion and this thing has been a great car for my family of 4. It is possible to fit a booster and infant seat in the back with enough room for a smaller adult in the middle. The trunk is roomy enough for luggage and a stroller. My car is equipped with Sync services, which is great since so many states require hands-free phone usage now. At 104,000 miles now it is still running smoothly. Excellent option for an affordable, reliable vehicle."
1265, a year ago,5,"I loved my Ford fusion and I'm so bummed that I sold it, but I sold it to buy a newer one then it didn't work out, theses cars are reliable, have plenty of room, great on gas, and they look better than most cars in their class"
1266, a year ago,5,I would say that is one of the most reliable vehicles that I ever been through because it doesn't a lit of gas and it's really comfortable
1267, a year ago,5,"At the beginning it wasn't my first choice but once I drove it, it turned into a comfortable family vehicle. That's why I would say that I recommend it to be honest"
1268, a year ago,5,"I have a 2005 Ford Expediton. I love it for my family of 4, I have 3 nieces and 1 nephew and we can comfortably travel with my sister's 4 kids and our 2. We love how roomy it is!"
1269, a year ago,4,"I like how smooth these cars drive! I like the touch screen and the Bluetooth feature. I like how fast it speeds up! It is a longer car for me to drive, I am not used to the length on it but it’s and ok car."
1270, a year ago,3,"Los vehículos Ford son cómodos para viajar, si me gusta pero más me  encanta los jeep, igual les recomiendo comprar este tipo de vehículos, aunque creo que sus precios son muy altos en Ecuador que lo hace poco adsequible a las personas."
1271, a year ago,4,"Nice and big great for kids. Not a lot to say really, reliable, not too expensive, can get parts cheap"
1272, a year ago,4,"Cheap parts to replace, great for a first car not loads of space but enough for a family of 4"
1273, a year ago,2,"I love the sleek look of the fusion and the amount of room it has, especially the truck. However the number of recalls on the vehicle is ridiculous. Every month I receive one in the mail."
1274, a year ago,5,"03 de noviembre

1275,a year ago,5,"Smooth riding car, good gas mileage on the highway, comfortable sitting, back seat is very roomy. Takes bumps and curves very nicely. Handles gravel roads decently"
1276,a year ago,5,"Everything on this car is amazing, good gas milage, heated seats are amazing, very easy driveable and relieable car."
1277, a year ago,4,"Not as roomy as I anticipated, great gas milage.  Felt cramped sitting in the back seat. Handled great the color options offered are nice.  Interior colors are nice.  Price point was ok."
1278, a year ago,4,Not a horrible commuter. There is plenty of room for passengers and luggage.  But the blind spots are troubling.
1279, a year ago,5,I really like the room and the smooth ride. Great fast mileage and I like the different drive modes. It fit my family nicely.
1280, a year ago,4,Great little car. Good gas mileage and roomier than expected. The only issue was the transmission.  Had it repaired 2 times. Thankfully it was still under warranty.
1281, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Fusion. I have a 2017 white fusion and couldn’t be happier with it. The gas mileage is great for someone who is on the road often. The screen up front is amazing for navigation and music options!
1282,a year ago,5,El auto que tengo es una explorer es super cómoda los haceintos increíbles pierdes expandir para guardar cosas en el baúl muy buena compañía y tengo en mente comprar una ecosport en un futuro
1283, a year ago,5,"Gas mileage on this vehicle is AWESOME, drive perfect, affordable and definitely a great forat car for those who are wanting to.purchase for a first time driver or even for long trips. I highly recommend this one as I have had no problems with it!"
1284, a year ago,5,"I absolutely LOVE my Ford Fusion! Not only does it look sporty, it drives as such! There's PLENTY of space on the inside, the trunk has lots of storage space, and the gas mileage... Oh the GAS MILAGE! When I traveled last year to visit family, I got 34 to 35 mpg. The lines of the car are quite lovely giving it that sporty look I mentioned earlier. HIGHLY recommend!"
1285, a year ago,5,I have the Ford fusion energy which is an amazing vehicle period you can plug it in at night and get up to 20 mi of electric driving. It's also a hybrid which gives you between 40 and 60 miles per gallon
1286, a year ago,3,Never used an Escape. Survey is flawed. I have an Edge and despite the technology malfunctions it has been a great vehicle.
1287, a year ago,5,"I drove a Ford Taurus I did not like this car what so ever!!! The body style was ugly, whe way it drove was hard,all in all it was not a good car. I would improve this car by making it a nicer car to sit in and be comfortable while driving!!! I wouldn’t recommend this car to anyone that cares about style"
1288, a year ago,4,"Perfect first new car for my partner. It is fuel efficient, easy to drive, safe, low maintenance and has many great features. Only downside has been issues with the transmission which are part of a Supreme Court class action in Australia. We are still waiting on the outcome of the case before we evaluate whether we can upgrade the vehicle. Overall we have loved having the car."
1289, a year ago,1,MY BEST FRIENDS OWNED THIS CAR AND I ABSOLUTELY HATED IT. THEY ARE NOT SPACIOUS THEY DON'T LOOK COOL LOL AND WELL I HAVE TO SAY IT GUYS... IT'S A FORD. FOUND ON ROAD DEAD LOL
1290, a year ago,5,"I drive a 2003 Ford focus in 2020 and she still runs pretty great. Love this car, very reliable.￼ this is the first two door car I have ever owned and also the first hatchback and I like both of those features now.￼"
1291, a year ago,5,This car rides smooth and doesn’t waste a lot of gas. Perfect for an everyday car and spacious inside.
1292, a year ago,5,My husband loved this car. The speed on this was great according to him. It was spacious for it being a smaller car than what I was used to.
1293, a year ago,5,I really loved this car. I loved the size and space on the inside. The trunk was a great size as well.
1294, a year ago,5,Ford focus’s are amazing cars. My husband has the focus ST and its very fast and sporty. Needs improvement in having less plastic on the interior. Its very affordable. I would highly recommend if you need an affordable car or if you’re a car enthusiast looking to turn heads!
1295, a year ago,3,"Peppy, fun little car to drive, with great gas mileage to boot. Not a huge fan of the seats though- sporty yes, but comfortable- HECK NO. I felt like a lot of the interior was missing details to make it feel more luxurious, but if you are going for sporty, this is a fun car!"
1296, a year ago,5,"Carro mais incrível que já vi. É muito lindo é uma perfeição que é até difícil falar sobre. É muito muito lindo, não tem quem não fique apaixonada por ele. Ele é lindo por fora, mas por dentro ele é muito mais que Lindo é perfeito casa detalhe do fusion. Sou completamente apaixonada. "
1297, a year ago,5,Great car good on mileage and gas. Will get you from point A to point B in no time at all. Now you can't take this car in the snow. But other then that Great car.
1298, a year ago,5,"It was an easy and lovely car. It was not my own car so I can’t tell you a lot about it, but from my experiences i can tell you it’s a good beginners car. It was an old model and I was happy with it."
1299, a year ago,5,Muy fascinante totalmente lo mejor tanto en color y diseño como los asientos el espacio de la cajuela muy bien
1300, a year ago,3,Es muy fascinante manejar o solo ir de copiloto en un carro así me encanto los asientos
1301, a year ago,4,I have a 2010 escape! She’s served me well for about 5 years. Definitely suggest if you want an SUV at a decent price
1302, a year ago,5,Es muy padre poder viajar toda la familia y no ir unos apretados ya q cuenta con asientos extras
1303, a year ago,5,Me encanta el color de mi carro es un rojo brillante y el espacio q tiene en la cajuela
1304, a year ago,4,"Very good for learning how to drive, but I had experiences with battery charging that is unloaded"
1305, a year ago,5,Es un carro de lujo mi esposo está encantado con el y Ami también me tiene encantada
1306, a year ago,3,"I’m not a huge fan of Ford. I rode in one of these a few times, I don’t think there was anything special about it. It got me from point A to B with no problems but I don’t think I would ever want to purchase one for myself."
1307, a year ago,5,I loved my ford escape it was an older model but it ran like a champ. Never had any serious issues other than regular upkeep. I would without a doubt purchase another escape. In my opinion they are affordable but may not be for everyone. The one thing I would improve upon is the amount of plastic used for the body verses metal construct like in older vehicles..
1308, a year ago,5,"Aprendí a conducir con este carro, manejarlo es demasiado fácil, me adapte muy rápido a la manera de manejarlo, creo que como un primer carro esta perfecto, par aprender a conducir sin miedo, es algo espacioso y es lo bastante cómodo, un modelo clásico"
1309, a year ago,3,"Nyc car, functions are very good..... Easy to drive..... Nice family car....... Ford is always a good brand for quality cars"
1310, a year ago,5,"I love my car. So comfy and my adjustable seats are the best! Plus, they're heated. So, bonus for me in the cold winters. I don't really care for all the buttons though. Too many for my taste. I'm a simple kind of chick when it comes to technology. But at least I get to listen to my fave bands with the CD player!"
1311, a year ago,5,"Fits all of my needs. Space enough for five people, easy to drive and makes you feel secure while doing it."
1312, a year ago,5,"I drive a 2012 Ford Escape and I LOVE the old body style. That being said, I also love the gas mileage for an SUV and how spacious the vehicle feels without being too big. We love to take this car on long trips for that reason."
1313, a year ago,5,"My husband drives our focus and it is a great, reliable vehicle. Gets awesome gas mileage and has made several 14 hour drives with no problem. The value of this car is worth it, my only complaint is I prefer SUVs."
1314, a year ago,4,Its lasted me for a long time. And let me tell you i drive the heck out of it. Im not good at maintaining my car i put oil in get oil change thats it and its never let me down. I have over 175.654 miles and it just keeps going. Love it
1315, a year ago,5,"Yo pienso que es un carro genial, cumple con todas mis expectativas y de hecho sus modelos son geniales me encantan también por lo que poseen las mejores partes automotrices."
1316, a year ago,3,Interior is very nice. I have a 2011 with heated seats. I have a big trunk that also fits lots of groceries and tge seats are collapsable. The base is amazing in the car as well. I would say the car is affordable. It drives fast for a small compact car and gets me from point a to point b. At 70k miles i only started to just now have a very small transmission leak and an issue with the key. Other than that its great
1317,a year ago,4,These are pretty good cars for the first 5-7 yrs but after that it’s all downhill. Not a favorite and could not recommend.
1318, a year ago,5,"Excelente concesionario de vehículos, una de las mejores a nivel mundial, son automóviles cómodos para viajes largos. Muy confortables y puedes caber con toda ri familia."
1319, a year ago,5,"Smooth driving car, one of my friend have Ford Escape and we usually drive to Sydney."
1320, a year ago,3,I loved a lot about this vehicle however it has a very small engine for being an suv. I think having a v6 engine would help give this much better performance. Price was pretty high for lack of horsepower.
1321, a year ago,5,"Great sedan for the family who doesn’t want a SUV. Very spacious, and gas mileage is great. Perfect cost for what a great car."
1322, a year ago,5,"Love my 2016 Escape. Wonderful interior, gas mileage is wonderful, and it’s a small suv that GOES! Definitely one of my favorite cars!"
1323, a year ago,5,My Ford Edge is A-Ma-zing!!  I have always been a girl that lives bigger SUV’s however this car rides like a dream.  It’s roomy and super comfortable.  I love all of the gadgets and gizmos included but the best is that it makes a great traveling vehicle to the mountains.  Gotta love this Colorado drives and they’re even better in a comfortable ride.
1324,a year ago,5,I liked this car but even though it is not a big car I would prefer something a little bit small because I am a small person.
1325, a year ago,4,"This is a great car, small but a lot of space, fast and strong. It’a better to get the one with 5 doors. I recommend this for junior drivers or who has small place to park"
1326,a year ago,4,This a fun car to drive.  Gets good gas mileage and affordable.  It is a smaller car and I am not sure how a tall person would be comfortable in it.   I would recommend this car.
1327, a year ago,4,Good interior space. Very comfortable and super easy to handle everything you need. I will always recommend!
1328, a year ago,4,"An sich ein schöner Stadtflitzer, jedoch recht beengt im Innenraum. Kleiner Kofferraum. Ansonsten schön zu fahren!"
1329,a year ago,5,Me encanta a sido mi primer carro y aqui aprendi a manejar muy comodo si tienes baby la verdad lo recomiendo
1330,a year ago,5,Great car and comfortable but I dont like the night feature on the side mirrors  and other mirros with the blue tint... its pretty distracting
1331,a year ago,3,Not a bad vehicle to be in . More of a sturdier care . I’d definitely recommend this over a lot of others
1332,a year ago,2,Not a fan of these vehicles . All the ones I’ve been in seem to rust out and clunk in the back end or sound rough. That’s more for the older than 2010s for sure
1333, a year ago,5,I will forever be purchasing a Ford. They have been providing to my family for decades and will be for plenty to come. I have a 2017 which was purchased in 2019 and the only things I have had to do on it was get a new battery and replace two tires!!!!
1334, a year ago,5,my daughter has a ford escape...........it rides so easy......and it has all the essentials that you have ever wanted........it is so easy on gas.........it has such a beautiful color.......the seats are so awesome and heated........ty. 
1335, a year ago,5,"Great car as far as I running. My boyfriend had this car 3 years now and nothing major has been wrong with it yet . He had to pay someone to fix the door on it because the window wouldnt go down. Also the main light is out and the tires were bad,but other than that everything was good"
1336, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Ford Focus. I own a 2014 hatchback version. The only problem is when it goes to take off it shutters.
1337, a year ago,5,I love my Ford F250 truck.   It gets the job done and has a nice comfortable ride and is dependable.  Not really sure I get the point of all these snaps.
1338, a year ago,5,"This was my first car purchase in the early 2000’s and I had a yellow two door focus. I was so excited to have my own vehicle. It was good on gas, not bad on maintenance( the big stuff anyway). The price wasn’t bad, but I could have shopped around a little longer. There wasn’t a lot of space just enough for a single person with no kids. I traded mine in for more space since we were starting a family"
1339, a year ago,5,I have just got a ride in this car. It was awesome feeling. Its really comfortable space and i guess driving too.
1340, a year ago,4,"I’ve had my 09 fusion for about 2 and a half years now and I love it! The car is older so i’ve ran into maintenance issues but other than that I love everything about my car! It’s easy to drive, safe, and fast. Definitely a great starter car!"
1341, a year ago,5,"Ford Fusion Sports my favorite car love hey once I was in my brother is so you know they are good cars like I said they're very good, North room for two kids,"
1342, a year ago,5,No I'd give it a fast of the cost is driving real smooth I like the way gas station I can go to Texas and come back and come back and
1343,a year ago,5,"Excelente  súper cómodo económico y seguro muy confiable  de usar ................,,,,,"
1344, a year ago,5,I love it.  Runs good and so far no issues. Had it since 2007.   I don’t have any issues with it.  Wheels spin a little when starting off but can adjust how I take off.  
1345, a year ago,5,"I am a Ford girl for sure! I’m on my 3rd, 3 year lease with Ford Fusions. The car drives fantastic and I get great gas mileage. I’m one happy customer 😊"
1346,a year ago,5,Personally I have loved having a ford focus  and will continue to choose ford for my next future vehicle. Hands down my go to brand for reliability and just a good brand.
1347, a year ago,3,"I drive an '09 focus and its a great car. Nothing too fancy (it is 11 years old at this point) but maintenance tends to be inexpensive and I anticipate it running until about 275,000 miles. It's a lightweight car so I tend to slide a bit in the rain and it does not do phenomenal in snow but can deal with it alright."
1348, a year ago,4,It is a nice vehicle. I have never owned a Ford but this vehicle is roomy and the dashboard is laid out good
1349, a year ago,4,It is ok for a Ford.  There was enough room to be fairly comfortable.  It is a little smaller than I prefer
1350, a year ago,4,"Really nice and faster car, it's very confortable, faster and easy to maintenance. It's ideal for beginners. I really like it's new design."
1351,a year ago,2,The car is way too uncomfortable and small on the inside and way too many factory issues that are a major cost repair. I would NOT own this car.
1352, a year ago,4,"Tiene pocos km todavía no tengo una opinión formada en cuanto a su andar, pero me gusta en general, tengo alguna duda a que cuando lo cierro este , no cierra los cristales ni techo, mientras que otros vehículos si lo hacen, incluso podía bajar los vidrios con la llave, en este no."
1353, a year ago,5,I actually own a ford explorer but this app won’t let me review it. We got it a year ago due to my Toyota breaking down on me while drive to and from school. This was a present but was paid for with our money in a way. I love it. No issues here.
1354, a year ago,5,I have rented this for a road trip and was so comfortable. I'm really impressed with the whole driving experience. I hope to someday own one. I lived it.
1355, a year ago,5,I love this product! I would highly recommend to my friends and family who would want this product!
1356, a year ago,5,It was a smaller car but I loved it when I owned it years ago! Very reliable! Great price and drove great.

1361, a year ago,2,"I had the opportunity to rent this car while is was on vacation in Los Angeles. This car was small cramped and had ZERO power. If you've ever been in  LA you know there are some serious hills, this car did not handle the hills well at all. I would never recommend this vehicle. "
1362, a year ago,5,My brother owns the brand new 2020 model and he loves it but im very on the fence about it. The interior is nice but the breaks are really touchy and it’s just not a favorite of mine
1363, a year ago,4,"Easy to drive and navigate.
It was a rental car but had no problems.
A little on the smaller side."
1364,a year ago,5,"Began driving a Focus whenever my other car was in the shop and loved it. Great fit, good pickup, a joy to drive. When the time came for a new car I didn't hesitate to head to the Ford dealership and got a wonderful used one. Still driving it now, love it just wish it had a little more room in the back. AWESOME gas mileage!"
1365, a year ago,5,Incredible mileage for both city and highway. Drives very smooth. No cons as of this moment.
1366, a year ago,5,"I love this car, it is very beautiful, good engine             the cylinders and everything works very well"

I love this car. She has amazing with space and ease of handling.a"
1370, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my Ford Fiesta SE, it handles so well. I live in Louisiana and she just rolls with all the punches. Easy to clean, on pump. She does have some problems with engine but talk to the dealership before buying. ABSOLUTELY WILL, Ford is a helpful company as well"
1371, a year ago,5,"If I could afford a new car right now, I would buy a Ford Escape.  I rented one for a weekend trip.  It was comftable, stylish and great on gas mileage.  I absolutely fell in love with it."
1372, a year ago,5,Drove a Ford Fusion for work.  I really liked it.  It got great gas mileage and sat very comfortably.  It was a very reliable car also
1373, a year ago,4,"My first car was a Focus Hatchback. I still miss it! It was a pleasure to ride, it was an excellent car, nicely designed, good mechanic too."
1374,a year ago,5,"My husband drives one & it’s nice. I really like it, drives nice & has a lot of room. Great car if you have kids for sure!"
1375,a year ago,1,"I hate it. It’s TINY, everytime you hit a bump the whole car swerves everywhere, not a smooth ride. I wouldn’t recommend this car to anyone actually. 🤦🏼‍♀️"
1376, a year ago,4,Great car I have the four wheel drive and it works amazing in the snow and drives me all the places where I need to go she works great and I love her and I wouldn’t trade her she is reliable and awesome in every terrain.
1377, a year ago,5,"I like drive, my car is very especial , so no soy buena con las reseñas pero  me gusta es un auto gris hermoso"
1378, a year ago,2,I am not a big Ford person so I didnt give this very many stars. Also I test drove one and it didn't drive good at all! I also was surprised by the gas mileage too. I think they are expensive for what they are.
1379, a year ago,5,This is a trustworthy car. It has great features and is very roomie. The car appears to be very safe and easy to drive. I would recommend buying this car
1380, a year ago,5,"This was my first North American used car i had ever bought and I can't be happier.  I love this car.  It rides so smooth and has quite a bit of power.  It is also my first non-compact car which I thought would be too big, but it actually makes me feel safer.  I would recommend this car to anyone."
1381, a year ago,5,"I loved using this vehicle. It was a nice enjoyable quiet ride every time I got in. Hate having work done on a car but if my rental is this I'd be wanting this each time. For me it isn't within budget to purchase this car but if I was looking for a vehicle and could afford much beyond 20k I would start here. I felt ritzy in this vehicle and when I had a child in school and their friends, this made for a great impression. Haven't been too many Ford cars or vehicles I like but this is one for sure. Room to grow with this vehicle."
1382, a year ago,3,Gas mileage and interior are great. Drove well until I purchased new tires. Go with the ones it came with as others are very noisy and does not ride as well. 800 for a set is worth it. Lots of trouble with back brakes going out a few times in one year due to anti locking on tire being broke when tires were changed by dealer. Wheel locked up a few times without Ford acknowledging fault. Oil leaks just after warranty ended and dealer fighting me about it leaking . In shop 7 days and battery was replaced without leak fixed! Air went out after last visit to dealership and not taking responsibility for it I traded it in for a nissan. Ford knows the issues with these vehicles but refuse to repair unless it's at your cost
1383, a year ago,5,"I’ve always been completely against Ford vehicles. However, since buying my 2017 Ford Fusion Titanium almost a year ago, I have fallen in love. I can go up to 2 weeks before I have to get gas. My car drives great and knock on wood, has yet to have any problems with it!"
1384, a year ago,5,We have an F250 and I love our big red truck! We have only had her for about 2 years now but now I would be lost without her. We haven't had any major problems with her either!
1385,a year ago,4,"I love driving my Escape! It is a great car overall, no issues or breakdowns. I don’t like the super small screen it has though, I do wish it was bigger, I also wish that it was press to start rather than having a key. Those are all personal issues though!"
1386, a year ago,4,Love the car radio shorted out on me though an some other small issues ! But great on gas an nice size ! Trunk has plenty of space! 
1387, a year ago,5,"The ford fiesta was the first car I ever purchased brand spanking new in 2015! It was SO good on gas, and I only had to fill up once a week at $20 a pop! It drove very smooth and I loved that I could change the colors of the lights in the interior. It's a small car but I had no problem putting a car seat in it and having kids in and out."
1388,a year ago,3,It’s a nice comfortable ride. Good gas mileage. Enough room for family to go out together for activities and family outings. And have enough space for luggage and kids stuff that you need to carry with you.
1389, a year ago,5,Wonderful car for my husband. He loves the gas mileage and fuel tank size while still maintaining the sedan bodystyle. Spacious trunk and backseat.
1390, a year ago,5,Great midsize SUV. Perfect for a small family or pet lovers. SYNC3 is a wonderful feature we love in our escape.
1391, a year ago,5,Love my 2013 ford focus. I love that I had an option on a small car to get a manual transmission. Con would be that it is slightly outdated with the roll up back seat windows and the front electric windows.
1392, a year ago,5,I don’t own it but have been a passenger and it has a smooth ride. My mom loves this vehicle so much she drives just for the fun of it!
1393, a year ago,5,"El mejor auto, rápido y seguro además tiene una alta comodidad y un espacio increíble me encanta.  Las pocas veces que lo he usado me parece magnífico y lo recomiendo al 200 cumple con todas mis expectativas y son muy preciosos sus modelos. Genial"
1394, a year ago,5,"Love this car very reliable, super cheap on gas and parts, it has heated seats which I love in the winter and Bluetooth great first starter car mine is a 2009 and I love it a lot of trunk space for being so compacted,"
1395, a year ago,5,"2013 Ford fusion is great dependable car. I have had it since 2014 with 16,000 miles ... I have only had to take care of routine maintenance to date 😁."
1396, a year ago,2,Not a big fan. I had an older one and it had its fair share of problems. Always something new going on and wasn’t affordable to begin with. I wouldn’t own another one of these for anything.
1397, a year ago,4,I can’t say a whole lot about this car since I wasn’t the primary driver. Several people in my family have owned the escape of varies years. They hold up well and seem like fairly easy maintenancing. ￼
1398, a year ago,5,2013 Ford Escape runs pretty well. It has taken a lot of bumps from other car doors at train stations  and holding up pretty nice. Smooth drive and decent amount of room inside. Affordable car.
1399, a year ago,5,again it’s okay i don’t really notice a differnce when i’m a passenger in different cars
1400, a year ago,5,"i don’t really know, it’s my dads car, it’s okay i’ve driven it a few times but it’s just like any other war"
1401, a year ago,5,I would love to enjoy this car at the moment I have not had the fortune to have it but I would like since it is very practical and beautiful I like its functions and how fast it is
1402, a year ago,5,"This car is super cool, the color they handle is very nice and makes you stand out before everyone, it gives you poise and gives you comfort, it is super practical for trips and for a family outing"
1403, a year ago,5,"So my sister drives this car and it’s lovely, she’s never had no problems with it, I used to drive this when I was learning to drive and it’s such a smooth reliable car. Really good features on the car aswell"
1404,a year ago,4,"Sería el auto de mis sueños, no creo que solo para mi y no solo por su apariencia si no por lo que promete"
1405, a year ago,4,Love the interior. Nice and roomy. The options are great.  Wish I had the talk to text.
1406, a year ago,5,"Es bonito, me gustaría en un futuro tener uno, es cómodo, no es ruidoso, es estético, no le encontre fallas, fue una corta experiencia. Ojala en un futuro pueda tener una experiencia más a fondo para realizar una mejor reseña"
1407, a year ago,1,Don't don't dont buy this car every year i have a recall i bought it brand new off the floor cash outright in 2013 had the clutch replaced 3 time since then most recently a 1.5yr ago still giving troubles time to back in for a 4th clutch. Its been the worse car for recalls ever
1408, a year ago,5,"Genera confianza, tiene comodidad, perfectas experiencias, te da seguridad y sientes calidad, es el mejor auto para tus actividades, además de tener un diseño deportivo y con el motor más potente en su categoría, tiene la mejor tecnología automotriz"
1409, a year ago,5,My sister owns a Ford Escape and it’s so comfortable. It runs smooth and I love that it’s a gas saver. I would definitely want to buy one in the feature.
1410, a year ago,5,"My son owns a Ford Fusion and I've had the opportunity to drive it on occasion.  The car is roomy and quite comfortable.  It is an economical car if you have to commute due to the great gas mileage it gets.  This car is an awesome car if you're in the market for an affordable means of transportation that won't make you sacrifice style, options and comfort to own."
1411, a year ago,5,"I recently had the opportunity to drive a Ford Escape Platinum.  I normally drive an Expedition and was skeptical about the size difference.  The Escape had a smooth ride, was comfortable to ride in, and had great acceleration.  It felt roomy and would be a great car if you're in the market for a new car!"
1412, a year ago,1,I have purchased two focuses and both were terrible. The transmission in both (all Ford focuses that I have known) have issues. It would jump and act like I was shifting a manual car and missing a gear when in fact it was automatic. I got rid of both very quickly.
1413, a year ago,5,"Can't go wrong with FORD, Ford has been in my family for a long times. Cars, Trucks, & SUVS are always sturdy and I don't usually have issues! They are nice and affordable for the quality of car that is offered. It doesn't guzzle gas which is nice because I live about 50 mins away from work"
1414,a year ago,5,Perfume con buena fragancia y buena presentación. Agradable para cualquier ocasión. Recomendado. Accesible.
1415,a year ago,5,Carros seguros y con repuestos muy accesibles. Buenos para viajes cortos y largos. Sus diseños también son innovadores
1416,a year ago,5,Carros seguros y con repuestos muy accesibles. Buenos para viajes cortos y largos. Sus diseños también son innovadores
1417, a year ago,2,"This car was nothing but problems. While buying used was a big part upon doing further research many others report problems with even new Escapes. Ours was totalled after ice made us hit a barricade at 35mph. TOTALLED AT 35mph!!! We tell everyone, avoid Escapes like the plague."
1418,a year ago,5,Autos cómodos y versátiles. Familiares y seguros. Buenos motores y repuestos accesibles. Me gustan.
1419, a year ago,3,"This wasn’t my favorite vehicle. Drove it as a rental. Felt like I was in a tiny vehicle, but I did feel that it handled well. Fiestas are pretty affordable and good if you like a smaller vehicle. The Interior was nice."
1420, a year ago,4,Good little runner if not a little boxy for my taste. Lots of fake buttons on the dash that serve no purpose.
1421,a year ago,5,"It's a very comfortable and spacious car, adding that it is very pretty and elegant. I love the model"
1422, a year ago,5,Es un auto cómodo amplio de buen rendimiento que permite una buena cilindrada optimizando los niveles de gasolina tanto para la admisión como el escape por lo que permite que tenga una mayor potencia y una relación de compresión excelente se recomienda la compra de este
1423, a year ago,5,"I love the car because it is spacious. I have 5 kids and with my husband, we fit perfectly. It has space in the back to put our stuff when we go shopping. My kids don’t feel overcrowded even though we have three car seats."
1424, a year ago,4,"My husband owns this car, he really enjoys it but for me the inside just seems super small and not as nice on the inside as some of the cars I own."
1425, a year ago,2,"My aunt had a newer one of these. We drove to Utah from Washington. It broke down on the way back to Washington. We were stuck in Utah for weeks! It took them a couple weeks to even figure out what was wrong, something with the thermostat. When it was driving it had no get up and go and it looks like an average stock suv. Nothing special in my opinion"
1426, a year ago,5,My favorite car!!!! It’s so sleek and the sound system is fantastic! I love the back up camera and the sync features. It handles well and drives smoothly. I love the gas mileage and the electronic alerts about the vehicle.
1427, a year ago,4,This car was ok. For an suv doesnt have much more room in the back for passengers. Was kind of smushed back there
1428, a year ago,5,Love my ford fusion. I have the 6 cylinder one so its a good family car. But its also fast. And has a lot of get up and go
1429, a year ago,5,I loved my Ford Focus! It was an awesome family car.  It was compact enough to go anywhere yet roomy enough to go on long road trips and be comfortable. I love the affordability of this vehicle. I also loved the gas milage.  It was a great value purchase. 
1430,a year ago,5,"Me gusto mucho este modelo de auto, muy vanguardista y muy cómodo por dentro. Muy buen auto y con repuestos accesibles."
1431, a year ago,3,I had high hopes for this vehicle but it does not ride smooth in my opinion and that is something I don't like when driving in a city environment. I had decent mileage but there's better out there at a cheaper price point.
1432, a year ago,3,"Could be just the model, but have had plenty of recalls for this vehicle.  Besides that, the car runs smoothly and gets great MPG."
1433, a year ago,5,Great car! I had a 2005 Ford Focus and it was my favorite car! It ran for so long and was reliable
1434, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Ford Escape! It is perfect and reliable for all of the different seasons!
1435, a year ago,3,We rented this car for a vacation in the Costa Brava of Spain and it was a very uncomfortable experience. The car did not only consume a lot of gas but was not so nice to drive. It had a lot of space though
1436, a year ago,4,"I had an older Ford Escape, and I upgraded a few years back! It was always a great car but the older years didn’t have side airbags and not as many safety features which is what made me switch. Always a reliable car!"
1437, a year ago,4,"excellent car for getting around the city, comfortable and spacious despite being small"
1438, a year ago,4,It was a good car for me at the time. I bought it when they first came out. Had the hatchback model.
1439, a year ago,5,"Me parece super jenial ♥️ 
Quiero comprarla para mí y mi familia ya que es muy amplia y se mira muy cómoda ♥️ espero 
Pronto poder comprarla ♥️"
1440,a year ago,4,"We are a Ford family, but we've had issues with both of our vehicles above and beyond normal wear and tear and maintenance."
1441, a year ago,4,"Great mid-sized SUV. Does not have intense torque or horsepower but great for lugging around stock, groceries, having a family. Elevated and sleek design, affordable and easy going. Also fantastic during the winter months allowing you to not get stuck in snow banks."
1442, a year ago,4,"I’ve had this car for the last 6 years and love it! I have had a couple of minor engine issues, but overall have gotten great use out of it! It gets great gas mileage!"
1443, a year ago,4,"My husband and I are both tall.  We found this vehicle to be relatively small and with small children in car seats we were not comfortable.  It is an affordable option but unless you’re shorter or have more compact seats or older children, I was not a fan for us.  Sporty look and great fuel economy just not a great fit for me in particular."
1444, a year ago,5,The car It's very comfortable and very beauthy The color is fantastic Very wide  and this os for The family i love so much He meets all my expectations this is unic
1445, a year ago,3,Okay so I have had this car for 6 years so I think I have a pretty good scope on things. I wouldn’t purchase again. Interior and exterior materials are cheap & the car is slow to catch speed when pressing the gas.
1446, a year ago,5,I rented a Ford Fusion for a week and it really was a great driving car and very affordable. I have been in the car business my whole life and I can honestly say that Ford has came along way and this is a great driving car for the money. Has a lot of new technology and safety features
1447, a year ago,5,"It’s compact, very comfortable and easy to drive car. Although I own a 2012 Ford Fiesta, I can’t speak about the new models that came after that but I can say I’m very pleased with the one I have. Would maybe change the radio"
1448, a year ago,4,"I love having a Ford Escape because it's large enough for me to transport bigger items but not so large that it feels difficult to drive on busy roads. I do feel like my brakes squeak quite a bit no matter how frequently I change my brake pads though, and I wish the screen/entertainment system in my vehicle were a little more reliable."
1449,a year ago,5,"Great gas mileage, comfortable ride, enough space for what I need. Ford is an America made brand!"
1450, a year ago,4,This is overall a good car. It is great on gas and spacious for its compact size. I never had any issues with this car only decided to get something bigger for the family. It is well worth its affordable price and I recommend it often.
1451, a year ago,3,"Realmente no puedo dar una gran opinión, ya que no soy una persona que sabe manejar, sin embargo he visto el modelo y realmente es muy bonito, tiene una estética increíble y los asientos son muy confortables"
1452, a year ago,4,I like driving this car. No complaints so far . The color I have is silver. I really don’t like driving
1453, a year ago,4,Good seats and comfy. But I would say not tall people friendly. But a good car overall.
1454, a year ago,5,"Solid ride, enough car around you to feel safe & secure. Very roomy for large families."
1455, a year ago,3,Have had a few issues but overall I love it! Small little hatchback which is perfect for me as I am only one person and have no kids. She needs some updates but no complaints from me besides I wish it was brand new.
1456, a year ago,3,Isn't my first choice of a car but I was recently in the accident with my Grand Prix so I had to get this for focus. I'm short so it works out because it's a little car but I don't like this car. It drive good in everything it's good on gas but for me this is not the car for me. I want a Dodge Charger or Challenger.
1457, a year ago,5,"My sister had a Ford Fusion and I loved it! Great features inside, great space! Able to fit two car seats and a rider in the back seat comfortably. Not too bad on gas mileage. Great trunk space too!"
1458, a year ago,5,"Fantastic car! Not only was this a great car to drive, I was in a pretty bad accident in it and it held up wonderfully compared to the other vehicle involved. Easy maintenance and priced just right!"
1459, a year ago,5,Great vehicle for driving in the city. You can park literally anywhere. It is also great for long trips because you get AMAZING gas mileage!
1460, a year ago,2,Small and simple. This vehicle will get the job of running around town done nicely. Ford Fusion is great on gas mileage.
1461, a year ago,5,Es un carro muy bonito muy amplio para llevar a toda la familia excelente para tus viajes y súper cómodo para todos !.
1462, a year ago,5,"I got an escape as a rental when our truck was being repaired. I truly loved it. Not a lot of room if you have 2 kids in car seats! Nonetheless, I really really liked the escape. Easy on gas! Comfy ride."
1463, a year ago,5,"Great mini suv! Love the updated edition with Apple CarPlay.  Easy handling, nice interior features, great gas mileage.  Great price for what you pay for."
1464, a year ago,4,It would be 5 stars if the brakes weren’t so touchy. Nice interior and a wonderful color of blue paint.
1465, a year ago,5,"I had a 2003 Ford Escape and I adored it! Highly recommend. My uncle works on ford cars. I was fortunate enough to have him fix little problems that occurred during my time owning this car. Eventually I got a new car due to the starter, but I loved driving this SUV."
1466, a year ago,4,I'm currently driving my second Ford escape. The first one I bought 4 years old and drove it for 12. I love smaller suvs bc they have more room than sedans but aren't huge.
1467, a year ago,4,"It has a smooth ride, exceleration is not great at all. The interior of the car is roomer than expected. Gas mileage is not good. overall It not good nor bad.  The 2020 model starts at 20,000 thats not expensive, so not a bad deal. I recommend this vehicle"
1468, a year ago,4,"My sister have a fusion,she loves it. I drove it and it handles good poor on exceleration. It has more space than you think it would have and provides a comfortable ride."
1469, a year ago,2,Worst car I ever had. Tons of issues. The locks always jammed. I had to crawl out the window. I got rid of it after a year of owning.
1470, a year ago,4,"Smooth ride, sleek lines, fun to drive. Good in the snow, easy maintenance, decent gas mileage for a small suv, love the interior."
1471, a year ago,4,"For the most part, my 2013 Ford Focus has been a great little car... my car has been great on gas and comfortable, which are the 2 most important things when I’m buying a vehicle. It has plenty of trunk space and a sleek, stylish design. I have the optional moonroof and steel wheels along with a few more nice little upgrades. Overall, a great value for what I paid several years ago. Has held up pretty well with minimal maintenance."
1472, a year ago,4, Ford Focus I think this is a cute little beginner car. They have really improved the look of this car and I think they increased the price as well. 
1473, a year ago,4,I love my Ford Fusion! I think it is super reliable and pretty nice-looking. I get great gas mileage and feel that the car is roomy without being huge. I got mine used for a really good price and haven’t had to put much money into it.
1474, a year ago,4,"uno de los vehículos mas estables de su tipo, los modelos anteriores sobre todo 2010'2011 creo que superan en belleza y confort los mas actuales, con un consumo prácticamente mínimo "
1475,a year ago,5,Best car to drive. Good mileage. I can rely on a car like this. It not my own car but its rented and the hiring rates are quite reasonable.
1476, a year ago,4,"Ottima automobile,robusta e facile da guidare.Non consuma molto e mi trovo molto bene.il design è veramente elegante e sportivo."
1477, a year ago,1,We ended up with one of these for a rental while our Chevy was being fixed cosmetically and we could tell how cheap it was. And sooooo many controls and buttons. Too much going on for a cheap little car. I wasn’t impressed.
1478, a year ago,5,This is a pretty slick car. Love the design and its interior. Ford has improved its technology. I have the automatic transmission and its very responsive. Its good when its traffick since its a bit small so you can get by small spaces also in small patking spaces.
1479, a year ago,1,"It’s so bad car, has a lot of problems. I had one and I never will buy Ford anymore.
Problems with transmission.
The only good thing is the sound"
1480, a year ago,3,I can only go buy the first one I leased. Rhe master brake cylinder had to be replaced. The electronic window would not close. My experience was pretty awful! However I had a rental of the Focus and it was a dream to drive
1481, a year ago,4,My mom has one. Drives smooth. No problems except the battery died at 5 yrs old. Normal wear and tear. Xhe is pleased.
1482, a year ago,1,Not a ford fan. Tried to keep an open mind and took it for a test drive but didn’t like the car. Felt like Toyota gives you much more for your money.
1483, a year ago,4,10 years ago I owned a 2007 Ford escape and I must say that for just my son and I it was a perfect little SUV. Very spacious and reliable. Did not have very great pickup speed on a freeway but other than that it was a perfect car that hardly ever gave me any trouble.
1484, a year ago,4,My aunt drove this car and I was a passenger in it I love it has great leg room and everything
1485, a year ago,5,Love it very comfy you can use for long trips far or near is like your best friend. Not use that mush gas.
1486, a year ago,3,"A pretty good vehicle. I feel the body on it dings and dents too easily.  Did have some problems over the course of 2 years, nothing too major. I would try another Ford but probably not a Focus. Sorry :( Ford Focus"
1487, a year ago,5,"Love my 2017 Ford Escape. It is reliable, has great gas mileage, and is so easy and comfortable to drive. This is the second escape I have owned in my lifetime and I love them! They work great and they are a great car."
1488, a year ago,3,My mother had one and hers ran super bad. I always heard fords were hard on the power steering. But that was rough seeing her car
1489, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape! It's the perfect size for my family! With two dogs and an 8 month old, we need all the trunk space we can get. I have enough room for a stroller, toys and groceries. Its fantastic on gas and I love the AWD feature on snowy Canadian winter days."
1490, a year ago,5,"I particularly liked how comfortable its spaces are, it doesn't have much storage for suitcases, but it's like for small trips or single people who don't need much space. The spare parts are easy to get, it has comfortable seats, a super practical compartment for glasses."
1491, a year ago,3,"It is a beautiful car with different speeds, aesthetically it is beautiful and of good quality, comfortable for small trips and easy to drive. It is comfortable and 5 people can go without problems in it. I like the quality of the car.Nice seats and compartments! "
1492, a year ago,5,I love this car! I’ve had it for 3 years now and it’s the perfect affordable suv! I would change if I could the size of the screen and the ability for the back up camera to beep! Otherwise an awesome car!
1493, a year ago,5,"It's a great car, I think very confortable and with many accessories.
Nice esthetic and biggest inside.  Ford Motor Company"
1494, a year ago,5,Smooth and quiet ride. I like that it can be hybrid. Very roomy trunk and the seats are comfy
1495, a year ago,4,"Bon vehicule coter economie dessence. Banc confortable que se sois pour court ou long trajet en voiture. Le seul petit hic est que coter vehicule familiale ( avec bebe dans coquille) sa condamne le siege passager avant, mais pour se qui es du reste jaime se vehicule"
1496, a year ago,3,"Carro bom também mais sou mais a Renault,mais depende existe carros da Ford que devem ser maravilhosos como meu sonho e espero em breve realizar daqui alguns meses é Ford Ranger Limited amo picapes.E essa eu super recomendo pra meninos e meninas exigentes."
1497,a year ago,3,Not a ford fan.ive never drove one but have rode in a couple. Like this car though. For a ford brand it rode smooth and was nice

1499, a year ago,5,Me encanta el diseño!!!! Ideal para una familia con hijos!!! 😍 😍 Se ve cómodo para viajar a larga distancia!!!! 😍 😍
1500, a year ago,5,I love Ford they have amazing customer service and repair centers. When you purchase a newer car your get a great warranty that usually covers all major parts or they offer extended warranty’s when that runs out. They are dependable cars and I honestly would choose a good ford over a lot of more expensive vehicles. You have to have sync that literally does everything for you to drive hands free-music phone calls every thing you need to drive safely hands free. I have purchased 2 (one certified pre owned-1 brand new with 0miles) in the last 10 years and I have NOT ONE complaint with any service I received or either cars. They both lasted years and were absolutely dependable. I would absolutely recommend and would LOVE to own another ford in the future.
1501, a year ago,5,Love love love love love love love love love love love love live love love loe love love love love love lovw
1502, a year ago,4,Very nice car super confortable and cozy. Nice driven and fast speed. Loads a lot of people. Nice colores very nice seats. I woudl improve by adding more features. Quite expensively I'd say not dor everybody. Yes i would totally recommend!!!!

1504, a year ago,5,"Wow what a car ,comfortable in setting ,attractive design ,with beautiful colours,with aussume feautre,and securtiy is full and interior design is very good ,best milage, it good for holidays ,wow plz check it out ,with music and best feautre"
1505, a year ago,5,Es un automóvil muy cómodo además que da la seguridad y confianza  en caso de algún accidente. Es demasiado cómodo para ir de paseo con amigos o família.
1506, a year ago,2,I have a horrible time with accelerating in this car. And Ford has had a bad history with the fiesta. I bought mine thinking it had fixed the problems with the transmission but I don’t think they have. I give it partial points for being easy to parallel park and it’s cheap cost.
1507, a year ago,5,"If I had to say one good thing about the Ford Fusion I would say that it is dependable. My family has owned our Fusion since the year it was manufactured - which was 2009. Now, 11 years later, the car is still running and in pretty good shape. That's more than I can say for any other car that my family has owned."
1508, a year ago,3,"This car is great for what I bought it for (mpg, more storage than a sedan) but it’s by no means my dream car. As soon as I pay it off, it’s getting traded in for another car. Great if you’re a college student who drives a lot, but I also now have two dogs (only had one when I bought it) and it’s not super functional anymore."
1509, a year ago,5,Super comfortable and very user friendly. Ford does a great job of making a comfortable ride for both driver and passenger
1510, a year ago,5,We have a few of these at work. I like them! Very nice!!! Fancy car! Like luxury on a budget!
1511, a year ago,5,Love this car! Surprised at how nice it is! Theres a back up camera and it rides smooth.
1512, a year ago,5,"Great car. Although I feel like you can sort of tell that it is more of a budget vehicle when you’re sitting in it. Interior space could be better, but that’s a given, it’s a focus! I would recommend"
1513, a year ago,5,"very good machine, fantastic performance. IT IS VERY WELL MADE, SPACIOUS, COMFORTABLE AND WELL FINISHED AND ACCESSORIES. THE STRONG POINTS ARE THE FRAME AND THE SUSPENSIONS, THE MULTI-LINK REAR TRAIN MAKES THE DIFFERENCE FROM COMPETITORS WITH INTERCONNECTED AXLE."
1514, a year ago,4,Love this car. Its fuel economy is good and lasted a long time. It's done a lot of kms and yet with consistent services it's still in good condition. Had it for a long time and no chance of it packing up any time soon. Boot size is also generous and the other functions operate exactly how they should.
1515, a year ago,4,"Bueno es pequeño y bonito, es suave al manejar bueno eso dicen mis hermanos por que yo no sé conducir 😆😆"
1516, a year ago,5,"I had an older model of the Ford Fusion, but it was absolutely my most favorite car I have had so far. It had the perfect amount of everything I wanted and it was easy to add on things I liked in the interior."
1517,a year ago,5,"This car is very nice, inside is so roomy  and how its set up is luxury and rides so smooth. I would recommend  one of these"
1518, a year ago,4,"I like to think I’m a strong, independent woman with a tender heart and a love for the outdoors. This car is the perfect fit to my lifestyle. I can put a ton in the trunk or lay the seats down and I’ve even carried a painter’s ladder. (Hatchback) I’ve also got a bike rack for cycling and it’s small enough that I feel comfortable, and there’s a ton of natural light because the windows are larger, with I find scrumptious."
1519, a year ago,4,Similar to the Kia Forte - easy to figure out and spacious even though it’s compact. Smooth to drive -  no huge issues
1520, a year ago,3,I love the size and style of the car. It is very comfortable to drive for me and my taller boyfriend. The hatchback is great for adventures. There have been a few quirks that I havent liked but I would purchase a newer model in the futere
1521, a year ago,4,my sister has this car. but i like it a lot. it’s cute and a good size. i’ve only driven it a few times but the only complaint i have is the engine auto shutoff thing but you can turn that off so :)
1522, a year ago,5,"Fast pick up this car, when I had it. I had to trade this one in for a bigger vehicle only because my family was growing and expanding. If wasn't for that I would've definitely kept this affordable and good on gas mileage car. I highly recommend for couples and people with small family of 4 to 5."
1523, a year ago,4,"No me gusta ford fiesta, es muy pequeño porque tengo una familia grande me encanta la marca pero el modelo no"
1524, a year ago,5,"I simply love it! My husband and I bought a 2017 FF and although we prefer bigger cars, this baby right here has good leg room, a back up camera, and is super fast. No extra foot power is needed to go fast. And it is great on gas. I definitely recommend this car!"
1525, a year ago,5,"I have a 2008 Ford Focus and honestly this car is great! Great on gas! A great car for long rides, comfortable! It is a small car, but it’s a good car!"
1526, a year ago,5,"Ford is a nice car that runs very well, it has beautiful interior and also, the exterior too is so beautiful. I have been using Ford for a couple of years now and I can tell you it's a brand you can trust"
1527, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Expedition. It perfectly seats my family of six. We still have room for maybe two more passengers plus trunk space for miscellaneous. I highly recommend trying an expedition if you have a large family like myself. It will not disappoint.
1528, a year ago,5,I like this car. I use it often at work. We have a few Ford Escapes on our motor pool. They are easy and simple to drive. They are spacious as well.
1529, a year ago,3,"I don't know what to say, I was a passenger in this car and the only thing that I think is that it was very comfortable and large. There was a lot of space on the back seats"
1530, a year ago,4,"Reliable car, great design and very ergonomic for the driver. Maintenance is cost effective, but some of the technology cuts in and out. Not great for taking calls over the speakers because of the background noise"
1531, a year ago,5,I absolutely love this car. It has great gas mileage and an awesome stereo system. It handles rain well and is an all around easy to drive car. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it in the end. I would recommend.
1532, a year ago,4,"I have a 2011 Ford Focus SE that I got in high school. It's barely had any issues with it and runs great still! I easily still have a few years left in it. I will say the body isn't holding up as well as the engine, it's rusting quite a bit, but that's my own fault as I don't have a garage to keep it in and I live in a four-season environment. "
1533, a year ago,5,"Este vehículo es cómodo para hacer viajes en familia incluso para ir a la montaña o ir recoger a los niños del colegio o simplemente ir al trabajo, es de todo andar"
1534, a year ago,4,"Rides smoothly and quick speed pickup. Down the road it gets multiple issues with the working parts and requires lots of repair, even while taking care of it."
1535, a year ago,5,"It’s a very good car is beautiful and very comfortable, al the versions are very luxury and you don’t need to spend so much money for have it, I recomend this car if you are a fancy person but you donde want to spend all your money in a car"
1536, a year ago,5,"Me encanta el interior es súper bonito y cómodo, aparte es amplió y por fuera es un automovil hermoso la verdad estoy feliz"
1537,a year ago,3,I had my Ford Focus for 2 years! My family had warned me not to get one because they had bas luck in the past with their Fords but I decided to give it a try. Everything was great right up until my transmission went. I had to get it rebuilt twice and the mechanic that was looking / working on my car told me that he has this issue alot with older model (early to mid 2000s) Ford sedans. I quickly traded in for a Nissan and havent looked back since.
1538, a year ago,5,So sporty and fast. Looks and wAs commonly mistaken for a luxury vehicle hit great miles was really sad to@part with this one
1539, a year ago,5,"I leased a fusion about 5 years ago, it was perfect for me at the time. It drove well in all weather conditions, i loved this car. It had a reasonable about of space in it. I wouldn’t recommended if you plan on having multiple children."
1540, a year ago,5,This ish is the bees knees. 100% would recommend to anyone. The color is great. And the drive is very smooth
1541, a year ago,4,Roomy for a mid sized vehicle. The visibility was difficult for me. It’s a trusted and safe vehicle.
1542, a year ago,3,Its okay. Quite small though. I prefer the hatchback version more. Better for fitting things in the back.
1543, a year ago,5,"Very good car, quick when you need it to be but still very good in mileage around city."
1544,a year ago,4,I love Ford vehicles but this is underwhelming due to lack of space. It's really very tight when you start adding carseat and toddler
1545, a year ago,3,"We have a 2007 Ford Focus, it’s not bad but I would like to upgrade to a newer car with better features"
1546, a year ago,5,"Reliable, great on gas, love the back up camera. Smooth turning system. Fits 3 boys comfortably in the backseat"
1547,a year ago,5,"I dont have my own car but its wonderful experience to share a ride with my good friends travelling from san ildefonso to makati wich is very far about 3 hours with traffic. During our travel i have observed the  car was so smooth to drive automatically. Nice experience i really wish to have one like ""FORD""someday when i got another job."
1548, a year ago,4,"Yes, the Ford Escape is a good compact SUV. It provides enough power for most driving situations, rides smoothly on most pavement, and has better handling than many of its rivals. The Escape is roomy, and it comes standard with several driver assistance features. On top of that, it has a very good predicted reliability rating, as well as one of the best safety scores in the class."
1549, a year ago,3,"Great little car over all, but a lot of these from 2012- have a problem with the clutch, mine included."
1550, a year ago,3,"I had an older ford explorer, and i really liked it. I could turn around in the smallest space. Now i have a newer one . I have to say i miss my old one."
1551,a year ago,5,"It is a comfortable, spacious and economical car. gives a feeling of comfort and tranquility to travel. it is my favorite!!!"
1552,a year ago,5,"It is a comfortable, spacious and economical car. gives a feeling of comfort and tranquility to travel. it is my favorite!!!"
1553, a year ago,5,I’ve driven the fusion sport and man that thing gets up there and goes! It had black leather and made me feel really cool driving it.
1554, a year ago,5,"Really nice, so much room for activities! The seats are very comfortable, and I felt safe riding and driving this car."
1555, a year ago,5,"ma voiture, je l’adore et très très bien comme voiture. La marque ford est une très bonne marque."
1556, a year ago,4,I do love my car has great trunk space but if you have a big family and kids are still in car seats I wouldn’t recommend this car if you have more than 2 kids in car seats . If you have 1 or 2 than it would be a good choice .
1557,a year ago,5,"I loved it. The front window is so big and crystal clear. It's a smooth drive, quiet. There are no cons. It's roomy. Make it go faster. Easy to maintain. It's quite adfordable. Great car if you have kids. I would recommend it to people with kids in sports or people that like to travel."
1558,a year ago,5,Es un automóvil muy cómodo y duradero lo se porque mi novio lo tuvo por mas de 5 años. con el viajamos muchísimo y funcionaba porque en su maletero entraba todo nuestro equipaje  
1559, a year ago,5,"My mom has this car and I love it! I love driving it and riding as a passenger. With her trim this is outside my price range, so I can’t speak to affordability (lower trim may be cheaper, idk) but it is a great car. She never has issues and getting service is easy."
1560, a year ago,1,If I could rate this car less than one star you better bet I would!! I had this car about 2 years before I had to buy 6 (yes SIX) new tires and the transmission went out! I got rid of this car when they had a recall on 2015 SE model! Never been so excited to go car shopping after this POS!!
1561,a year ago,4,"Okay so as I said previously I am not a Ford fan. Again the car rental agency gave this vehicle for me to drive. Now if I was going to buy a Ford vehicle, this would be the one I would choose. Spacious and great on gas like the focus, but this one has a smoother ride and more features that I like."
1562,a year ago,3,"I'm not a huge fan of Ford products, I am more of a Chevy fan. I only drove this car because it was what the car rental agency had available. I will give credit where it is due. The car was spacious and great on gas."
1563, a year ago,5,I love my car. It has all of the features you could ever want in a car! I love the color and how easy it is it maintain.
1564, a year ago,5,"Era ed è un'auto eccezionale nella sua semplicità. Prestazioni adeguate, consumi contenuti, affidabilità unica..140.000 km (lavori importanti : distribuzione e frizione. Stop). Mai un problema
 Nulla mi dispiace. Purtroppo oggi, essendo euro 3, è demonizzata...a tal proposito vorrei tanto sapere che ""euro"" sono le mega navi da crociera che quasi quotidianamente rilasciano nubi nere su Genova...poi il problema è la mia vecchia, affidabilissima ford
Comprata usata parecchi anni fa da un unico proprietario che l'aveva usata molto poco... fantastica"
1565, a year ago,3,"I test drive a lime green Fiesta at a Kia dealership and could feel my soul being taken away from me as soon as I turned the key. If you want good gas mileage, a bad back, and absolutely nobody to notice you, this is the car."
1566, a year ago,5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE my 2017 Ford Escape!!! I bought it over the past summer and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to buy a car. It has plenty of space, super easy to control and drive and sleek looking!"
1567,a year ago,4,"I purchased the 2015 Titanium model and have loved this vehicle since day one. Most of my driving is highway and have put just  over 100k miles on it. It’s handled well in all weather conditions and got great gas mileage up until recently. That being said, my transmission recently went out. I’ve religiously maintained the vehicle and Ford provides a pretty extensive warranty so I can’t give it a bad review. I would however think a transmission would last well over 100k miles especially in an established brand like Ford"
1568, a year ago,5,"Good looking and reliable. 
I really enjoy the look of this car, and you know it’s a reliable car for being a Honda, also affordable and cool looking. 
This is one car I would recommend to someone looking for a good lasting vehicle"
1569, a year ago,5,"Ford Focus is a reasonable price vehicle, it won’t brake your pocket. I owned a candy red Ford Focus back in the day. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone."
1570, a year ago,5,I rented this car it was a decent car. I would rent this vehicle again. It drove pretty well.
1571, a year ago,5,"Learnt how to drive in a fiesta, smooth drive. Easy to park and learn in. Had no problems with this."
1572, a year ago,4,Have been a passenger on one of these cars and have no complaints at all. Seems like a good car
1573, a year ago,3,This is a good car. I like suvs but I prefer a larger suv. I like all the color options. They have made so many improvements so I don’t see any need to make more. I would recommend for a small family.
1574, a year ago,3,"Good first vehicle, cheap car and doesnt hold its value. i have seen many issues arise over time mechanically. "
1575, a year ago,4,It's a nice small SUV. Not very much leg room in the back seat. I have a 2010 and when the ground is wet the tires will slip when you are taking off from a green light.  It has been in the shop to figure it out and no one can. My tires are brand new.
1576, a year ago,5,"Nice car, strong motor. Stable on road.
Definitely thinking to buy this car again. Bit expensive for me but is worth it"
1577,a year ago,4,"it so calm to go on a trip in this car, it’s so confortable and i love it, i would buy this"
1578, a year ago,5,"This is a very beautiful car with a nice, smooth ride, plus its extremely comfortable and gets great gas  mileage. Would definitely own one !!!"
1579, a year ago,3,I only give this a three star because it made me want to buy the Ford fusion which I gave a five star it wasn’t enough room but it was good on gas just to come back for me
1580, a year ago,4,We are on two of these this is a great family car good on gas last forever I have a 2010 and A 2020￼
1581, a year ago,5,We got my daughter this for her 18th birthday she loves it it’s a safe car and it has a big rearview mayor auto assist and safety features five star
1582, a year ago,4,This was a great vehicle and last I knew was still going strong at 200000 miles. Handled well
1583, a year ago,4,"Coche muy versátil sobre todo para la ciudad. 
Fácil manejo, fácil de aparcar e ideal para una escapada. Muy recomendable."
1584, a year ago,5,I own a 2009 Ford Fusion. It is the best car I have ever owned. I bought it used at a car auction and have owned it for 2 years now. The stereo doesn't work but I can deal with that.
1585, a year ago,5,Like this hybrid since it’s spacious but not too big. Affordable and good gas mileage. Trunk space is decent and works as an extra car for a family
1586, a year ago,3,"I was able to drive my cousin home from and urgent care, It was an alright ride. Was more concerned with her health than using the car"
1587, a year ago,5,"I had a 2000 Ford Focus that I got for dirt cheap from a guy in my neighborhood in 2010, only $600. , and it ran, and drove for a few years. It was the best little red speed racer ever. Zoom-zoom. Then, after driving it to death, still got $400. for it, junk value, even though they traveled quite a way to haul her away on a flat-bed. Blessed by God. I have developed a thing for Ford Focus, and hope to own, and drive some more of them in the future."
1588, a year ago,5,Great drive and very reliable car especially if you want great gas mileage it’s also a great starter vehicle
1589, a year ago,3,"Great for a first car. Back seats are cramped for someone over 5'3"". Nice handling. Seats aren't bad unless you are accustomed to luxury then they're on the cheap side. Affordable price wise."
1590,a year ago,5,I like it as it is a perfect car for everyone who don’t like “big” cars. Is very useful
1591, a year ago,4,"I had a 2005 Ford focus zx3 that I absolutely loved as it was my first car. It came without air-conditioning as it was the economy model, but I still loved it. I paid $650 and it lasted me 2 full years. I would recommend one to anyone looking for a reliable car that isn't gonna cost too much aside from oil changes, and other regular maintenance."
1592, a year ago,5,"THIS CAR IS THE BEST I EVER SIT IN.
And if you sit in like heaven😅. I dont know what the price is"
1593,a year ago,3,"It drives well and gets good gas milage. It also has basically no backseat. When I sit comfortably in the driver seat, the back of my seat touches the backseat. There is also a lack of cup holders and as someone that always has a drink on her, it is a travesty."
1594, a year ago,4,"Reliable and comfortable car. Personally I like to have more gadgets in my car and comfort features. Economical to run, insure and cheap on parts. Decent leg room and sized boot. Would consider buying one for myself if I had to cut down on my car spending"
1595, a year ago,5,"This is my third Ford Focus in a row, and I’m super happy with it. Great, reliable car. Easy to drive. A pleasure. And when you live in Los Angeles, you drive a lot. My car is like my office, and my second home. I love her."
1596, a year ago,4,This car is very nice. It’s comfortable and very easy to use. It’s not giving any problems.
1597, a year ago,5,"I've never been to a more spacious and comfortable car! If you haven't already, just give this car a shot!"
1598,a year ago,5,Prachtige auto rijdt werkelijk subliem alle wij hebben een focus 2019 st line en ikzelf heb geen op of aanmerkingen over deze auto alle lof voor onze dealer Boerhof Sappemeer  Ford Focus
1599, a year ago,5,(Ik heb rijles in deze auto) fijne besturing. Veel kleuze om stoel en stuur  goed te stellen. Fijn met schakkelen en optrekken.
1600, a year ago,3,"Innovative Sync system, very good fuel economy, plush ride quality, responsive steering, low price. Improve the budget interior materials, its affordable for me , i recommended!Ford Focus"
1601,a year ago,5,"I really love this car! It is very comfortable, spacious and has never failed. Has a lot of engine and fuel performance"
1602, a year ago,5,"I bought this car brand new and I fell in love with the 5 star safety rating first of all. It is easy to drive, easy to handle. Affordable, yes. I live it on long trips. Huge trunk! She’s a beauty too!"
1603, a year ago,4,"It’s GOOD, but my friend’s car was second hand and it has sometime damages 
But for those who have just obtained their driving license is really GOOD"
1604, a year ago,3,"Maybe it’s just my luck but I’ve had a handful of problems with my Escape- engine, coolant, and thermostat. I’m actually not too impressed but I do love how spacious the inside is and how easy it is with a child in the backseat. Overall, I wouldn’t buy this car again, but I’ll take what I can get."
1605, a year ago,2,Normal sedan for your everyday small family. Pretty nice on gas just not my type of car.
1606, a year ago,5,This was my sisters first car and it was a nice cute car. I enjoyed driving it when I was younger like teenage to young adult years.
1607, a year ago,3,"Perfect smaller sedan for economical driving. When you live for from most things, its best to have one."
1608,a year ago,4,Great car! Has all the room your will need .the cons of the car is it’s bad on gas to improve it I would have went with a different size motor tires etc
1609, a year ago,4,"È molto comoda ed ha un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Mi piace tantissimo la sua linea, riesce ad essere sempre elegante. Presenta tanti optional che la rende un vero e proprio gioiellino.  Il motore è silenzioso e la macchina ha un ottima tenuta di strada"
1610, a year ago,5,"La Ford Fiesta è una macchina che mi piace molto sia per il suo design che per le sue prestazioni.
È una macchina con una buona tenuta sulla strada ed offre tutti i comfort per viaggiare in comodità."
1611, a year ago,5,"Ottima macchina la adoro da hanno che la ho e non mi crea mai problemi  comoda e abbastanza spaziosa per una donna è  fantastica ,consuma poco e questo è  importante ottima macchina . Non cambiero mai ford ottima marca d'auto consiglio a tutti"
1612, a year ago,4,I love my mom car! It has plenty of room. I like being up high versus a car. I feel I can see well and the leather seats are fantastic with having a kid.
1613, a year ago,5,This little Moto got me from a to B for 10 years I love it and I’m sad that I had to give up
1614, a year ago,5,A fun drive really enjoyed it I was smooth I don’t have a problem with this car off this brand￼
1615, a year ago,2,I have had 3 recalls with my car so far. I am also in the process of a buy back for this car also. I have had the clutch patch replaced twice since purchasing it. It was also replaced by previous owner. The car was built with a faulty transmission. I love Ford but not the focus.
1616, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape!! I’ve had my SUV for 5 years now and have had no issues. It’s great on gas, super affordable and an awesome family vehicle!"
1617, a year ago,4,I think FORD is a good brand and I liked this ride really well. I think the car is still going strong and the seating room is great.
1618, a year ago,5,Wooo excelente calidad y mucha comodidad a para la familia me gusto mucho gracis por siempre darnos lo mejor
1619, a year ago,4,This car has been amazing. I have the 2014 lux addition and it has everything I need. This car gets me from A to B no problems. It was quite expensive but it is worth it to feel safe in my car.
1620, a year ago,5,This car is a good price and great car. I love all the safety things and technology you can have on it.
1621, a year ago,4,"I was a passenger in this SUV, I rode in the back row, I believe this is a 6 seat vehicle. It was a pleasant ride but I believe there needs to be a bit more leg room in the back row"
1622, a year ago,5,"Very comfortable car. Very spacious in the back seat with tons of leg room. Has a amazing sun roof, and trunk space and I love the affordability of this car."
1623, a year ago,3,"I have a 2004 she's starting to show her age :(. Drinking oil, always smells like she's overheating never actually does. Also has a misfire. But I love it for everyday errands and I can put the seats down an haul just about anything."
1624, a year ago,5,"I miss my Escape! Prior to switching over to the Fusion I had driven two different Escapes. I loved the trunk space, these cars got me through three moves! Payments were actually cheaper than those for my Fusion. If I could give this six stars I would!"
1625, a year ago,5,"This is my current vehicle, and as someone who was adamantly against cars, I was surprised with how much I loved it! It still has plenty of storage space, and the dealership worked with me to find a price that worked. Highly recommend!"
1626, a year ago,4,"It's a good basic car. I drove it for 7 years, then passed it on to my son. He's still driving it 3 years later. It's not luxury, but we've had relatively few issues with it. It's not overly comfortable, and the back seat is extremely tight. However, for just one or 2 people, it's perfect!"
1627, a year ago,5,We will always be loyal customers to ford. We have owned them for years and have always had superb experiences. Customer service is amazing and the quality is unmatched. I absolutely love my expedition and recommend Cleburne Tx Ford to everyone!
1628, a year ago,5,"Great car, seating position on one I drove as a company car was somewhat awkward but I might have been due to it being a base model. Overall I think the escape is more stylish and a better value than almost any other suv including the smaller Ford ECO Sport."
1629, a year ago,3,Ive never been in this type of vehicle but it looks like a nice car that would be reliable on gas and transportation
1630, a year ago,1,"One of the worst car purchases I’ve made to date, and I’ve made plenty. This thing left me stranded more times than I could count, and it was brand new! During the months I owned the car, there were multiple recalls, the car would start whenever it wanted to, and the tow truck dude and I were on a first name basis. Let’s just say it lived part-time at the  dealership’s Service Department and they never could figure out what was wrong with it. On the bright side, I did get to test a lot of rental cars during that time. After about six month of living on the edge I traded it in for an Explorer and haven’t looked back since."
1631, a year ago,4,my first car and i love it. the inside is so roomy and nice. had my car for a couple years now and it’s still looks brand new
1632,a year ago,3,"Not my favorite car to drive, had to do a lot of work on this car to maintain it. The ride is smooth, but i don't like how low to the ground i sat. Although it does get fantastic milage. I didn't have my focus very long before I returned to Toyota."
1633, a year ago,5,I have to say that this car like a passenger is great but my boyfriend that own it always have the same complain that for the hills is too slow and hard to drive.In time of rains I think is a little to short
1634, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Focus. It gets fantastic mileage, drives smoothly, and can fit in any parking space."
1635, a year ago,3,I’m not a massive fan the Ford Focus but it did drive well and was great on gas. Was a great for my long distance drive.
1636, a year ago,5,I love my fiesta!! It’s awesome on gas and has a lot of trunk space. The back seat isn’t very roomy but that’s the only complaint I have about my fiesta. I’ve taking it on tons of roads trips and have never had any issues out of it
1637, a year ago,5,"I bought this car for my son. It’s safe, reliable , a d good on gas mileage. My son loves his car."
1638, a year ago,5,I love my Escape. I wish it had better gas mileage but I love everything else about it.
1639, a year ago,5,This is my first car. I’ve had it for 6 years and it is still in great condition. It is reliable and durable as well as safe. I would recommend
1640, a year ago,5,Dog collars.. what's a fiesta? Explorers are popular... Anyway. I love my ford it's a 2014 I want the 2019 it's Ruby Red.. I hate Red but this car whispered something sexy in my ear so... I bought it.. still paying it off.. but even though the payments suck I LOVE IT
1641, a year ago,5,I was raised a Ford kid so there isn't anything I can really say bad about them.m from the company to the cars. the escape is my favorite by far. it not big not to small and gets great mileage
1642, a year ago,5,"I do love my car. I bought her used with less than 20,000 miles but she still runs like she’s brand new. Easy to clean and the steering is nice and tight which Is what I’d prefer. My friends and I are always comfortable when we ride around on late nights and the mileage is great"
1643,a year ago,4,I am not a fan of ford cars. I like ford trucks more. Ford cars seem to have something wrong with them all of the time/
1644, a year ago,3,My biggest complaint with the Ford Focus is the size. For those that like compact cars the Ford Focus is an excellent choice.
1645, a year ago,4,"Puede que cumpla sus expectativas de un buen auto, si sabe de autos y de interiores y Exteriores de estos son duda no se arrepentira de esta gran inversión puede que tenga más gamas de color y diversas funciones, puedo recomendar esta gran marca de automóviles."
1646, a year ago,5,"Super nice car. We had this before trading in for a bigger family vehicle. It’s an affordable luxury car, in my opinion. It’s a great car, we just needed more space for our family. Great gas mileage."
1647, a year ago,3,"It's an OK car i do own this one drives OK buy has many problems with it.  It still runs after 300,000, miles"
1648, a year ago,5,I own a 2017 Ford Fusion energi. Great on gas mileage with it being hybrid and able to plug it in to just use battery. Fill up gas maybe every 3 months. I plug in every other day. Great car and like the drive in it.
1649, a year ago,5,"I have a 2005 Ford Focus hatchback and we bought it used in November 2019 for $300 and it’s been an amazing car. It’s great on gas. We’ve only had to fix it twice; very minor issues. Plus,we also bought rims about 6mths in,however that was due to my husband hitting a huge pothole and it bent the rim.I really have no complaints on the actual efficiency of the car. Except for the inside on the door panels the details on the doors are coming off but I guess for being 15yrs old that isn’t so bad. Plus the handle to roll the window down,broke just yesterday 10-4-2020.😏 Overall my fiancé and I are extremely satisfied."
1650, a year ago,5,i love my car it has so many good things about the way it drives and the way it takes very little time to put breaks on and just to keep it up 
1651, a year ago,5,Absolutely love our Ford. We've used it to travel across the country and back with no problems. It fits our 2 carseats and German Shepherd with room to spare. The leather air conditioned ane heated seats are my favorite part. Definitely a good option for moms who don't want to drive a mini van but still need space.
1652,a year ago,5,This is my second brand new Ford Focus I have owned and let me say I am very pleased. My last Focus I had for 14 years and it was still running great when I sold it. All we ever do is keep up with maintenance  and we haven’t had any major issues. Love my Ford. I would definitely recommend this car for anyone. Did I mention the trunk is HUGE!!! Love it. 
1653, a year ago,4,Good car haven't had a lot of problems with it. It gets decent gas mileage it also has a lot of room.  Pros its roomy cons could get better gas mileage. I Would rate this a good family car.The older years are not expensive.  I would recommend this type of car
1654, a year ago,5,"I adore my Focus!  It handles well, great on gas, has a smooth ride, and is everything I want in a car!  Has a backup camera and sunroof as well."
1655, a year ago,5,I love this car. It was a scary purchase since it was my fist new car but I do not regret it since it is a great car at a great price especially compared Tom the other car brands.
1656, a year ago,5,I love this car. Being a college student it is a perfect size and provides me with all of the features I need.
1657,a year ago,5,"Nice quality interior, overall appearance is great and appealing to the eye compared to previous years and the boxier looking models."
1658, a year ago,5,I really wanted this car but it’s known to have problems with the engine. It’s a nice car but I wouldn’t recommend this car.
1659,a year ago,4,This car is used to travel back and forth to work. It has great gas mileage and has really made us save on fuel expense.
1660, a year ago,5,"I loved my Escape. Wonderful, smooth driving vehicle and was very roomy and cost effective. It drove beautifully."
1661, a year ago,3,I'm not a car expert but this is comfortable and fast. Seems easy to drive and it does not ask for too much. I don't own one but I've driven one
1662, a year ago,4,"This is a really nice car. I know a lot of the features are essentially considered standard now, but it is a very smooth drive also. The gas mileage is great! I have only owned it for a few months but it seems worth it. I would recommend this car for anyone looking for a smooth daily commute with great gas mileage."
1663, a year ago,5,I was given a Ford Fusion to drive for 30 days after an accident in my vehicle. It drove like a dream and had all the bells and whistles
1664, a year ago,5,Ford Escape I love my Ford Escape!! It’s a older model 2008! I’m a single mom so I could afford anything newer!! I’m hoping in the next few years I’ll be able to get a newer Ford!! I’m a little nervous for winter though because my Escape is not four wheel drive! Hopefully it will make it threw Wisconsin winters!! #ilovemyford
1665, a year ago,5,"Very cool, comfortable and used for a long time Strong and family I loved it I recommend buying it"
1666, a year ago,2,"Personally, the only thing I like about this car is the size and shape/space of this car. I live in FL and when the A/C get warm and needs to cool down the vents close! Not cool! Literally, especially in FL. Also, as a women you know we all love having extra storage space to put things and this car provides just the center console and glove compartment. I do not recommend this car! Sorry!"
1667, a year ago,4,"I have been a passenger in a Ford Fiesta, I love the inside of a Ford Fiesta it’s so modern and easily to use with your phone and I have heard it is cheap too"
1668, a year ago,5,"One of my top favorite cars. I believe mine was an 07. She was a perfect little car for me, great gas milage and super safe. My son and I were in a really bad accident and completely totalled the car. My son had not even a scratch and I had a bruise from the seat belt. The responders and even my husband who's a fire fighter couldn't believe we walked away from the accident, specially with barely even a scratch. The focus is a must have on my list."
1669,a year ago,2,Vehicle has a nice looking body style. That is why i did not rate it a 1. The Vehicle is not made for a tall person or family. I felt like I was a sardine smashed in a can. Because my head was almost touching roof. Even when my drivers seat was not all the way back. My 7 year olds knees were touching the back seat.
1670, a year ago,5,So this is the second Ford Fusion I’ve purchased. The last ones motor blew up because I didn’t take care of it. It broke my heart and I actually went out and bought the exact same care same color only 2 years newer. Who does that? Lol
1671,a year ago,3,It is not a brand that I like very much but they have nice cars. Is a good things and but things but is expensive the service
1672, a year ago,4,Ford Motor Company it's so cool looking.i have never driven but experienced a long drive in this car. It was so comfortable and made my journey easy.
1673,a year ago,5,"I have had two Ford Fiestas in my life and I can say that they are my top make of car, they last and last, and you can fix them! unlike the new one's, the only thing I would improve is the boot need to make it a bit bigger, I would always go for ford as my top carmaker."
1674,a year ago,5,"I love my car it is black metallic, cleans up well every time, comfy, can just the seats in lots of ways, pros easy to drive it cuts the engine at lights it has air conditioning, very clear dashboard, it is one of the more affordable cars on the market, worth every penny."
1675,a year ago,4,"I really love the ford fiesta car, they are so great for new drivers. I really like the fact that the biting point is so easy to feel with this car making it more comfortable to drive!"
1676, a year ago,3,"It was a decent car, but not a ford fan and would never buy a ford. I've found that ford does not make cars that handle Canada's harsh winters"
1677, a year ago,4,"My experience with  Ford Motor Company has not been that great honestly. I have had a few ford vehicles, and atleast 2 out of 3 ended up having transmission problems. They are expensive to work on or buy replacement parts for as well. I would only recommend them for those who can afford alot of maintenance for them."
1678, a year ago,4,I had the car as a rental and I loved it! Its very sleek and clean and has a ver roomy trunk. If I didn't have two kids in car seats then I would definitely trade in for this car.
1679, a year ago,5,I’ve rented this car many times this is absolutely one of my favorite cars. They drive very fast and handle very well. It comes stocked with a lot of features and Ford is a great American brand !!!
1680, a year ago,5,We own a  Ford F350 dually and  5thbwheel. The truck is a diesel and work horse not to mention so comfy as a passenger.
1681, a year ago,4,The very first car that I purchased on my own was a Ford Focus. I put alot if mileage on it because I lived away from home at the time. It was sturdy and really never had any issues with it. Grwt first car!
1682, a year ago,5,I looooove this car. I needed something small with good gas mileage and safety features and I definitely hit the jackpot. This car is so comfortable and easy to drive. Maintenance and working on it is easy too!
1683, a year ago,5,"Love the drive the fusion gives you, along with the bells and whistles it come with."
1684, a year ago,4,I love my car it’s small and compact but definitely won’t be ideal with kids. It’s my first brand new car and my dealership was 5 stars as well this whole experience was great.
1685, a year ago,5,I love this car my mom has one and it’s very roomy and spacious. I love everything about it
1686, a year ago,4,The car was a great choice to buy. It has a comfortable seating. It gives a good milage.  The car pick up was good .
1687,a year ago,4,I love ford . I have never driven a car. But in future would love to. After some years I would buy a car in this brand which I hope for.
1688,a year ago,4,"Roomy enough for 2 carseats in the back and have enough leg room in the front. Great gas mileage. Phone calls through Bluetooth are usually crystal clear, which is great. Drives very smoothly. Takes bumps pretty good. It is really low though, so you may scrape the front bumper at times."
1689, a year ago,5,I absolutely love this car. It drives amazing and it has all of the features I want or could possibly need. I definitely will be driving this til it dies which I hope won’t be for a long time
1690, a year ago,3,"My Ford Fusion is pretty reliable. It gets great gas mileage and it’s never broken down in the 3 yrs since I bought it used. It was pretty expensive, going back I would have gotten something practical for a cheaper price."
1691, a year ago,4,Nice car but I upgraded from a 2013 Ford Focus to a 2018 in the year of 2018 and my edition was more a downgrade. I lost certain features I had in my 2013 and a transmission issue I had then that the warranty always covered seems to still be an issue with my 2018. The car shakes upon take off and hesitates. When I purchased my car back then I’d hoped that I’d have the car at least to pass down to my son later on but I have a feeling I’ll have to purchase again for a more reliable car.
1692, a year ago,4,"Fine, functional but in no way an exciting or head turning vehicle.  Fine for a commuter or rental car.  A good starter for a new drivers first car, if you are fortunate enough to start with a new car!"
1693, a year ago,5,"This car is amazing. My fiancé has the 2008 one in blue and Although it did die it lasted so long! 150,00 miles in until we had problems with it. That’s a lot for a car and it’s FAST. Love it and would recommend"
1694, a year ago,3,"My moms car growing up was a 2003 Ford Focus. I hated the damn thing, it felt claustrophobic as hell and when I started to learn to drive it had awful visibility. Despite all this my mom did continue to drive that car for 10-15 years before it went kaput."
1695,a year ago,4,"I have an 08 Ford Escape, so it is older, but I love it! It’s a fantastic car for my family and I!"
1696, a year ago,4,I liked this little car. It was a work vehicle that i had to use 8 hours a day. We had the hybrid version so of course I wasn’t used to it so it was such a quiet drive.
1697, a year ago,4,I liked the space of this car. It held many passengers. Not many cons in this car. I wouldn’t really improve much on this car.
1698, a year ago,5,"I honestly don’t like fords even though I drive one I regret it! It’s been a great car I own a 2004 so it’s a lot older it was rebuilt I have had to change my alternator 4 times since 2019 and I’ve had it for 5years the gas mileage is great I haven’t even hit 200,0000 yet! Other than having to change a few things over and over it’s been a really good car but it’s way to small for me and my kids!"
1699, a year ago,5,"This is the best motor company. I drive a 2008 Ford Edge limited and it has over 230,000 miles on  it. This has been a great car. It has been everywhere.
I would highly recommend getting a car from this motor company."
1700, a year ago,4,"Great gas mileage.  Don't have a tire blow out because the car is made cheap.  Otherwise,  Good little car."
1701, a year ago,5,I have a 2018 fusion and love it.  I love the heated leather seats. I love the back up camera.  Great gas mileage.
1702,a year ago,5,"Absolutely love this car! Ford girl for life. Ford cars are reliable, easy to maintain and can definitely last you a long time! Had my first Ford car for over 10 years!"
1703,a year ago,3,Ok little car but a bit rickety on the road I dont rate the suspension could be vastly improved also steering was a bit heavy I found.
1704, a year ago,5,My brother has a ford fusion & the car is really nice. Its got a sleek design & spacious interior. Its got ample trunk space as well. He has had it for 2 yeara & He loves it!
1705,a year ago,5,"Service parfait, agréable, simpatique, gentil. Merci beaucoup pour votre accueil et vos conseils. Je recommande en plus excellente voiture !"
1706, a year ago,3,"The Ford Focus is a smaller car that handles well, until I got on the highway. The car I had didn't have power to get out of the way. I did check out the Ford Fusion, a bit larger but you'll also pay more. 

Gas mileage for the money is good. Not a bad vehicle for non highway driving. Good hand me down car for younger drivers.  Ford Focus"
1707, a year ago,5,Es un Carro Excelente!. Es cómodo y puede ocupar hasta 5 personas. Económico en uso y gasto de Gasolina. No tiene Muerte!! Las piezas de remplazo son Económicas y Facil de adquirir.
1708, a year ago,5,Same as before never had a issue with this car rides smooth and great car to do anything in
1709, a year ago,5,Great car runs smooth and has the kick like most fords do never had an issue with the car
1710, a year ago,5,"I have had my focus for almost 9 years and it is still going strong! and knock on wood, but I have not had any issues with it besides your normal routine maintenance of oil changes, tires, and breaks. literally the most reliable vehicle I know of "
1711, a year ago,4,"Got to drive a Fusion and I must say, for a FORD it was a pretty good experience. I really enjoyed how comfortable and modern the interior was. The car itself is so sleek on the outside. Reminds of of a well defined athlete or a super model. It actually has a bit of get up and go to, which I was not expecting. The simplicity of the controls and the smoothness of the drive almost made me feel like I was cheating on my Jeep. Probably the only Ford I’d ever actually spend my money on!"
1712, a year ago,3,I purchased a focus the first year they came out. It was a great car that took me across the country several times and numerous road trips. When they relaunched them with that weird manual/automatic transmission they were unsafe. It’s too bad they didn’t do well and have quit making them.
1713, a year ago,2,"It was a fun little car, but the transmission was out of wack. It was a manual transmission that shifts automatically thus it operates like an automatic. We had some scary moments in that car when the transmission would drag. I don’t think they make them anymore, and there is a good reason why."
1714, a year ago,4,The Fusion has been fantastic regarding gas mileage. We took a cross-country trip and clocked 50 miles per gallon on the interstate. That is better than the Focus and Fiesta I have driven. My only complaint is that things have already started falling apart inside.
1715, a year ago,5,I remember the first year these came out! I loved the size....the look.....great gas mileage... everything! I loved everything about it. Looked at several to purchase. Very nice sized for a smaller family.
1716, a year ago,5,"This was my first ever car. I loved her and she was my people monster, she was very very old but she got me from A to B and obviously everyone has that first car that was rickety and slow but she did me proud. The inside was fine, outside was fine, engine was fine. All round just a solid car!"
1717, a year ago,5,￼Lots of room leather seats which make clean up easy great gas mileage smooth ride back up camera
1718,a year ago,5,"My dad has a fusion.  I love it. It's red but it changes in different light. Runs great, never a problem.  It had so many gadgets inside. It's great"
1719, a year ago,4,The car drives very smooth I really like it it’s very roomy perfect for small families I don’t think I would improve this product in anyway it’s pretty affordable and I definitely recommend to everyone
1720, a year ago,5,"Great car! My father is on his second one as he likes to change the colour whenever he likes! Very smart, so reliable and high tech now! Smooth to drive and comfortable! Definitely affordable!"
1721, a year ago,4,"It is comfortable, spacious, has a family version and with an affordable price for the economy of a family that is normally what this car is for, personally, it has given me very good service"
1722,a year ago,4,Drove easy! Nice gears! Safety was good and costumer service was alright! Nice as first car
1723, a year ago,4,Very good family car. Have an ‘11 and only thing bad is back seats are a bit cramped but I’ve been told new models are more spacious
1724, a year ago,2,Such a terrible car!! It will always break down on you trust and believe me on that. Worst car I ever drove and am happy that I’m no longer driving.
1725, a year ago,4,Good truck rides good very roomy didn't take any special fluids made in America so can find parts easy and are fairly priced
1726, a year ago,3,"While I’ve had my car for about 8 years, it’s bf issues since day 1. It’s varied from wiring issues to recall notices but even when getting something fixed, I find myself back with another issue only months later. This car was great during college days but I wouldn’t recommend keeping it passed 4-5 years."
1727, a year ago,5,"Carro econômico,motor meio fraquinho mais super econômico, temos ele a 6anos gostamos muito do nosso veículo"
1728, a year ago,5,"I have a Ford Fusion Titanium. It’s a lot of fun to drive. There are a ton of nice features, too. I am a huge fan of the backup camera."
1729, a year ago,3,"The gas mileage was great, but maintenance was frequent, and if you don’t know how to navigate under the hood, it can be confusing because of how messy the wiring is."
1730,a year ago,4,I think it's the most reliable car that I have ever had lasted me till the wheels came off not literally but till it took a s☆☆☆ but I loved my escape very much so and with my family growing I loved that I still had room with two carseats but all in all great car for me
1731, a year ago,5,"WONDEFUL EXPERIENCED, LOOKS A LITTLE CLASSY AND OLD MODEL STILL HAD THE VERY BEST EXPERIENCE. THE CAR IS SUITABLE FOR FAMILY AND ALSO SINGLE, GOT BOTH THE LOOKS. THE FUSION OF THE CAR IS EXTREMELY SATISFACTORY AND ENJOY FULL. ONE SHOULD BUY ONE"
1732, a year ago,5,Vey light weight car. Feels like you’re not in it! Great on gas! Very good started car for young adults
1733, a year ago,5,LOVE THIS CAR! It’s very “luxurious” but without big tag! Heated seats even the older models are packed with great features!
1734,a year ago,1,I have had so many issues with the 2014 Focus. I have had the clutch replaced three times in the last 4 years.
1735, a year ago,5,"It drives so smooth and has so many nice features. It fits my little family quite comfortably. After getting this, I have a hard time driving my husbands car lol"
1736, a year ago,4,No longer have this car but it’s one of my favorite cars great on gas drive smoothly I would highly recommend a food escape

Hybrid version is back after a prolonged absence
Improved power and acceleration
Kicks off the fourth Escape generation"
1738, a year ago,5,Runs well no major issues only minor issues. It's a 2006. It has a few dents. 240 k miles still going strong. 
1739, a year ago,5,"Family friendly & has GREAT mileage! I was never a ford driver until my escape and I truly love this car. It’s spacious and quite affordable, especially for the features of the car, would definitely recommend!"
1740,a year ago,5,A very comfirtable and nice looking car with plenty of leg room. A nice big boot and a nice looking car. Very nippy and lots of room
1741, a year ago,3,My grandparents own this vehicle and I enjoy driving it every once in a while. For my taste I don't like Fords as much.  
1742, a year ago,5,i absolutely love this car. my grandma has it and i drive it every chance i can. the radio is really nice and has many features that could be helpful. like driver assistance and alerts to keep you in your lane. seats are comfy and drives amazing
1743, a year ago,5,took this car for a couple test drives during ford testing and absolutely loved it. not too small of a car but drives very smoothly. interior is nice and has many great luxuries. definitely a car that can take a harsh driver
1744, a year ago,5,I rented a car from Budget about 9 months ago for a short road trip. It was surprisingly awesome. I am typically a Chevy girl but I was impressed with this Taurus.
1745,a year ago,5,"So nice. Love the interior, drives nice and like the lights inside the car. A con is almost everyone has one. I would improve by making them different colors and they’re expensive but would recommend."
1746, a year ago,5,I wanted this car so much when I was younger my step mother use to let me drive all the time. It rides very smooth and gets up in speed these cars are affordable and great I love it
1747, a year ago,5,I drove a rental from Florida to Colorado. The best ride I’ve ever taken. The car has so many features.
1748, a year ago,5,"This was our dream car.  When we were in an accident and it was totaled, it’s sturdy construction saved our lives."
1749, a year ago,4,Beautiful design all over easy to drive an navigate all the controls my stepson has one and it's amazing on fuel.
1750, a year ago,5,cute clean body lines easy to maintain and a great car for the price. perfect little cars for young kids just learnt to drive.
1751, a year ago,5,Beautiful car. Nice handling and I love the safety features my daughter currently drives a 2016 and the car has never needed a mojor repair and is easy to maintain.
1752, a year ago,5,My mother has this car and has been driving Ford Escapes for over 20 years. She has the 2020 Ford Escape currently and we love how sleek the car is. It has amazing views with the full moon roof.
1753, a year ago,4,"Amazing! But has very limited space, not very much to say, doesn’t waste gas as much as other cars and very affordable"
1754, a year ago,5,Nice car all around. Good reliable car. Great on gas     It’s spacious. Nice for beginners.
1755, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Focus. It has leather interior, heated seats, AC, Bluetooth, maps and a few other cool features. It’s a hatchback and it’s perfect for me. I get about 30mpg which is great because I commute a bit to work. I would have never imagine getting to own a Ford"
1756, a year ago,4,Perfect for students or couples. This cars are affordable and gas economic. Low maintenance and decent look. Comfy interiors.
1757, a year ago,5,Considero que es buena línea desde que lo compre jamás ha fallado y me gusta mucho su estilo
1758, a year ago,4,"The only complaint I gave is the trunk. There’s no lip so the contents fall out if the trunk, I’ve lust a lot of milk from this. It’s a smooth ride Greg is comfortable with lighting inside that I can change color."
1759,a year ago,2,I’m not much of a ford person. Great gas mileage. Looks decent. Interior is comfortable but cheap looking.
1760, a year ago,4,"I used to drive a Ford F-150 King Ranch edition truck. It was my baby. The issues I had were with the air conditioner mostly. At one point the engine would just turn off in the middle of me driving (very scary) and I would have to pull over, turn the key off, open the door and wait about 3 minutes before it would start again. Sometimes that happens every 10 minutes and sometimes it wouldn't happen for weeks at a time. It was a 2013 and my dad used it to drive to work (about 80 miles one way) and I took it to college since it was paid for. I would buy one again just because I loved mine but I would make sure the one you buy hasn't had any kinds of issues. Mine also had close to 300,000 miles on it, which is never great!"
1761, a year ago,5,"Nicest car I have ever been owned. Excellent performance, front wheel drive even drove great in winter conditions. Ford did a great job of making an affordable car feel luxury. I have the titanium model and I would definitely recommend to anyone."
1762,a year ago,2,I am not fond of anything build and made by Ford. I've had such bad luck with this brand. Transmissions going out among other big dollar issues. I can not recommend a Ford product.
1763, a year ago,5,"This is a very robust car, she drives like a dream,once in side it’s so quiet,the boot space is huge as it has a double boot , great on diesel,totally 
Reliable,love it ."

1768, a year ago,5,This car is very good brand is highly recommended For people who like to walk and go on a trip it's fabulous for that wonderful design and aesthetics leaves me in a marvel
1769, a year ago,4,"I am always a passenger and have driven my partners Ford Fiesta. I think it’s personal a bit big for my liking, I love smaller cars and compared to my little one it feels massive! It is great value for money and they do last a long time. It’s always a smooth drive and never any issues with breakdowns etc..."
1770, a year ago,1,These cars have all types of problems. Not to mention how insanely expensive it is to get the smallest things fixed! I don’t think there’s anyway to improve this unless the company lowers the prices on their cars.
1771, a year ago,3,It was a rental so it was okay to get around in. The size allowed me to park in some pretty tight spots. I wasn't spending alot on gas cause I only drove to my kids school work then home.
1772, a year ago,1,"Car was okay and looked good, but the worst seats I have ever sat in. I drive a lot for work (sales) and back became so bad I had to seek medical treatment. Back specialist asked if driving made it worse and then asked, “you don’t perhaps drive a fusion do you?” When I said yes, he said number one car for back trouble in the UofM system.  Had to sell and get another brand."
1773, a year ago,3,"My first car! Small, safe and reliable! Always reminds me of a student’s car when i see one!"
1774, a year ago,4,"I feel ford in general are cheap, cheerful and reliable! The focus is lots of people’s first car for that reason!"
1775, a year ago,5,This is my baby!! I used to have one when I started driving and it was an absolute unit.
1776, a year ago,2,My escape had a motor problem within the first year so I upgraded to a ranger and this year I got the ford F 150 and I couldn’t be happier with my upgrade
1777, a year ago,4,"This is my husband's and I would never have purchased it   I had a Land Rover Discovery: in comparison, the Escape has horse power that isn't so great.  The ride is not smooth and does not take bumps and road work well.  It is great off road.
My husband's next vehicle will probably be a Range Rover."
1778, a year ago,5,"I love my car so much! It’s the perfect size. Not too big, but it can hold a lot!! It’s perfect for vacations and it’s very roomy and still small enough to easily park."
1779, a year ago,4,"The journey by this car was a comfortable, modern and safe car.
Negative - the car has a low chassis."
1780, a year ago,5,Love it but it would always have something that needed fixing.. we had to trade it in cuz it was to much
1781,a year ago,4,"Lows Cheap interior on base models, rough-edged base three-cylinder engine, high starting price. Verdict With a car-like design and driving demeanor, decent interior room, the Ford Escape is a solid mid-pack compact SUV, but several others do the job better."
1782,a year ago,4,"There was a time when all Focus models had advanced independent rear suspension, but now the 1.0 petrol and 1.5 diesel get a slightly cheaper set-up. With this more advanced suspension fitted, the Focus is a joy to drive. In fact, it's the best family car to drive full stop. Ford Focus Ford Motor Company"
1783,a year ago,5,"The Ford Fusion he Ford Fusion is a good midsize car. It provides composed handling and a smooth ride, and its cabin has plenty of space across two rows of comfortable seats. It has a large trunk, and many of the infotainment features are easy to use."
1784,a year ago,5,"Es un auto compacto, recomendable para una familia pequeña o una sola persona, es cómodo y tiene el espacio ideal necesario"
1785,a year ago,5,"Cumple ampliamente con su función, en lo personal me gusta el espacio y lo lujoso que es por dentro, es cómodo, ideal para una familia pequeña"
1786,a year ago,5,"We’ve been a Ford family for a VERY long time. I’m on my third F-150 (only because I lease) I love the 2.7L Ecoboost! Plenty of power, rows great! The esthetics of the truck are great, the interior, the tech of the trucks are top notch! I will always drive Ford."
1787, a year ago,5,One of the best cars I've had yet. Its big enough for just growing family and some. If I had to purchase another  vehicle I would definitely get another
1788,a year ago,4,My mom’s car!! She’s been driving a Ford Focus for 10 years and it stills work perfectly.
1789, a year ago,4,Very small for my stature. I would say that this car has a lot of amenities and is very good on gas. Just to small for long legs to drive comfortably
1790, a year ago,5,One of the most comfortable car I have ever driven. The look and feel of the interior is wk derail. Easy to drive peppy on the horsepower
1791,a year ago,5,Loved this car when I had it. When I was buying a new car I didn’t like design of the interior of the year I was looking to buy.
1792, a year ago,5,Had this car for a couple months and it was great I loved the Apple car play it came with making it easier to drive
1793, a year ago,5,I don't know much about this vehicle as I was only in it for a few minutes.. I've been looking at different vehicles to eventually purchase a new car or truck soon..
1794,a year ago,5,I love my car and I’m so happy with my purchase! It’s definitely the perfect vehicle for me
1795, a year ago,3,"The car itself is nice for a new car. However the transmission sucks. No matter how much gas is in the car, my car hesitates and shakes when I accelerate from a stop. Once and a while it stalls and doesn't turn on the first time I try to start it. However everything else is pretty good"
1796,a year ago,4,Had a chance to drive this whenever I had wrecked my other car! Great car to drive I didn’t like it it was a little small for but I guess I had to get used to it! I drove a big suv so that’s probably why it felt so different!
1797,a year ago,5,"Ford makes the best kinds of cars for everyone! I do recommend these, great on gas mileage and everything! Great starter car for teens!"
1798, a year ago,2,Great on gas and very easy to drive but seems always have break issues and just overall mechanical issues.
1799, a year ago,5,"Very nice car to drive, very comfortable. Nice interior and comfortable seats. If I could improve this product I would suggest a different shape. And it is very affordable for a first car. I would recommend."
1800, a year ago,1,"I drove one of these for work and it was terribly uncomfortable. My feet and legs would go to sleep or cramp when going for more than an in town trip.  It is useless if you go anywhere near snow because it's not made with a big enough wheel well to accommodate tire chains.  The sensors would randomly trip so I wasted time and money having them checked... it's not like I could just ignore it in case it really did have an issue.  
The cabin is tiny and can fit a toddler in the back, but definitely not an adult.  
 was going to give it two 🌟 when I started writing the review but the more I wrote, the less I was feeling like it should get a second star.  
The only reason it  would have gotten the second star was gaa mileage, but I spent more having it checked out (time is $$) than I saved.  I was so glad when that car went away!"
1801, a year ago,4,Interesting take on a fusion vehicle cheap and great safety on it but it is a pain to maintenance parts are ridiculously priced and not very convertible as say my f150 being fusion of course it needed more ride coverage for smoother ride and was nice as far as materials i think its one of the better low cost fords on the markets for quality
1802, a year ago,5,Great valueble clothing an affordable sometimes pricey but is great material yes they can improve always
1803, a year ago,5,Great SUV. We had one for years and it was perfect. We did have to use premium gas for the model we had
1804,a year ago,5,Ford is a wonderful car that can go on top of Hills go on top of anything and there are wonderful tires and nice colours of the cars I love the seat textures and and I recommend this to anyone who needs a proper car this car is really fast and then gives a hundred out of a hundred
1805, a year ago,5,Great safety features and phenomenal gas mileage for a car as roomy and comfy and capable as the ford fusion surprised me by being!
1806, a year ago,4,"Great ride, value on gas. A bit small for long travel trips. Overall I enjoyed the car for the rental use."
1807, a year ago,5,I love the fact that it has heated seats. It also has a crash feature. I love the fact that it has more than 4 controls. It’s affordable it’s not that expensive. Yes I would definitely recommend this product.
1808, a year ago,1,Just not afford person not very reliable although very easy to change your oil OK on gas mileage but just not personally my favorite
1809, a year ago,5,I have a Ford escape it is roomy. I can transport 5 people comfortably and still have room for baggage or groceries.
1810,a year ago,2,"Smaller, less expensive Ford cars are known as ""Throw Away"" cars. They are not meant to last over 5-6 years. After that, you start replacing parts, and it will nickle and dime you to death."
1811, a year ago,5,We love our ford cars! Since 2015 we just use #ford from #Grieco store in #Fort #Lauderdale if you go can ask for #Mike #Tayson the best sales person to help you a chose a car for you! Ford Motor Company #ford #fusion Ford Fusion #2015 #2017 #edge #2019 #cars #truck
1812, a year ago,5,This escape is so great in snow!  It is just big enough for comfort but not too big.  I love the package i got with heated seats and 4wd.   bought it used and it has been a great car.  It is affordable and there are plenty of incentives with ford dealerships for maintenance help. 
1813, a year ago,5,Love this car! Would recommend to anyone! Great on gas! A great car for traveling! A few things I would change on this car would be little things
1814, a year ago,3,not my favourite dealer but the ride was smooth and the interior was roomy. It used to be a nice big SUV but they've changed the style and it looks like every other car on the road these days.  I like a bigger body with the extra room in the trunk
1815, a year ago,5,This car is amazing and has good gas milage and is amazing it is little and compact which is good because you don’t really need a big first car anyways
1816,a year ago,5,I have driven my mom’s escape a few times and I absolutely love it!! The cool tech features are so incredible in them and they drive so well! I heard they use to be just okay to drive and broke down a lot but i’ve been pleasantly surprised with the 2019 model. It’s a very smooth drive when you’re in them and backing up is pretty good for a big car! The one I wish ford would do is put the cooling seat options in all their cars because it is THE best feature lol. #InfluensterAwards2020
1817, a year ago,5,This was the cheapest car I have ever bought. It was fully loaded and a true luxury car if you’re looking for something small. Never had any problems with this vehicle. Drove smooth and lasted me a long time I’d still have it if it wasn’t for someone rear ending me.
1818, a year ago,4,Nice vehicle with lots of room for it's size. I have been a passenger in my brothers Escape and have no complaints but I'm a chevy girl!
1819,a year ago,5,I love my car its perfect for me because I'm small but its getting to small for my family:( it's so good on gass to
1820, a year ago,5,I have a 2010 Ford Focus. It was my first car which I purchased in 2015. I’ve enjoyed it; it does what I new it to do and has been extremely reliable. I’ve had regular wear and tear issues and that’s about it. Definitely a car I recommend if you want something simple and reliable.
1821, a year ago,5,Perfect size vehicle for a small family or teen.  Safe and dependable and smooth driving.
1822, a year ago,5,I couldn't actually find my vehicle but it is very similar to this it fits all my kids plus more has video player and heated seats amazing vehicle for family
1823, a year ago,5,It has everything needed for a short or long drive. Lots of room for the kids or anyone riding with me. It is a smooth ride.
1824, a year ago,5,Easy to drive and see over the dashboard for a short person. Good cargo space as well.
1825, a year ago,5,Best vacation car ride ever. Rented for a few days and really enjoyed the whole car experience. I even wanted to purchase one after driving.
1826, a year ago,4,"Love my 2017 Ford Escape Titanium. Love the power seats the most. As a short woman (standing at a whopping 5'1) I love having the adjustments easy as possible and as customizable as possible. The sound system is fantastic, although I wish the Ford Sync wasn't outdated so quickly for a model only 3 years old. We cannot get the new software in our truck already, only bug updates for our current software. Love the double sun roof, but wish the window went back even further. After three years there is a little rust in spots - so be careful when buying and purchasing warranty - our dealership, Ford or that silly Final Coat rust protection the dealership scammed us into buying DOES NOT COVER rust. Love the truck, would probably buy again - but get a lawyer to read your contract/warranty and don't buy any extras they try to convince you will be worth it - a mistake I made as a first time buyer.    Ford Motor Company Ford Escape "
1827, a year ago,4,"Recently we've had issues with some of the motors, but overall, the Escape is a great vehicle. Great gas mileage. They go nicely in inclement weather. Fits 4 people comfortably but can seat 5 with ease. Especially children. plenty of cargo space as well. The new models give an option to move the second row seats forward to provide more cargo space if needed. "
1828, a year ago,2,"Great on gas and for a nice little work car, but the transmissions have had numerous problems and they don't hold their value. I'm a Sales Associate at a Ford Dealership. "
1829, a year ago,5,Love this model. Plenty of room (and I'm not a small person). They ride great. Good gas mileage at 24mpg average. Plenty of trunk space and leg/head room. 
1830, a year ago,5,this car is beautiful. it’s big on the inside and super fast!!! it’s comfortable and easy to drive
1831, a year ago,4,"Love my little car!! She is older now but still going strong.  The only issue I have is there is something wrong with my  conditioner,and no one can seem to find the problem. But she is great on gas. She's been with me through all kinds of wear and year lol"
1832, a year ago,5,Very nice car great features I just think these cars are to small on the inside not very roomy
1833, a year ago,5,"I drive my car everyday for work, perfect first car! Drives great and is super fast. Wish it had cruise control!"
1834,a year ago,5,I love my Ford. It’s really easy to drive and I like the leather seats. It’s super cute and it has all I need. I have no complaints and love my car.
1835, a year ago,5,"Me encanta está increíble, puedes ver los diseños antes de comprarla, pero yo la recomiendo mucho, y que lo es tan espesa para tenerla en un garash, está muy bien para las personas que tienen una familia grande, la recomiendo muchísimo ya que está increíble"
1836, a year ago,5,Awww encantada lindisima capacidad máxima velocidad inigualable es perfecta pata mi familia y amigos estoy emocionada y muy satisfecha  el color no importa mucho pero para mi es especial por mi familia y la capacidad
1837, a year ago,4,This car is a great car if you want a bit bigger than there smaller car called the ford focus.This car drives smooth. One con is that it isn't the most fuel efficient car. This car is in the more expensive price range. I whould recommend  this car if your not looking for a fuel efficient or sporty car.
1838, a year ago,3,This car is a great starter car. Great price range for people looking nice looking affordable care. Cons are that it is a very simple car...
1839, a year ago,5,Great suv. More affordable price range. Sporty looking.  A con is that they are becoming more compact all the time!
1840, a year ago,5,"Let be my escape it’s compact, easy to maneuver and gets great gas miles. Glad I purchased it"
1841, a year ago,4,This is a comfortable and reliable automobile. It fits a small family very well with great features and comfortable seats. It drives smoothly and gets incredible gas mileage. I would highly recommend.
1842, a year ago,5,I love this car it’s very good on my gas mileage. I had it for 4 years.  No con I would have to pay for it lol Is a con
1843, a year ago,5,This is my husbands car. He Absolutely loves it. He had the ST version. His little race car he zips to and from work.
1844, a year ago,5,It is an ok car. Gets me to point a and b. But has a class act lawsuit on the transmission. I have replaced my transmission 3 or 4 times since buying it in 2016.
1845, a year ago,5,I love the price that was listed on this car. The interior is beautiful in my opinion. The best part is how cheap it is on gas. Wish I would've chose another color besides white though .
1846,a year ago,5,My mom used to have a Ford Focus she love how it drove and the color and design in the vehicle. I would not improve anything on the car. The pros it gets you places.  It depends on the price. Yes I would recommend it. ￼
1847,a year ago,5,I like this product because of the styles. Pros of this product it gets you places.i would not improve this product because it looks nice they way it is. Yes some are affordable. Yes I would recommend this product. ￼
1848,a year ago,5,Such a pretty suv!!!! In the future I hope to upgrade! Such pretty colors and features and I would recommend to anyone
1849,a year ago,5,THE BEST. I love my car and the features that they offer. Different colors different unique insides. Mine is beautiful
1850, a year ago,5,"Es buen carro, pero no sale el modelo que uso en este momento, es muy económico. Hermosa camioneta. No le encuentro algún problema, hasta este momento todo esta muy bien."
1851, a year ago,5,Ford is the best model of car I’ve ever driven. It’s dependable. It’s honest. It’s real. My car gets me everywhere!
1852, a year ago,4,Not a huge fan of Ford in general but our Focus has done the job it needs to do! Gets us from point A to B safely! And the maintenance is easy and affordable so that’s a plus.
1853, a year ago,4,Good. Moro sucks. Lots of recalls. Perfect for a single person. Good gas mileage. I have the titanium so that’s a plus.
1854, a year ago,4,"My boyfriend has a focus. It drives smooth. I've noticed a lot of technical issues with his car. Like lights randomly going off, his blue tooth always has trouble syncing, and his dashboard just pulses light?!"
1855,a year ago,5,Drove as a rental. Nice car. Plenty of space. Gas mileage was nice. Loved the touch screen and the radio. Drive nice. Drive assist.
1856,a year ago,1,Nothing but problems. So many recalls I can’t keep up. Parts are hard to find and aren’t universal if before 2013. Wish I wouldn’t have bought.
1857, a year ago,1,"As soon as my brothers found out this was what I was driving they asked ""why?"" and it was because it was in my price range. I have a 2015 Escape SE....at 80k miles it has a rebuilt transmission and a new rack and pinion. I am not impressed. The backseat is roomy, if you don't have 3 car seats. Hatch space is okay though."
1858, a year ago,3,"I own a 2018 Ford Fusion. It’s okay, I do like it, however I’m just not a huge fan of it overall. I like the 3 screens in the interior and the seats are comfortable. Mine makes a weird knocking noise at the wheel area that gets annoying. It is pretty good on gas and is pretty quick. I have the eco boost version. Ford Fusion"
1859,a year ago,4,"For the price, it’s a good car. I’ve had a lot of recalls, but luckily they’ve all been fixed for free."
1860, a year ago,4,I don’t necessarily want to drive it every day but the newer ones are spacious and nice and it feels nicer than my BMW (2008) inside.
1861, a year ago,5,"Great car,has good leg room in ths front and back. Excellent on gas. There has been a few recalls, but Ford took care of things quickly."
1862, a year ago,3,It was a rental and worked very well. Too small for my opinion but it worked for the occasion.
1863, a year ago,4,"So nice. I want a new and bigger car like this one but it’s so expensive. One day, I’ll be able to afford it. But I have nothing else much to say except it’s nice ha"
1864, a year ago,4,My husband drives a Ford Fusion. It has been a great saver on gas. We also plug it in and recharge it it gives him a good amount of miles about 20. We would repurchase.
1865, a year ago,3,It looks nice and all but for me was not reliable as they are advertised. When it's working and maintained it drives smooth but they constantly have recalls and issues. For how expensive they can be too many big issues. I would not recommend this car if they are wanting something reliable or for a family.
1866, a year ago,5,I currently own a Ford Escape and I like it. It’s a great vehicle for year round driving and gets great gas mileage.
1867,a year ago,5,"I have a mid level Ford F150 4x4 v8  truck. It is a 2007. I bought it in 2008 with 3k miles. Its now 2020 and 200k miles and I have had very minimal issues thus far. Very pleased with my truck, except the mpg is roughly 10 mpg now and newer models get at least double this mpg. I do not drive to work daily. I work from home often so I so far have not thought about a more efficient car. I use the truck for camping and towing boat, other vehicles, and toy haulers. It has been a great truck. I have received the value of this truck happily. Before this, I had a tacoma and nothing but problems. Also a car and again...cheaper but in the end, I spent more on repairs. This F150 is durable and built well overall."
1868,a year ago,4,Pretty roomy and comfortable. Would recommend for smaller family. Large trunk space. Relatively affordable for the most part.
1869, a year ago,4,My last vehicle. I had the 2013 and I liked the body shape much better. I’m not a fan of the new crossover look. However it drives really smooth
1870, a year ago,5,"I get this car alot when I order through Uber. I find it to be a very practical vehicle, spacious and smooth riding. The seats are comfortable and it has great climate control in all areas of the vehicle. It has front and rear cameras and some models have a built in alert system that let's the driver know when danger is approaching."
1871, a year ago,3,"No comment, it wasn't a great ride and had trouble getting comfortable in it it even feeling safe it feels like a tin can car."
1872, a year ago,5,This is our secand car and we love it because its so simple and smooth for us my all family can fit perfectly qith alot of space i wish this car have automatic trunk option so it will be really help ful for us we love our ford and i really recommend  this to everyone who like great suv with great price ❤
1873, a year ago,5,"This is a very good family size car to travel longer distance, safe and still affordable in gas.They had different colors and very contrable to.drive."
1874, a year ago,4,my Ford fusion car has been a very reliable car over the past four years. It has all wheel drive and is very reliable in the winter’s. I would recommend this car for anyone.￼
1875, a year ago,4,"Owning a Ford Mustang years ago. I can say it was a good car especially if you keep upon maintenance. It was a 1992 basic model but we kept it going for over 10 years.  
I know my ex-husband bought it new but not sure how much he paid for it.  He gave it to me after I was in an accident and my Toyota pick up was totaled."
1876, a year ago,3,It’s an ok car. Pretty comfortable good amount of space. Don’t care for the way the transmission feels like it slips and I just prefer Chevy. Too expensive
1877, a year ago,4,"Small, very fuel efficient vehicle. Do not even attempt to fit an infant car seat in the back with passengers."
1878, a year ago,5,"I rented one my last holiday. 
Nice car, comfortable.
I used it only two weeks but it worked smoothly and I enjoyed driving it.
Not too big, I would recommend a bigger car if you have kids"
1879, a year ago,5,I love my suv it is very safe and I love driving it. It has enough seats and space for everything that I need to do. There is nothing to improve about this car. It is affordable.
1880, a year ago,5,These are great cars for new drivers as you can get them inexpensive just about anywhere and they are small but have enough room for people who are just learning how to drive and don’t want anything big plus they get great gas mileage and inexpensive to insure and fix.
1881, a year ago,5,Extremely reliable. We had little to no problems with our Fusion with all the driving we did. It’s a great family car that will last forever if you take care of it. My mom says that the only thing she can complain about was that the tires slipped on a rainy day.
1882, a year ago,5,Dz car is affordable and has comfortable space..speed is awesome.mileage is fab..it has sensors in it which warns about the pits on the roads.i love dz car.
1883, a year ago,4,"Nice car! Drive it since 2009, only “issue” the motor noise inside the car which was there since the beginning, Ford said that it’s normal and that we are overreacting ... anyway"
1884, a year ago,5,I learned to drive in this car. It’s prefect size for beginners and very controllable. I love this car.
1885, a year ago,4,Pretty good car. My Dad had this growing up and than gave it to my grandma which wasn’t hard for her to drive with her back problems.
1886, a year ago,5,I love Ford we have become a Ford family. My first purchase with Ford was a 2016 Ford Edge she was beautiful black with black interior and black tint. I have recently sized up after having a child to a 2019 Ford Edge. The size is perfect for traveling it doesn’t have all the features I had in my previous Ford but has a lot of other amazing features.
1887, a year ago,5,"Me encanta, cuando viajamos nos cabe todo es espacioso y muy cómodo. Perfecto para parejas o familias con uno o dos niños."
1888, a year ago,5,"An amazing family car! Loved everything it about it, from the interior to the smooth ride! This was my first car that I bought and I would recommend for all first time car buyers!! "
1889, a year ago,5,"Comfortable, spacious, good features, not issues that I could see. Liked the rims it came with. Spacious trunk also fits stroller"
1890, a year ago,4,"Me gustó mucho el diseño del vehículo, es cómodo y mucho más confortable que otros vehículos en los que he viajado"
1891, a year ago,5,"Un auto hermoso, seguro para personas importantes, un auto que solo visita el taller  para servis, nunca te deja en la calle! Gran elegancia y prestigioso! Vale la pena pagarlo!"
1892,a year ago,5,"Love my 2011 Ford Escape. Very reliable car and very spacious. Good for road trips or just general commute. My mpg is normally around 20 and it’s still chugging along smoothly at 150,000 miles"
1893, a year ago,3,"Have a few diesel F350's good work trucks. Very comfortable, very luxurious pricey trucks overall. The towing mirrors could be more relaible. Really enjoy how much they can haul, and I really enjoy how loud the turbo is. If you have the money for um, I wouldn't see why you wouldn't get one!"
1894, a year ago,5,"I have a 2012 Ford Focus that I love so much! I have the hatchback version and I love the trunk space and the overall look of the car. I’ve driven the car about 80k miles and it’s still going strong. I know there have been recalls on various parts and systems in the car, but I’ve never had an actual mechanical issue with the car. I plan on keeping her for the foreseeable future!"
1895, a year ago,5,"Amazing Car!  Very comfortable  and  trendy!  I  would  suggest everyone to buy It!  Also, the color  range is  very good! The usage of the fuel is  quite law and price is  affordable! So it definitely worth  to buy it!  I would recommend it of  course  to everyone! "
1896, a year ago,5,"Amazing Car!  Very comfortable  and  trendy!  I  would  suggest everyone to buy It!  Also, the color  range is  very good! The usage of the fuel is  quite law and price is  affordable! So it definitely worth  to buy it!  I would recommend it of  course  to everyone! "

1899,a year ago,2,"Don't recommend, vehicle needed lots of work, sold it. I kept up with scheduled maintenance and I still have problem a with the vehicle."
1900,a year ago,4,"I drove one of these as a rental in Arizona it handled the Middlemarch Canyon Rd with ease in the Cochise Stronghold. In fact it handled lots of terrain even in heavy rainfall and blistering heat. We got surprisingly good mileage out of this smaller suv as well so I was presently surprised as originally we were to rent a much larger vehicle. Easy to use cruise control when necessary but I prefer to do my own driving, nice dash layout."
1901,a year ago,5,It's an older Ford F-350.  It's got a lot of miles on it but has been a great vehicle.  It's pulled s camper to the mountains and a boat to the lake.  It is a crew cab and has a long bed which makes it a little difficult to park.
1902, a year ago,5,I got this as a rental when my car was in the shop recently and it’s a very nice car to drive. Very spacious and comfortable. When driving it’s quiet and smooth and overall drove very well. It’s a great family car if you don’t want that mini van life.
1903, a year ago,5,"My mom bought one in 2014 and just upgraded to a 2020. We love this car! It’s sleek, it’s stylish, an all around fantastic car. Smooth ride, easy to manage. The spin disk is the coolest thing ever."
1904, a year ago,5,Un auto muy cómodo al manejar con una dirección increíble que me permite manejar largas distancias y no sentirlas. Lo que me gustaría un poco es que no sea tan duro el embrague. Lo que y siempre lo voy a decir  Tener un ford en la casa es lomejor que te va a pasar! !!! 😁
1905,a year ago,3,its a decent little economy car. i personally like a bigger mid to fullsize vehicle and big trucks and suvs.. i have a large family and we could never fit in this car but its cool to run errands in. think tiny car when you go to look at this lol
1906, a year ago,1,I own this car and have had so so much trouble with it!!! Lots of recalls & after much research there’s a lawsuit on it cause ford sold with bad transmissions. I’ve had my clutch assembly rebuilt 3 times! and the car doesn’t even have 60000 miles.
1907, a year ago,5,Borrowed my sisters car while mine was down. Loved how this one drove. Although the sync system was a bit slow in it.
1908, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Escape! My last car was a Ford escape also! Its a really comfortable and dependable car! It does great on gas mileage and I trust the ford name! 
1909, a year ago,3,This would’ve been quite some time ago when I was getting my car repaired this was one that I was loaned and it served the purpose that I needed it for￼￼￼
1910, a year ago,5,Nice reliable car that gets from point a to point b. Pretty common car too so repairs and parts are easy to come by. The car looks good and comes in various colors. It seems like sometimes it has problems getting up to speed but I’ve never had any issues.
1911, a year ago,2,"I mean it was ok, not the best but as long as the car can bring you from point a to point b and back to a it will do."
1912, a year ago,5,"I love how it is such a reliable car and does not cost the earth to get things fixed when they need doing. The size is perfect for myself and my 3 children and is manageable costs to run.
It is a spacious car which is great on short and long distance journeys."
1913, a year ago,1,There is no power to this car. The manufacturer admitted to certain problems with this car but does not do anything about them. The price is extremly over what it should be for the issues with the car and the size. This car is very small and tight.
1914, a year ago,5,Love my Ford escape. Bought 2 in the last 6 years. Just the right size for me. Loads of storage space in the back. Many convenient features.
1915, a year ago,3,Good but not great. I’ve had a lot of recalls and service issues on this car. This car is basically made of plastic and everything breaks.
1916, a year ago,4,"I'm honestly in love with my fiesta! It's my first car, I bought it new in 2016 and it's still in perfect condition. It's the perfect size for me, 1l engine. Radio set up in it is great, can connect your phone via bluetooth. Feel like it's quite fuel efficient. Easy and smooth ride. My only apprehension with the car is the security system, as it's a keyless car, I know loads of fiestas that have been stolen and that stresses me out so I keep a steering wheel lock on mine"
1917,a year ago,3,Great little car. Modern and chic. Compact yet roomy. Great trunk space. Efficient on fuel esp long distance.
1918,a year ago,4,I love this car. My sister in law has one and it rides so smooth and has a good bit of space
1919, a year ago,5,I love my focus!! It’s so cute and I love the size and it’s just me! It drives really smooth too.
1920, a year ago,5,Such a great car! My mom had a newer version while I had an older version and that car never quit! If I could go back to this car I would for sure. Affordable price and super roomy. My friends and I used to cruise in this car all the time!
1921, a year ago,5,"Hola buenas noche 
Bueno la marca ford tiene año vendiendo son muy bueno esta linea ford fiesta fueron unos de los mejores, vale la pena tener esta marca de auto"
1922, a year ago,5,Had a 2010 ford fusion I loved it great family car fast and was great Dorr long trips easy  to work on  ran great
1923, a year ago,4,"I have a 2017 Ford Escape Se Eco. I feel like it drives well and is very roomy both in the front passenger area as well as the back passenger area. It includes 2 usb ports, 2 of those ""cigarette plug in"" ports and it actually has a 3 prong plug behind the arm rest in the back seat. My kids find that very handy because they can easily charge things like an ipad which would charge much slower using a usb ports. The back seats can lean back a few degrees making a long trip more comfortable. The lights are super bright and include a setting that projects lights to the side for night driving on roads where animals such as deer can be hiding in usual blind spots. The air-conditioning includes a vent in the rear located above the plug. It is very comfortable for me to drive and I'm a ""short"" driver at only 62ish inches. I can lay the seats down really quickly which is handy when I need to haul items. Also for this 2017 model there is a Ford app that lets me remote start, lock and unlock my doors. To have access to that for free from my phone is going to be very useful in the winter. 
The reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that although it is Eco my sister's Nissan rouge gets better mile per gallon when she uses her ""Eco boost"". This one does have a good mile per gallon. I mostly do highway driving but also some dirt roads which can include lots of bumps. The back hatch/door handle came loose when I only had it for a few months but I did buy it used."
1924, a year ago,4,Rides smooth and heavy duty! I love a ford made vehicle. I would recommend ford to anyone
1925, a year ago,4,Smaller SUV but overall a solid choice. I like the sporty look and the updated features and the car drives smoothly and maneuvers well. Ford is always a solid car brand and maintenance is reasonably priced so this car is a good option for most people with a variety of lifestyles
1926, a year ago,3,This is my first car so I definitely love it but there is just a few things that I am not a fan of. First of all there is a recall on the clutch in the ford focuses which makes my car jerk when I am trying to speed up at a light or something which makes it feel really scary and dangerous. Also the mit on the ford cars are terrible the way the pieces come together.
1927, a year ago,4,"I loved my 2013 Ford Escape. I purchased it in 2015 and drove it until 2020 when I traded it in for something bigger. It got great gas mileage but after having my daughter last year, I decided it was time for something bigger. The only reason for giving it 4/5 stars is because I hated the SYNC computer system in the car. I had issues with it a lot!"
1928,a year ago,4,Ill start off by saying it's fully loaded great gas mileage it's a perfect car to go traveling in or a simple daily drive I would recommend the car to everyone
1929,a year ago,4,"I have a 2015 Ford Fusion. I’ve always owned Chevrolet and was  nervous to own my first Ford. I have to say, I’ve honestly haven’t had any mechanical problems with my Ford. I had many mechanical issues with my Chevy. The only thing I would changer recommend is the Ford step up their technology and upgrades within the vehicle and screens. My 2014 Chevy prior to my Ford had better technology and a decent screen where is, my Ford now the technology isn’t there and screen is so tiny. If I could put the screen and technology into my Ford, I’d be hands down Ford all the way. I’m sure the newer the vehicle the better, but it’s a 2015,  so I definitely felt a little cheated on techno. Overall though, it’s a great car! ￼"
1930, a year ago,5,"Really safe, my sister got into an accident on the drive side and not a bone broken or hurt."
1931, a year ago,3,"Nulla di particolare da dire, sicuramente una buona vettura ma che non incontra il mio gusto . Mi riferisco ad una Fiesta del 2003"
1932, a year ago,3,For me it has been a very good option to have this car is very comfortable.it is spacious and very spacious but needs a lot of gas
1933, a year ago,5,"I love my fusion, not only is it super sporty but excellent on gas. In the 7 years I've owned it i haven't had any major mechanical issues."
1934, a year ago,5,good car and good gas mileage. seems to be reliable. smaller space on the inside but overall a good car
1935, a year ago,2,I own a 2008 and it’s so noisy and the car shakes and rattles I will never purchase this car again it’s way too small also
1936, a year ago,5,I love this car but please be careful to setting up the safety feature called my key because if you like to listen to loud music or drive fast don’t set it up
1937, a year ago,5,"My dad owns a ford escape with full options and it is absolutely luxurious! Has great options such as ambient lighting, massage seats in front, heated steering wheel and an interactive screen in front"
1938, a year ago,5,It was fine. Not my personal favorite but no terrible. Expensive in my opinion. There are so many different kinds.
1939, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Ford Fusion. I have a 2012 and I love the way that it runs. The only con that I have run into is that my car likes to run through batteries. I wish everyone could understand see how cool these cars are because they are truly perfect for a first car or just in general!
1940, a year ago,4,"Used to have an older escape and I was obsessed with that thing. It ran great, has enough room for what I needed at the time. Just sad I had to get rid of it."
1941,a year ago,5,"The best, so practical and perfectly sized. Looks dead sporty too! Super affordable."
1942, a year ago,4,"This was a friend’s vehicle, I did drive on a few occasions . It did handle well on the roads . It was very roomy. Enjoyed the drive"
1943, a year ago,5,"Great family vehicle! Fits a lot of gear for camping, big grocery shops, kids friends, and anything else you can think of! It was great on fuel for an SUV and an affordable purchase price too! I would recommend this to friends and family! It’s safe and reliable, the only thing that would make it better would be a 3rd row."
1944, a year ago,5,"I like how roomy it feels for a compact car! Great accessory options! Great gas mileage, and great fun to drive!"
1945, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my 2014 fusion! Never had a problem with it! Back up camera is amazing & it’s a safe car for my kids to be in
1946, a year ago,2,nice just do not do Fords they mean for me Fix Or Repaired Daily LOL. my granddad drained that in my head so it kinda stuck with me. specially since i had a focus and seen the money just going to my car even if I am a female I still have a father figure to help me understand the maintence on my car. 
1947, a year ago,4,This car is very sleek and looks nice. Good gas mileage but not super roomy. Good as a daily driver.
1948, a year ago,4,this is a good car! it’s nice on the inside and drives smoothly. i’m not sure how they are on gas or how easy it is to fix but i do know they are a little pricey but they are beautiful cars!! i would recommend!
1949, a year ago,4,"We got a Ford Escape after having our first child. A good size SUV for a smaller family. It can be difficult to do any repairs on yourself, due to the computerized nature of everything within the car, which is typical or newer cars now. Overall a good family vehicle."
1950, a year ago,5,I love this car. I only wish it was easier to service. I hear from mechanics that it’s hard to get to parts and even the dealership mechanic had problems getting to the battery. It rides smoothly and everyone is so impressed once they get inside the vehicle. I’ve traveled across the country with it and love it. It’s spacious and has plenty of space for all my cargo and pets.
1951, a year ago,4,Cute little car and good on gas. Usually comes standard with automatic locks and windows.  This little car seems to be reliable and decent in the snow and rain.
1952, a year ago,5,Ford does a great job at keeping the interiors of their cars up to date with the latest gadgets. They run smooth and have a lot of different options to choose from!
1953, a year ago,4,"Very sharp car, I feel safe and secure in this specific ford but it doesn’t do to well in wet weather conditions"
1954, a year ago,2,Literally everything on this car was starting to break down or literally fall off of it by the time I'd had it for a few years. It was a great car while it lasted... but very short lived. We sold it for $500 to a couple off the internet. The sound system I had in it was probably worth more than the car at the end lol
1955, a year ago,5,"I like this car, the truth is it is the only one I have, it is good for traveling is very nice"
1956, a year ago,5,"I like this car, the truth is it is the only one I have, it is good for traveling with my children"
1957, a year ago,5,"I like this car, the truth is it is the only one I have, it is good for traveling with my children"
1958, a year ago,3,"I liked the car for the most part. However, after this vehicle I don’t think I’ll get another Ford. I had lots of issues with it, but mostly due to repairs done outside of a Ford dealer. The gas mileage was not where I wanted it to be either. Advice, if you need repairs, always go to the dealer."
1959, a year ago,3,"Too small and not a highway car.  Great for young people but difficult for me, middle age, overweight, arthritis...to get in and out of."
1960, a year ago,4,The seats are comfortable and do not get dirty easily. More convenient and less fuel than other vehicles
1961, a year ago,4,"My Ford Escape lasted for several years. About 300,000 miles and it continued to work. Only when it reached 250,000 did things begin to breakdown due to extensive use. This was my first car and I liked it."
1962, a year ago,2,"Gas mileage--GREAT. Durability, depending on your environment, could be long lasting. Space inside car--don't plan on having more than 2 people in the back seat at one time. If it's a must, it's doable, but no one is comfortable being squeezed in a sardine can. Transmission problems!! Recall from FORD without being able to diagnose if my car had the issue, Ford wasn't helpful. "
1963, a year ago,3,Great modern interiors for ford but unfortunately don’t have great power or handling. Basic economy sesames with a plastic interior and cloth seats. Newer models have better accessories but like luxury feel.
1964,a year ago,3,"Lots of mechanical problems , constantly needed repairs , personally it a nice car especially if have big family but don’t skip any service as that’s when problems will start"
1965, a year ago,5,I had a ford fusion for 5 years and really liked it. Its a sharp car and had heated seats. A very nice add on. I never had any big problems with it.
1966, a year ago,5,I love my escape. I have not had it long but it is a comfortable ride and pretty good on gas. It is not 4 wheel drive but handles well in the snow.
1967, a year ago,3,"kinda fast, but it’s kinda tiny in the back seat, other than that it’s aMazing!!!!!!!!!"
1968, a year ago,5,"I love so much my car, It’s really economic. I drive everyday to go to work and come back home (30 min in the morning, 30 minutes in the afternoon) and i jus fill up the gas once a week, amazing."
1969,a year ago,5,"Grandioso totalmente cómoda, quisiera andar en una de esas sin duda alguna, es una que están en mi lista de favoritas sería feliz andando con una de esas"
1970, a year ago,4,Decent little car. Drives pretty good for the most part: could be a alittle more roomy but it’s not bad
1971, a year ago,1,"Don’t even drive this. Wouldn’t let me pick another option. Looks cool though. Nice color, overall nice car from picture"
1972, a year ago,5,If I ever saved up the money to buy a new car it would possibly be a ford focus. Drives nicely and is well made from what I have heard and seen
1973, a year ago,5,I love my ford fusion.  Have had no problems with it. Has been an all around great car. Bought it brand new and it was a great experience
1974, a year ago,5,We rented this car on our vacation. I loved this vehicle and all the features. It was a quick car and I loved how you can roll down all four windows before you get in the car by the remote so it cools off faster . I highly recommend this car
1975, a year ago,5,I have used my sisters Ford Escape a few times and loved this car. The only downside is the cargo area is smaller than I would like. The vehicle is a relatively inexpensive vehicle. I would recommend this car.
1976, a year ago,4,I had a 2000 used focus until 2016. She was a great car and I miss her but eventually the throttle body and engine mounts had to be replaced which cost more than the car.
1977, a year ago,4,"I love Ford Fiestas. As a young early teen, we rented a car from Enterprise and they gave us a like green Ford Fiesta and the gas mileage was incredible, the ride was super smooth and I think all around it's a sweet little car. I love them, even if they aren't practical for my life now."
1978, a year ago,3,I do like this car because it is really good on gas because it is really hard to work on if you have the hybrid
1979, a year ago,5,"very comfortable ride and had a lot of room as well! a lot of trunk space, def a plus!!"
1980, a year ago,5,"very smooth ride & roomy for the family. Good for family trips, we use my moms Ford Escape every time we travel, definitely reliable"
1981, a year ago,5,The 2020 model is so sleek and drives like a dream. It truly looks like a luxury suv. The touch screen entertainment center is a great touch! This is a great model and Ford really outdid themselves with the upgrade.
1982, a year ago,5,I love the Ford Focus it has hands free smart technology you feel like you are in a airplane. Smooth driving and vey eye pleasing.
1983, a year ago,5,"I really liked the new design. Very easy to drive, however I personally missed a bit more power. But it's a fantastic car for women, great to use in the busy city."
1984, a year ago,5,"Es muy bueno, no gastará tanta gasolina. En viajes es muy bueno y te trae y lleva sin problema alguno, es de los mejores que ha sacado la empresa y no está tan Caro el precio. Lo recomiendo"
1985, a year ago,4,"Very roomie car, the air conditioning and heating are insane- I don’t think I’ve ever been in a vehicle that heats up so fast!"
1986, a year ago,5,"Love my Ford Escape in the process of saving money to buy a newer one. It can go anywhere, I have had no issues in the snow."
1987, a year ago,4,"This was the first car I have purchased used. I received a good deal on it and although it has had a few issues over the years, it has been a reliable car!"
1988, a year ago,5,"I owned a Ford Focus titanium for a few years and loved its get up. I was able to navigate city traffic in this compact car. The seat warmers were perfect for cold days. The sunroof was perfect for riding on the highway at night, feeling the cool winds. This was my college car and served me well."
1989, a year ago,2,My parents got this as their family car a few years back and i am not the biggest fan. The car sits super low which is weird to me. Sitting in the back is a nightmare if you get claustrophobic or car sick. Definitely would not recommend if there are more than 2 people.
1990, a year ago,4,love this car. does eat up gas but it’s a smooth drive. my car is older than the one shown so the newer ones might be better
1991, a year ago,5,Drives very smoothly and fast. Would definitely recommend it for a first time driver. Its very safe and easy to drive!
1992, a year ago,5,"Ford 2019 fusion is sporty and such a great car. Drives perfect, has great amenities and huge trunk space. Back up cam is a huge help, love lane assist, alerts when people are in your blind spot, collusion alerts & more. Will definitely be driving this as long as I can!"
1993, a year ago,5,Love the trunk space and hybrid version. Has great fuel efficiency and love the sustainability aspect
1994, a year ago,4,Good sedan but I prefer more trunk space.  Have only driven the hybrid which has had a few issues but love the sustainability of it
1995, a year ago,5,I got my Ford Escape 2 years ago and it was the best decision I ever made! I needed a car that would be able to weather the storms of the winters in New Jersey. My previous car was a little 4 door sedan and I had one too many close calls during snow storms with it when I realized it was time to move on to something more like an SUV. I love my Ford Escape! It is easy to drive and the amount of room is fantastic.
1996, a year ago,5,"I love my Escape! It’s a great small SUV suitable for a single person or small family.  I personally have had a couple challenges with my battery and the electronics, but thankfully the service tech at the dealership was able to resolve them!"
1997, a year ago,5,I love my car I have not had any issues what so ever. The controls are easy to access and understand. It rides smoothly and is pretty good on gas. It’s an affordable car and is very nice for a small family. Also it’s good in the winter I really love the way it looks inside and out.
1998, a year ago,2,I have had my Focus for 8 years.  While it has been a great car for me there have been many cons! It has had many times I have had to take it to the shop! Will never buy another one!
1999, a year ago,3,"Very similar to the toyota rav4 but less trunk room space for groceries... great on gas, comfort is great"
2000, a year ago,5,"A lot of room for a car! Also, seats were comfy and I loved the size of the trunk! 1/10 would recommend this car!"
2001,a year ago,3,"On the whole, a great, affordable car but unfortunately we have had some problems. Needed a new engine, sensors before 45000 miles. All done under warranty. Ford has been great. Fuel efficient and family friendly."
2002, a year ago,4,Great bargain for what is it. Newer ones are so nice in the inside. Great for a first car as well
2003, a year ago,4,The newer models have a lot more functions! Definitely love the car play in the new ones. Overall great quality for the price
2004, a year ago,5,My husband drove one of these for years. It was a cute little car. We even drove it to Florida once. It did well on gas mileage. It is a very affordable car. Our family of three rode in comfort. It’s a reliable car.
2005, a year ago,5,"This is a car I would like to own. I’ve test drove them several times. I love how roomy they are. If I were to improve anything about vehicles, I would bring their costs down because they shouldn’t be as much as a small house."
2006, a year ago,5,I loved this car when I was driving it. So much space in the outside I loved the looks of the car and all the perks in the inside. Super fun and smooth to drive. Perfect to run errands and grocery shopping.
2007, a year ago,5,I would love one of these cars. The room in them are amazing. Good on gas and its a ford lol im a mom and this would be my go to car
2008, a year ago,5,So comfortable. Easy to drive & just all round feel safe in this car. I would definitely consider purchasing one
2009, a year ago,5,i’ve never owned this car but grandmother has one. she absolutely loves it and so do i. it’s probably the safest car i’ve ever rode in/drove
2010,a year ago,5,Cute car. Enjoy smooth ride . Nice interior.  Pretty spacious.  Absolutely no complaints about this car. They have even update it a few times and given it all the bells and whistles.  Its extremely affordable. I would purchase this for myself or my kids.
2011, a year ago,5,"It is a wonderful and comfortable car. It has a very good speed, i, adjustable and is a car that I can use for anything and with my whole family.  100% Recomended. "
2012, a year ago,4,"My wife and I took a long time before deciding to buy the Escape. We looked at everything from Honda CRV, Nissan Rogue, Mazda, Chevy Equinox and the Escape Titanium was what she liked. Easy for her to get in and out of the vehicle, very important! Can see all around through the windows even though it has the backup camera, and the style and looks of it just were better in our judgement than the others. the four cylinder with the twin turbos it will move, which where we live traffic wise was important to her to have great acceleration to merge with moving traffic. And mileage is right where the sticker and all the reading I read is where we are. No long trips yet! It has all the safety features she wanted, she is very happy with the vehicle. March 5, 2019 Update review on 2018 Ford Escape Titanium. Vehicle has 7700 miles on it since purchased in July of last year. Still very pleased with the vehicle, performs like we thought it would. gas mileage city driving has actually been better than quoted on the window sticker. A few longer highway trips with it. Handles and rides very well. Again the 2.0 lt four cylinder with the twin turbos, very peppy and smooth. I am an old school car guy and driven V-8’s mostly all my life but this engine in this vehicle performs very well. recommend for people to look at when looking for a new SUV of this size. Update, 3-5-2020, vehicle is still performing as expected, continues to take care of what my wife and I decided when we bought this vehicle. September 5, 2020 have had the Escape for a little over two years now, has 25,000 miles on it, with the Covid mileage driven dropped for several months, working from home. My wife still loves the vehicle she enjoys driving it, mileage is still good, and when I get my chance to drive it , still performs well!"
2013, a year ago,5,"It's very outstanding!!!!!! Amazing and affordable rateeeee and so comfortable!!!!!!!!    

Just love it!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
2014, a year ago,5,Tengo un Ford Fiesta 2006 y no he tenido ni un solo problema con el. Definitivamente me quedo con la marca y apenas tenga la oportunidad pienso cambiarlo por uno más actual. Las piezas son muy económicas.  Si recomiendo la marca ampliamente.. Ford Fiesta 
2015, a year ago,5,This is a nice car as well I’ve only drive in it a few times. But I thought that it was a good product and a very reliable car. Seems like a good car to get as you’re first starting out. Seems very safe and secure.
2016, a year ago,5,I love my car it makes me feel safe and secure. I’ve never had any problems with it. There is nothing that I would do to improve my car. This car is affordable I would say and yes I would recommend this car!
2017, a year ago,5,I have to say I was nervous about owning a ford but I haven’t had any problems with this one at all! Love it!
2018, a year ago,4,"Mi tía tiene este coche, a pesar de lo grande que es es muy bonito sus asientos súper cómodos."
2019, a year ago,4,"Great basic car, not any different than any other small sedan. Great reliable car for a first time driver"
2020, a year ago,3,"It’s just like any other basic sedan. You can get the upgrades and make it more exciting, but doesn’t do well if you need more than one car seat or if you have. Family of 5 or more."
2021, a year ago,4,Great mid sized suv. Great fuel economy. Even better if you have a small family. Stylish and sporty but also practical and pretty roomy.
2022,a year ago,5,I love my car. Has lots of room in it. I hate being in small places. Cons is there isn’t enough drink hold’s or enough plugins. It depends on price. Got mine on a good price. Would recommend the car though
2023, a year ago,3,"I liked my Ford Focus, it was a good car for a little while. Very zippy and a great car starting out however they always have transmission issues when the mileage gets over 100k"
2024, a year ago,5,I’ve had 2 escapes. They ran well and got me from point a to point b. My 2014 had a couple issues but overall was a reliable car and was the one I owned the longest. I only just recently traded it in.
2025, a year ago,2,I had an older model and as it got older it began to stall in the middle of driving and no dealership could ever determine the problem. I took very food care of this car and got it serviced often
2026, a year ago,5,"Model 2011, been a great car for me! A couple small issues, but still runs great!! It’s spacious, comfy, sunroof options."
2027, a year ago,5,I drive a Ford Explorer. It’s a cop car. It’s says so on the back. It’s white and it’s fast. I love my Ford!
2028,a year ago,3,"Mid to lower end of pricing products are overall ok. But keep in mind the productions and product quality of the fords arent the same as they use to they will have at some point some break down as they always do weather window issues, key entry issues the list continues."
2029, a year ago,1,The focus has awful review on the acceleration. It pulls as you are pushing the gas. Ford has done recalls to “fix” it. I wouldn’t recommend.
2030, a year ago,4,I had one of the older ones. It was a good little car but too small for me. It did serve its purpose for what we used it for.
2031, a year ago,5,"Loved the Escape. Lots of room and lots of nice new features that I enjoyed. I appreciate that the car essentially turns off when you're at a red light (saves fuel, better for the environment). Pricey, but worth the price for all the features that come with it. "
2032,a year ago,4,Loved mine when I had it. I bought another car recently and I like it also but at times I wish I never got rid of my escape
2033,a year ago,3,I have not owned one myself but my friends and a family member has one and love theirs!
2034, a year ago,4,The Ford Fusion is a very fuel efficient car.  It is stylish and roomy for the size class that it is in.  It rides smoothly.  The trunk size is very decent and can hold quite a bit.  The vehicle is mechanically sound.  I would recommend this sedan to others.
2035, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Escape to get me around locally. It’s perfect for my little family and the baby!
2036, a year ago,5,I used to own a focus and it was probably my favorite car. It drove beautifully and had all the features I needed.
2037, a year ago,5,"My sister owns one and loved it. She constantly got recall notices in the mail about faulty parts, so that stunk (sometimes minor other times major)."
2038, a year ago,5,A cute little car. It drives well. Personally I just like a vehicle that’s higher off the ground.
2039, a year ago,5,"Este es mi tercer ford fusion, jamás he tenido problemas, el primero lo compre de segunda y me fue tan bien que me decidí a comprar el mismo modelo pero del año."
2040, a year ago,5,"My very first car purchase! Lots of features, well built. She has not given me any issues thus far besides my back up camera failing. Other wise best decision yet!"
2041, a year ago,5,It’s the best car I have owned! Ford backs theirs products and I love that about them!
2042, a year ago,5,Great little car for beginner drivers. I loved learning how to drive in a focus because it was small but still had enough space inside that I was comfortable. Awesome on gas as well
2043, a year ago,4,"That car is good, but their spare parts are expensive! Another brand cars are very thrifty, that car isn't. But the velocity, stability bis good. The car or good, for my it's 3.5 Star 🤗 I like the interior and exterior, is nice and comfortable"
2044, a year ago,3,"I, personally, love this car. However, the Ford Focus models from 2013-now are not the best. My 2016 had severe issues with the clutch that had to be replaced 3 times in the 2 years I had it. The Focus prior to that, though, was amazing! It was the perfect size for me and did fantastically. It saved my life after I hydroplaned. Its a very sturdy little car, if you can find the right year. "
2045, a year ago,5,"It's a pretty great car! Lots of space, great speed, and a wide variety of colors. I have not experienced any issues with mine thus far and would highly recommend it!"
2046,a year ago,5,Great car! Love that it has car play. Super sleek and loves of great color options as well
2047, a year ago,5,I use to own an escape and I loved it. Until it crapped out and was too expensive to fix. I would buy another one
2048, a year ago,3,"My husband and I bought a 2016 Ford Focus SE, as a reasonable yet semi fun commuter car. We have already had 2-3 major issues with the car that luckily the warranty covered, but it’s a little ridiculous when the dealership has to replace your engine on a car that has less than 30,000 miles on it. However, I love the seats as a passenger and as the driver. They are plenty spacious! Also, gas is great, the acceleration is good, and the style is nice and sleek."
2049,a year ago,5,Where I live ford rangers are really strong vehicles. Where I live there are bad roads so it works quite good on the roads. It is affordable .
2050, a year ago,3,"Ford Focus is a great choice for those who want a sporty compact car. If you're looking for utility, however, it may not be the best option. The 2018 Focus has many strengths: Above-average predicted reliability rating..."
2051, a year ago,5,Very stylist car and very fast . Update . The cons are it tells you every place you been and pros
2052, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Focus hatch back. It’s extremely versatile and can fit my business and lifestyle.
2053, a year ago,4,"Well this car haves with me around two years, actually Is my first car I learnt to drive on this and Is especial for me."
2054, a year ago,1,Worst car I’ve ever owned. Had 4 recalls in 5 months and took over three years for them to actually replace the pieces. Customer service is HORRENDOUS. Never again so glad I got rid of it
2055, a year ago,4,My boyfriend owns a 2015 ford escape and she's a great ride. This is vehicle I finally passed my drivers test with. I personally enjoyed sitting up a bit hugher which allowed me to get a better view of the upcoming traffic. The only downside is she has bit of a wide turning radius.
2056, a year ago,5,My second car!!! I had a 2010 and the car drove like a dream. It was plenty of space.
2057, a year ago,5,"AMAZING for trips and big hauls! Perfect size family car, especially for young couples that are just starting families! Best purchase I’ve ever made!!!!"
2058, a year ago,5,"I average about 40 mpg with my hybrid Fusion. My car drives nicely, and because it's the Platinum version, has all the bells and whistles like self-parking, lane assist, etc if you choose to use them."
2059,a year ago,5,great car using for last 8 years love this old fiest model. Decent looking specially ivory color.Now want o switch over to next company - Honda
2060, a year ago,5,My parent own a Ford Escape and I love it. It is a perfect little SUV. Perfect size. Not too big and not too small. Seats 5 and tons of back room. 
2061, a year ago,4,I drove a Ford F250 superduty longbed for work for about 6 weeks. I thought it drove well and comfortably.  I enjoyed my time with it.
2062, a year ago,4,"I like it, good family car. I prefer my cars have more seats and more room for storage, but as an everyday just on the go car it’s nice."
2063, a year ago,3,"The Ford Focus is a nice car although it’s seats are quite low so if you’re not very tall, you might find yourself adjusting your seat."
2064, a year ago,4,The style is pretty basic. Compact little suv. Sitting in the seats aren't so comfortable where you could fall right asleep. I'd be okay renting this for a  weekend but not a forever vehicle.
2065, a year ago,5,"That is a good car, they are big, my friend has one and she said she likes, normally she drives this car for road trips"
2066, a year ago,5,my dad drives this car and he really loves it. i love how comfortable the seats are. plus the interior looks really expensive! it’s quite a step up from the old ford escapes. he uses it for work which is about 30 mins away
2067,a year ago,5,A very spacious and comfortable car very nice aesthetics and good color is very nice I think it is suitable for anyone who likes comfort
2068, a year ago,5,This ride is as amazing!  I didn’t like the white color by I don’t like any cars in white.
2069, a year ago,2,I have had this car for about 5 years now and it is the first Ford we have ever purchased. Compared to the Chevrolet I would have to say we will probably never buy a Ford again. We have had a lot that needed to be fixed throughout the time we have had it.
2070, a year ago,5,"We drove a 2019 Fusion on vacation and it was amazing! There was not as much room as I would like to have for a personal vehicle, but it was perfect for just a few days away from home."
2071, a year ago,5,"I love my car. I was in the market for a vehicle that I can have my kids, my fiance, and myself in. As well as be able to have some storage for traveling. There is the perfect amount of room and I could not be any happier. "
2072, a year ago,5,"They hace some problems with the shifting thing but they’re comfortable, the problems are because of an issue that comes with fabric defects"
2073, a year ago,5,"I love the for escape, its very comfortable and you can feel like you are driving and at the same time resting because of the seats"
2074,a year ago,4,Sometimes they have shifting problems because it is something that comes with the fabric defects
2075, a year ago,3,"The Escape in my opinion is too cramped inside, especially in the front of the cabin. They also typically seem to bounce a lot on the road. The price is great though."
2076, a year ago,4,My focus was a trusty car with great gas mileage. It was small and perfect for me prior to having children.
2077, a year ago,5,I love my 2014 Fusion Energi SE. Got a great deal on it as a CPO. Great gas mileage and features that some of the newer cars don’t have. Got thru transporting clients this past summer and not having to spend a lot on gas! Would highly recommend compared to a Prius or other hybrid sedan.
2078, a year ago,4,"We drive a 2009 Fusion. We bought it in 2012 fir $17,000 and we paid it off 5 years later. We bought it with 30,000 miles and it now has 100,000 miles. It’s been a great car. We have had 2 recalls since we’ve owned it, one of which parts are still not available to fix it. We have had a couple issues in the past couple years."
2079, a year ago,5,It’s such a comfortable and easy car to drive ! It’s great on gas. Amazing first time car for teenagers and just a down right good car to own
2080, a year ago,4,I liked my Ford Fusion! Was reliable and lasted a while. I only upgraded because I wanted some more space for the kids
2081, a year ago,5,Love the new ride clean comfortable very easy to see over the wheel and even tho we bought it used the excellent care was worth spending less money for the economy of the value
2082,a year ago,4,"Buen auto, compacto , fácil de conducir , precio accesible , un auto recomendable para una gran ciudad"
2083, a year ago,4,"My first care ever when I was 16/17 in 2014 with a year 2008 focus and I loved it except for its ability in the snow, but I’ve heard good things about the newer models."
2084, a year ago,5,Have had my Fusion since 2007. Love it 😍 it’s been a good car.  No major problems. ♥️♥️
2085, a year ago,5,I have an older model of Ford Escape and it’s held up wonderfully through the years! Much more durable than other car brands.
2086, a year ago,3,The car is good and guves really good mileage and its looks really good too.its just a bit expensive but its a really good car. Its really worth to buy a car this this and i would like to recommend this care to other cause i think its a really good car
2087,a year ago,2,These cars seem like they always have motor problems in my experience with several of these cars although they are comfy  I wouldn’t buy for myself they are not for me and I wouldn’t recommend to anyone
2088, a year ago,5,"Love my car! I wanted a bigger one originally but honestly, I’m pretty happy with the car that I currently have. It makes me feel safe/ secure knowing that if something happened there’s a good chance I’d be okay"
2089, a year ago,5,The product is very good ... I fell in love hahahaha ..... Super good jenial I really liked it .. Thanks for inventing it hahahaha
2090, a year ago,5,"Do year that I drove was a 2017. It had fantastic features, and a very smooth driving experience. I have no suggestions on approving this product. Based on all the features I would say it was probably expensive."
2091, a year ago,5,"Overall I absolutely love my car. The different features that I have in this car better than I’ve had in other cars. Make sure to follow up with the different warranties or recalls they send out. I recently had an issue with the TCM that was thankfully under warranty. Overall though, it’s a fantastic car."
2092, a year ago,3,"It’s ok. A lot of recalls, luckily no major issues. Gets me to my destinations. Really can’t complain pretty reliable car. Affordable & not too expensive"
2093, a year ago,4,I have a 12 Ford Focus. I have had no major issues with it and I would purchase again
2094, a year ago,5,I love fords! Strong and reliable and long lasting. They also feel strong and sturdy
2095, a year ago,5,We own a ford fusion Hybrid. It is an amazing car. It gets great gas mileage and we are considering purchasing another hybrid vehicle in the future. This car was affordable for our family and comfortably fits our family of five. I would definitely recommend this car to others.
2096, a year ago,5,"Really nice vehicle, super dependable and the extra features are very nice. It's a comfortable ride and the seats have all sorts of options for customization. The features are nice as is the sun roof. This particular one has sustained a lot of damage but functionality isnt compromised."
2097, a year ago,3,Good gas mileage but very very tiny. Can't fit a family inside. Drives fairly well and costs nothing in gas. Just way too small
2098, a year ago,3,No es mi estilo de auto pero es cómodo... He estado pocas veces en uno de ellos pero me ha parecido un buen viaje... No lo compraria de tener oportunidad
2099, a year ago,5,I currently use my moms Ford Fusion for running errands. I LOVE the fact that you can connect your phone via Bluetooth and the seats have a nice leather finish that are also heated. Definitely recommend 🤍
2100, a year ago,2,"Cheap, decent car. Would opt for a Nissan or Honda over this. Con: tired brand pro: elec will prob get good mileage. To improve, change the name, update image to speak to needs of first time or economy buyers. I think of this as a rental car that I’d rather not get."
2101, a year ago,4,"Surprisingly good car. Pleasure to drive - have only driven rentals. Would love to see a wagon version. Very well conceived placement of controls, unfortunately I am not a sedan/coupe person"
2102, a year ago,3,"Still too unwieldy, hard to see over hood, dash when you’re on the short side. Nice that they seem to have tracked nicely to introducing / integrating newer tech before others."
2103, a year ago,2,I do not like this car. It is very small. It’s good on gas but makes weird sounds . I think if there was more space it would be better .
2104, a year ago,5,At my old job I would drive this car often. It is very comfortable and spacious . It is a good family car . I would definitely recommend
2105, a year ago,5,Amazing good product if you are looking for a truthful and trusted brand and product this a good quality product that will make you feel save and happy spending on every Time you need to buy something amazing and beautiful made it so beautiful and good for everyone
2106, a year ago,5,She was a lovely car. Had 80k miles and no issues until she was destroyed in a hail storm. I loved the features and it was a reliable car
2107, a year ago,4,"My Ford Explorer is a good vehicle. Very roomy. We've never had trouble going wherever we need to go. We do alot of camping and off roading, and always had plenty of space for the dog, kids, and everything we needed and it has never failed to get us where we're going and back. I would recommend Ford Explorers."
2108, a year ago,5,Love everything about this car it’s my dream car like I love the seats and everything I can’t imagine a better car then this car
2109, a year ago,3,Pretty good for driving but has computer issues. the stereo connection and the computer controlling the steering wheel seem to fail fail the most often and ford has no long term solution.
2110,a year ago,3,"La voiture est difficile à conduire, elle a quelques années et pas mal de kilomètres au compteur, mais elle cale alors que l’on conduit en 3e et devient « dangereuse »."
2111, a year ago,4,"This is an adorable, comfortable and gas-effective car. It’s visually appealing, and fun to drive. It could use a bit more head space for taller drivers and passengers.  However, I’d recommend this car."
2112, a year ago,3,"It’s a normal car. I don’t own one so I was just a passenger. It rides smooth, so I can’t really complain"
2113, a year ago,4,Comfy a lot of advanced property and interior. Less leg space for passengers in back seats.
2114, a year ago,5,"I currently drive a Ford Edge. Drives very well, especially on the interstate. I haven't had any issues with vehicle, and I would definitely purchase another Ford vehicle in the future."
2115, a year ago,4,I drove the explorer it was a massive car but drove nice. I’m very short and it was hard to get inside the car but was able to make the seat comfort to drive
2116, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Fusion. I got into a car accident on the interstate with a guard rail and she’s still alive today to tell the tale. It gets great gas mileage and is an over all great car.
2117, a year ago,5,"As big Ford fan I love how it drives. It is fantastic car, interior gives you luxury and confidence of using the programs. Everything is logical and it is easy to set program you wish to have. I have it in diesel and it didn't disappointed me once yet!"
2118, a year ago,5,"Went in to buy a truck and took one for a test drive on the advice from my salesman. Loved the way it handled on the highway and gravel! Also love how zippy it is, couldn’t imagine not having a fusion."
2119, a year ago,5,"I have this car for a year and it does not give me any problems, it saves a lot of gasoline and the interior is comfortable and the trunk is large. Tengo este auto desde hace un año y no me da ningún problema, ahorra mucha gasolina y el interior es cómodo y el maletero es grande"
2120,a year ago,3,It’s fine. Gets you from@point a to point b. I really like having a vehicle. It is fine.
2121, a year ago,3,"I drive a 2013 Ford Escape SEL. I’ve had it now for 4 years and I don’t really have any complains. No major issues. Door handles are a little cheap and have fallen off for no reason. But it’s got tons of room for 2 kids, a stroller and a child’s wheelchair."
2122, a year ago,5,"Got this as a graduation gift and she has been a good little car to me. Very minimal problems, great on gas, and good speed"

2124, a year ago,4,"It's a sleek car that looks so sharp.  It looks, feels and drives like a higher end vehicle.  Love ours!  It has amazing acceleration and plenty of room for my two kids and my husband and I.  It's very affordable for what you get!"
2125, a year ago,4,"I love my escape.  Never thought I would, but it has all of the features I want without needing to 'upgrade' which package I wanted.  Love FORD dealership as well!"
2126, a year ago,4,Again I enjoy ford vehicles. My parents own a 2011 and it still runs very well for being 9 years. I love that amount of room there is for storage and the gas mileage is decent. Drives smoothly making it nice to drive.
2127, a year ago,4,I have only owned 2 cars before and both where Ford Focus. I find that they are reliable and run well. Yes sometimes things need fixing but that is with any car. I personally love ford vehicles and would buy another one without hesitation.
2128,a year ago,5,It’s a really hood car especially the eco boost ones they are really good gas savers
2129, a year ago,4,First Ford product I have bought and drove is a edge. I love my little mom car. I can fit all of my stuff in the back and you have a ton of leg room in the back. I only wish the driver's seat went back a little further for the tall men in my life. And I had a luggage rack.
2130, a year ago,5,I love ford. not many people do but I do. I also love my car. Drives smoothly and its just a perfect size for someone to start out with. 
2131, a year ago,5,"All of our cars are always Ford. We love the brand and will not change. They have the best cars trucks and suvs around. With so many varieties there is a something for everyone’s needs. We have a pick up truck, suv and convertible all from Ford."
2132, a year ago,4,Pretty smooth truck to drive. I love how much space . I love how you have the foldable chairs that way you can use the truck to pack things. Truck is very affordable and definitely recommend it to people!

2134, a year ago,5,"When I saw the 2012 Ford Fusion, I had to have it.  This car is perfect. It has four doors with plenty of space in front and back, easy cruise control, an amazing stereo system and safety features.  This car now belongs to my son and he enjoys driving it too."
2135, a year ago,5,A Ford focus was my first car and I absolutely loved it! I think it's a great small compact car. I would definitely buy another one.
2136, a year ago,5,"Creo que es un auto espacioso,es cómodo tiene excelente tecnología un diseño hermoso,y un motor excelente considero que no le cambiaria nada por que creo que está muy bien equipado yo lo recomiendo no solo por que es marca reconocida si por que duran bastante creo que vale la pena el precio que tiene"
2137, a year ago,3,"Very comfortable car, never driven but been a passenger on a regular occurrence. Very reliable."
2138, a year ago,5,Well what can I say about this car. I love it. It’s my first car and I am in love with it. So comfortable and nice looking
2139, a year ago,4,The Ford Fiesta is an awesome car. It gets amazing gas mileage and i never have issues with it. It’s the 2016 model and i’ve never had to have any unusual maintenance done on it. Very affordable as well!
2140, a year ago,5,"I drove one of these for a while good on gas very nice on the inside good features, nice setup for listening to music"
2141, a year ago,5,"For some The seats The seats are extremely comfortable The seats are extremely comfortable, The seats are extremely comfortable, the pilot's has electric lumbar adjustment The seats are extremely comfortable, the pilot's has electric lumbar adjustment The seats are extremely comfortable, the pilot's has electric lumbar adjustment and 10-position recline, The seats are extremely comfortable, the pilot's seat has electric lumbar adjustment and 10-position recline, while the passenger seat has only 6 positions. The seats are extremely comfortable, the pilot's seat has electric lumbar adjustment and 10-position recline, while the passenger seat has only 6 positions, They also have heating, their cabin is only for 5, For some reason it has 6 cup holders. In addition to this there will no longer be a need to fight for the temperature of the air conditioning since it has a double zone with automatic temperature control, I definitely love it"
2142, a year ago,5,"I love this car, it’s really great on gas! I wish it was a little bit bigger like a standard car but I enjoy it. The Bluetooth is great too. The ford dealership really worked out a good deal as well."
2143, a year ago,5,My car is amazing! I have a Baja bay mint colored 2017 Ford Fiesta manual and it is very efficient. It’s gas mileage is decent and  is very safe to drive. It’s small and compact and I recommend this type of car!
2144, a year ago,5,I have a Ford Mustang. It is a 2006. I've had it 14 years. It still runs like new. And looks new. They are great cars.
2145, a year ago,5,"I have no more to say, my car is 2012 and it still works perfectly. Its interior is much more modern than some newer cars. In displacement it is incredible. It is a compact and comfortable car. I am in love with my Ford fiesta. I recommend this car to people who travel long distances. Ford Fiesta "
2146,a year ago,4,"Nice nippy little car, comfortable, stylish, boot was a bit small considering I have 2 young children so have to take a buggy everywhere not much else fitted in it but other than that was lovely car to drive!"
2147, a year ago,2,Bought this vehicle on a budget. I should have went with my gut and bought what I knew would be a more reliable vehicle because of past experience. I’m normally a Toyota fan but had to make a decision to go with the escape. It’s not a bad choice but I’ve had to repair and replace more things on this vehicle than I ever had to with all of my Toyota’s combined and over the years I’ve owned 5 or 6 different models of Toyota.
2148, a year ago,5,My first car and I love it. I had to do a lot of work on it because it’s a old car 2005 but it still runs good.
2149,a year ago,5,I have a 2015 Escape and I'm absolutely in love with it!! There's much more cargo space than you would think since it's a smaller SUV. This particular model has so much pep as well! I'd say it's a pretty affordable car and gasing up never breaks the bank. 10/10 recommend this car!!!
2150,a year ago,2,It's a decent car for the price. Good reliability but lacking in quality. It needs better sound proofing as you can hear the road vividly at any speed over 45mph. I'd recommend this car as a commuter car or a first car for your son or daughter.
2151, a year ago,4,It’s a good car but have had problems with the radio and transmission for years. The dealership is useless and will charge you for things that should have been recalled
2152, a year ago,5,I love my car. I have enough room for my kids and family inside. I have a backup camera that I love and I can connect my phone so I can talk hands free.
2153,a year ago,5,"J’adore ma Ford , étant ma première voiture je la conseille , elle est agréable à conduire , niveau prix rien à dire et jamais de problème moteur , j’ai  acheter la mienne avec 150 000 kilomètres et rien à dire elle marche vraiment bien."
2154, a year ago,2,"Wouldn’t recommend this car to anyone tbh, it’s small as hell and not very comfortable. I’m only 5’2 and it felt like I was trapped in a little box and there’s accelerating issues"
2155, a year ago,5,"My mom owned a yellow 2003 Ford Escape and I loved it! It was the car I learned to drive in. It handled well for a beginner (the steering wasn’t too tight or too loose). It had great gas mileage. It was on the expensive side so when my mom needed a new car in 2016, she switched over to a Kia Soul and absolutely loves it!"
2156, a year ago,4,Even though 2006 really wasn't a great year for Mustangs all in all this car is actually held up pretty darn well. Just needed regular maintenance from a car that was made in 2006. Such as shocks and under Carriage of the rear the engine itself is awesome
2157,a year ago,5,"Great fuel mileage, not so great for passenger room though. Overall appearance is okay, performance not so much. In the winter it had a hard time going through heavy snow, in Canadian winters you need something that can handle that. "
2158,a year ago,5,"Beautiful ride for a great price! I’ve owned a Ford Escape for 5 or 6 years now and still rides like new! The technology is easy to use, and there is lots of leg room in the back seat!"
2159, a year ago,5,An Escape was my first car I bought on my own. It was great for short and long distances. Was great with gas for a small SUV and was always a smooth ride whether in the driver or passenger seat

2162, a year ago,5,We have 2 fords one truck. A 2002 ford explorer sport trac 5 speed manual and that mini pick up truck has been EXTREMELY reliable. We also have an 05 convertible mustang which we have not finished fixing so I have not had much time to use it.
2163, a year ago,5,This is a really nice car. In the front seat you have lots of room. The trunk space can be a little small when traveling.
2164, a year ago,4,I love the shape of the 2009 (older) escapes. The newer ones have lost a lot of trunk room due to the rounder shape. It is a great sized suv that can carry a lot. Unfortunately there are a few known defects with some of the smallest most expensive parts like the windows falling in the door or the ignition.
2165, a year ago,4,Nice ride overall and very spacious. Definitely spacious for multiple passengers to ride in.
2166, a year ago,5,This is a smaller sized suv that is easy to drive.  It is comfortable with some road noise on the highway.  I would recommend this suv.
2167, a year ago,5,My granddaddy calls it a spaceship lol it’s nice and roomy and an incredible brake system. Goes when you you tell it to as my sister found it with her super speeder ticket lol but overall a nice car.
2168, a year ago,5,I rented a ford escape while in upstate new york. I was use to a Yukon. It was really spacious for my kids and I. Had tons of trunk room for our luggage. It drove smooth and I really liked it. Would totally rent one again when traveling to any state. 
2169, a year ago,4,"I've driven the Ford focus and the Ford focus hatchback. Both handle well in all road and weather conditions. However, I was in an accident in one and the car was completely crushed! It's such a thin frail material that it was too easy to fall apart."
2170, a year ago,4,"Good gas mileage, roomy, sexy car. My cons are only because I've had a few things go out on it, rather early that are electrical and extremely expensive. My radio (acm) went out at 70k and still hasn't been fixed due to its 800+ dollars. So I have to listen to Pandora on my phone 😆🤦 My moonroof switch went out, and has maybe only been used 100 times, which is nonsense. That's a 400+ fix. I also had my AC go out my 3rd summer in the car, luckily was still under warranty as well as my gas pedal, but that was also under warranty. This is my 2nd and last fusion. I did buy this brand new."
2171, a year ago,5,I like the styling on the inside. The seats were very comfortable. The engine seemed to have plenty of power even when riding in the passenger seat. The steering was tight and comfortable and the suspension made for a comfortable ride. I would recommend this vehicle.
2172, a year ago,5,"I really enjoy my 2017 Ford Focus. I felt really accomplished purchasing this car. It’s cute, red and can zoom when needed. I would definitely recommend this car to any first time buyers. ❤️❤️❤️"
2173, a year ago,5,Fl50s drive great and are comfortable. Plenty of room to out stuff in the bed along with lots of leg room in the back
2174,a year ago,5,Great dependable cars parts are affordable enough and easy to get your hands on the parts....any problem I have ever had is battery or alternator
2175, a year ago,4,These cars are similar to my sonata but it has more space inside. It is very comfortable and very smooth to drive. The features in the car were really nice.
2176,a year ago,4,Decent car but found there to be a lot of problems involving the air conditioning. I would definitely improve on the air conditioning and it was fairly expensive for what you get. It’s an average car.
2177, a year ago,5,I recently purchased the 2020 Foed Edge ST. I'm in love! Has all the bells and whistles but a very reasonable price! Thanks Ford!
2178,a year ago,5,Ma belle montagne de testostérone à l'état pur! J'adore ma ford fusion 2010! Toute noire avec siège en cuir. Tout équiper et éditions de série! Elle est magnifique! Très économique! Elle a une bonne portée sur la route. Je la recommande chaudement! Un bon entretiens du véhicule et il vous dureras pour le temps que vous la chérirai!
2179, a year ago,4,"Nice small car gets you from a to z. Small body makes parking easier as you can fit into small gaps.. living in an area with parking permits ppl love taking the piss and park with huge gaps so it’s an ideal size to squeeze into those gaps
Cost efficient fuel capacity"
2180, a year ago,4,My boyfriend is making payments on his 2015 Ford Fusion. It runs fantastic!!! Much better performance than my boyfriend or I expected. It's acceleration really surprised my boyfriend. Our only complaints are it's VERY low profile on the undercarriage and the front seats are not power operated while the ENTIRE REST of the car IS powered operated.
2181, a year ago,5,This is a great car that gets me where I need to go. It is a smooth ride. It gets pretty good gas mileage and I have not had any issues with this car.
2182, a year ago,5,"I find it an excelente car. I love the many things you can do in the panel like: having warm and cold air in your seat, seeing messages, music, waze, and many other things. Its ceiling opens which is also amazing. I definitely recomend it!"
2183, a year ago,4,"I know that not everyone likes fords but I like mine and I like the idea that it is an American made car so if anything was to go wrong with it, its cheaper and easier to get parts replaced (which have only been my breaks)"
2184, a year ago,4,"I love my focus. Its small and compact with a hatchback which makes life easier for me. Theb only downside is that it does not preform amazingly in the snow, even with good tires it gets stuck, slides, and can't make it up hills"
2185, a year ago,5,"Love my car.  It’s great on gas, lots of room and Drives really nice.
It comes in a beautiful blue color.
Was very affordable monthly.     
Would definitely recommend."
2186, a year ago,2,"I'm not a big fan of Ford in general, and a lesser fan of the Ford Focus. Everything just feels so cheaply made and there are so little upgrade options to make it feel less rental carish. For around the same price, you're better off looking at other car companies."
2187, a year ago,5,"I’ve had this car since 2015. I drive it much less than I used to, but it’s comfortable, spacious and easy to handle. I enjoy driving it and it gets really good gas mileage."
2188, a year ago,5,"I used to own a Ford Focus and it was a great car, I loved it! It’s affordable, safe, easy to drive and great on gas! I really love the newer models! I would definitely recommend this vehicle to others."
2189, a year ago,5,Perfection perfection I love this car but it’s not my car what is a good car or your car similar products
2190, a year ago,5,"I love love love LOVE this car. While I wish it had a few more features like the newer ones have, I’d still rage it 5. So safe and such a nice drive, very very comfortable. A perfect starter car for newbies!"
2191, a year ago,3,"The drive was overall pretty good and smooth, but the technology experience was subpar. The infotainment screen was very small so I couldn’t really see much, it also didn’t have some of the newest features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto."
2192,a year ago,3,My friend has the Ford Escape and she really enjoys it! She loves the features she has and recommends it to all parents. Also a good car to travel in. Pretty affordable as well for the value you receive. I would recommend it if you have to travel for work and drive long distances or have the travel bug driving state to state!
2193, a year ago,5,"I've had my car for almost nine years and 98,000 miles and she's still holding on like a trooper. The crash rating is incredible (I did wreck my previous ford focus and it held up to a bad accident). It is a bit strange because my front windows are automatic but the back windows are manual. There have been a few recalls but ford took care of them quickly and without issue. She handles well and has stood the test of time. "
2194, a year ago,5,"I loveeeeee my Ford Escape! It’s such a fun and spunky vehicle! It fits my lifestyle and personality perfectly. I’ve had such a great experience with it and have owned it for three years! No plans to get rid of it, it’s everything I need!"
2195, a year ago,3,"Es muy cómodo, el motor es magnifico es elegante  es muy ahorrador de combustible muy útil para trasportar caben muchas personas"
2196, a year ago,5,We considered purchasing a Fusion when we purchased our last vehicle (we ultimately decided an SUV was better for us).  We loved the sportiness and comfort of the Fusion.  The value was very good.  We would definitely consider a Fusion or another Ford vehicle in the future.
2197, a year ago,5,I love my car. It’s a 2006. I bought it 2007 and still running.   Great suv.  It’s great for little kids.  I do need more room for my son.  It was a great price and I would recommend it.
2198, a year ago,3,"I learned to drive in a ford Fiesta mark 1, and back then you had to pull the choke out to help start it up. Then I drove a mark 2 Fiesta which was much better, had more to it and ran well at such a good price. I have then driven the more recent Fiesta's which are totally a great little run around, and again, I'd consider buying one if my finances meant that we could be a 2 car family. They're great value for money and they run well!"
2199, a year ago,5,"I've driven a ford focus many a time and it's very comfortable to drive. It's quite a spacious car, easily handled and I have no complaints other than when the boot is open, water runs down the sides and into the boot itself. We have the Ford Mondeo as a family car, but I would definitely consider buying a Focus just for myself. Keep up with the servicing and it shouldn't give you any problems at all!"
2200, a year ago,3,"It’s a nice looking vehicle, but I have had several issues with this car. There have also been several recalls as well."
2201,a year ago,5,Este vehículo es muy bueno la verdad es un 10 de 10 tienen que comprar este vehículo les va a salvar la vida yo use este producto y de verdad es buenisimo
2202, a year ago,4,Love the suv- sometimes I think the dashboard is crowded and the arm@rest does not go up enough for my arm to rest on. But rides good-drives good- and my grandkids love riding in “ninny’s car”.
2203, a year ago,5,Literally the only thing I will drive. I have NEVER felt so safe driving. I was in two really bad car accidents and it was my escape that really kept me safe. One of them had my entire back end removed and the other my car flipped three times. I never had a scratch. Safety with ford.
2204, a year ago,5,"Comfy! I have always been a passenagr, but the car seems super safe and it’s roomy and a really nice interior and exterior"
2205, a year ago,5,"Well, we have been with him for more than 10 years and he is still with us in good condition. These last two years have been where we have had the most to invest in maintenance. It may no longer take a long road trip, but getting around town is fine."
2206, a year ago,5,It’s a good car for everyday use nothing special but not bad and gas seems to last good amount of time even with daily work trips and errand runs
2207, a year ago,5,"I upgraded from my Kia Forte Sedan and I do not regret it. I really needed the extra space as I have two kids and this car offers all of the accessories I love for an affordable price. Its not too big but roomy. I love my radio system, backup camera and my hands free services."
2208, a year ago,3,"Had a lot of issues so far with this car and it’s a 2016. I’ve had to have a lot of work done to it, I would love to have a new and improved focus or something at least that lasted a little longer"
2209, a year ago,4,I love my old escape! I own a 2007 and it is so sturdy and safe and easy to drive! lots of room and minimal blind spots! decent on gas considering its age and in my 3 years of owning it USED I have had to do very little upkeep other than my regular oil changes. I would honestly get a new escape as my second car once this one gives out!
2210, a year ago,5,I rode in a f150 economy. It was a nice ride and had some power behind it! Alot of room in it as well! Definitely a family truck
2211, a year ago,5,I have the hatch bad and it is great! Enough room for the kids and stuff in the back. Gets great gas mileage and awesome stereo.
2212, a year ago,4,I love it but ir could be better. For example i would like to have more lights or lamps
2213, a year ago,5,El auto de mis suelos me encanta es lo más lindo que tuve y me gustaría super tenerlo me encanta y me gustaría comprarme otro.
2214, a year ago,5,I liked this vehicle. Had plenty of room. It drove great and had heated seats I loved
2215, a year ago,4,My mom has this car. The seats are hard. I need a soft seat. I like that her car is spacious but I will always love my Honda
2216, a year ago,5,I have had two Ford focus is throughout my entire life. Both were absolutely great in the snow and great when it comes to gas. I would suggest a Ford focus to anyone who’s looking for a basic and practical car! I do wish they were a little bit more luxurious.
2217, a year ago,5,My boyfriend has an Escape and it is the perfect size of SUV. I enjoy that it has plenty of room but it isn’t huge.
2218, a year ago,3,"
The best thing about the Ford Focus is the gas mileage. It is a tiny car and with smaller gas tank but it likes to pick and go. I had a few recall issues like a shuddering acceleration but after new tires and brakes it seems to be a bit better. I would get something a littler bigger if you ever plan on having passengers. "
2219,a year ago,5,"I love my car, it has enough room for me and my two kids. Good trunk space. Smooth drive and good on gas."
2220,a year ago,5,"Drives great, comfortable and perfect for carting my son around to his sporting events! Plenty of trunk space for gear!"

2224, a year ago,5,Muy lindo y comodo!!! Bamos a todos lados con los niños !!! la verdad es que viajamos muy comodos todos juntos!!!
2225, a year ago,4,"We have a 2016. We love the card, the way it drives is very smooth. Only dislike is the digital console. The GPS/temp/radio in this model is very much not user friendly or intuitive. We got it at a great price and is very reliable though so we recommend it"
2226, a year ago,4,"This was a great car! I had a 2007 and got it used in 2009. It handled well, even in the winter. Had great sound and was spacious. I still miss this car."
2227, a year ago,5,"That’s a party in a car! My BFF had it, & we’ve had a blast in it!! It’s small, but you can be creative with it. Perfect for me and my BFF, RIP NICOLE RAMSEY. That car lasted awhile though, it got around lol!￼￼"

2230,a year ago,5,Very reliable car. I owned one for a couple years and put about 35k miles on it. I would recommend it if you are looking for a nice looking car and not expensive
2231, a year ago,5,"I love my focus its so reliable cheap to run and if anything does go wrong the parts are fairly priced.
Ford is one of the best car brands."
2232, a year ago,5,This car is super easy to drive I really like it it’s like the perfect size and it’s really good for beginners to￼
2233, a year ago,5,"Great vehicles.  They are so comfortable and good for long drives. Great for trips, these SUVs are expensive but are great vehicles that last! So versatile and useful!!! I would love to buy a new one but they are expensive, but so worth it!! Highly recommended!"
2234, a year ago,4,"Decent 150, kept on maintenance and hasn’t had any major issues. 2001 268k+ miles so I’m satisfied at this point "
2235, a year ago,5,"I love the space and the modern feel! We upgraded to a Ford Explorer for the third row, but I highly recommend the Escape as well. It’s a great family car. Luxury feel at a non-luxury price! Definitely worth a test drive."
2236, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Fusion. It drives and rides so smoothly. The extras of my package are a great bonus. It’s nice and spacious at all capacities. Affordable and great on gas mileage.
2237, a year ago,5,I have rented the Ford fusion many times on trips in love how the ride feels and handles. There’s ample room in the trunk for your luggage and multiple spots in the cabin for people. Don’t hesitate to rent that car.￼
2238, a year ago,5,"My partner owns a Ford Focus Titanium X which I have been passenger in and have also driven myself. It's a lovely car to drive, very comfortable on long journeys and quite spacious. I would recommend this as a decent day to day family car, very affordable also!"

2242, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my ford fiesta. I've had it for just over 2 years now. I'm a commuter and drive to and from work about 1.5 hours a day of driving. It's super good on gas. Not a very spacious car but as a single woman with no kids it does everything I need it to.
2243, a year ago,5,I bought a 2002 focus back in my college days and it has the base speaker and amp built into the car which was awesome. I loved that car super fun little stick shift that got me almost all the way through college while adding children to the equation.
2244,a year ago,3,It’s actually a my moms 2017 Ford fission that breaks down. So much we have to repair it at least every 3 months
2245, a year ago,4,"I have a Ford Focus Hatchback. It gets GREAT gas mileage and for the most part, runs pretty well, however there is an issue with it slipping gears between first and second, and Ford told me that it is safe and that there is nothing that can do about it. It very much is an annoyance, if anything. And I don’t like the hatchback design because I feel like I actually fit less into my car than in a normal car"
2246, a year ago,4,"I grew up on a farm, so we had a work truck, like many farms do. Ours was a Ford F350 Dually crew cab. I learned how to drive on a tractor, but the Dually was my first vehicle I drove. I loved that truck. It was massive, but in our small town, people knew who's it was and they were nice (or scared??) and always let us have the right of way! It was perfect for hauling trailers of any kind, and the bed was useful for carrying feed, lumber, etc."
2247,a year ago,2,"I have an older model, something always seems to be going wrong with it. The fule economy is competitive."
2248, a year ago,5,My family owns one and my siblings love it. Perfect size for all members. The car is perfect for urban areas and surroundings. The car has a beautiful form and size. A little bit expensive but worth of the technology it has and the security it brings.
2249, a year ago,5,It fits my family...  I love how its not to big...  its been my dream truck forever and I just love driving it around... i always want to travel in it... i recommend people who have kids this would be a good truck to get them when irs time to let drive
2250, a year ago,4,Comfortable and beautiful inside and outside. Love that red color. Engine works fast and safely
2251, a year ago,5,"woow el.diseño exterior es hermoso desde 2013 que lo vi me encantó, porque tiene aire de diseño deportivo y muy elegante y apesar de los años no se ve pasado de moda ni como un modelo antiguo, Felicidades al diseñador, es amplio con cajuela amplia, fácil de manejar, asientos ergonomicos."
2252, a year ago,5,I use to have this car and it’s a great reliable car for a first car that will last a long time
2253,a year ago,5,"The Ford Escape is a very comfortable SUV to sit in with a beautiful interior and if I was looking for an SUV right now, I would definitely consider this one. Ford offers dependable and reliable vehicles that perform extremely well. I am always happy when I see an Uber driver pull up in a Ford Escape and always enjoy the experience. "
2254, a year ago,4,Great fuel efficient car and fun to drive. It got great gas mileage and had a great sport feel although it was very specific.
2255, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Escape.  It is my first big girl mom car and I love it.  It is spacious and cute.  It’s great on gas and low the eco boost feature.  Best of all it is also comfortable.  Love this car for my family.
2256, a year ago,4,Compact car with an ok amount of leg room. This car is not made for people larger than six foot three. The fusion gets good gas mileage but can get up and go when you need it to. It as all around a nice car I would recommend.
2257, a year ago,2,Me encantaría tener este carro se mira muy lindo y muy cómodo y el color es muy lindo
2258,a year ago,5,These cars are very smooth and easy ride. Very comfortable good on gas and the price is right. ￼￼
2259, a year ago,4,"I bought my Escape new in 2018 and have had it through a few winters now.  It holds up well, but I still feel safer in my truck during inclement weather.  The price point was perfect and I didn't purchase it during any sales or promotional periods.  So far, I love it and the fuel mileage is amazing at 30 mpg.  I'm giving it a 4 star rating only because it doesn't have a locking 4WD option, rather the intelligent 4WD."
2260, a year ago,4,"I love my Ford Escape. I did have transmission issues with it when I first got it but thankfully I had a warranty that covered it, but other than that I love it"
2261, a year ago,5,Very good product. I would highly recommend this to friends or family. If you are thinking about trying it you won't be disappointed when you do
2262,a year ago,5,Smooth drive and nice looking car. I also heard the customer service is exquisite. I wouldn’t improve it it’s already perfect. I say it’s affordable. For any student who wants to start paying for a car.
2263, a year ago,5,It’s a good car. My first car and I love it. Not much to that. Yeah no cons on it. Works fine.
2264, a year ago,4,"Super comfortable, cute, pleasant and easy to park. it's roomy enough and great with any color. However, it can sometimes fail"
2265, a year ago,2,"I want to start by saying i had the ford fusion the first year it came out- around 2007. i unfortunately had transmission problems before 60,000km. I LOVED the handling and the way it drove, it had alot of power and was very spacious and luxurious. I believe the first year a car comes out, it is more likely to have problems. That being said, it was a great vehicle for Canadian winters with lots of control on snowy roads. I believe the later models after 2010 are known to have less problems but would advise doing some research before buying."
2266, a year ago,4,I love this car it's good and comfertabel.. Love thé design and the quality ...It's wasn't mine it belanged to my friend..
2267, a year ago,5,"Es el mejor carro del mundo. Es ágil, fácil de manejar, cómodo y hermoso.... es muy precioso"
2268, a year ago,3,"My daughter bought a 2016 Fiesta last year, as her first car purchase. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles, but it is a decent first car for a teenager paying their own way. It handles well, and is excellent on gas. It is easy to change the oil and she is able to do this herself now after her step father taught her how. I recommend this cat to anyone looking for a good solid small car on a low budget."
2269, a year ago,3,Ford Flex 2011...microsoft sync package is a nice addition. Sirius satellite radio also available. Like the dual drivers seat memory and the hands free media options. Also love the front sunroof. Wish the rear moon roofs opened. Quite a few electrical issues though. Paint is looking pretty bad with lots of sun damage and cracking.
2270, a year ago,5,"I love this car & it’s my first car, it’s good on gas & I love the sun roof cause I live in Miami & I just need a sun roof 😭"
2271, a year ago,5,"Adoro este carro, esta marca es una excelente opción, este carro prácticamente me enseño a manejar"
2272, a year ago,5,Great Car.  Dependable and great for everyday usage.  I like the heated seats and radio control in the steering wheel.  I wish it had bluetooth so my music could connect.  Its affordable and easy to drive 4 door sedan.  I would recommend this car for anybody.
2273, a year ago,5,"I love it's a cool car easy to use and very safe the color I love it other than that it's very comfortable, It's easy to clean plus it has multiple seats"
2274,a year ago,4,"Comfortable car to ride in. Pretty roomy. Good fuel economy. Ford tends to be a little more expensive than other companies, but I personally like them."
2275, a year ago,3,"Es un coche muy bonito y cómodo, se conduce bien (yo no conduzco). Me parece muy estético."

2280, a year ago,3,Thus is a great SUV depending on your family size! This was perfect for a couple and a carseat! A little to small for 2 carseats
2281, a year ago,5,Very realable and comfortable. Mine is a 4x4 and it does a really good job when its snowing. I love my car and how good job has done so far.
2282, a year ago,4,"We rented this car to drive from Vegas to Colorado  to pick up our rescue dog. Great ride, incredibly comfortable and spacious. It was a smooth ride and good on gas mileage also. We definitely considered leasing this car after we rented it."
2283, a year ago,5,i got the 2020 fusion as a loaner vehicle while mine was getting fixed. loved it! it was bigger than i’m used to (i drive a ford focus) but the features are amazing! and the gas mileage is great too.
2284, a year ago,3,"i have the 2015 ford focus se. i enjoy the size of the car, but the transmission is JUNK. my car only has 55,000 miles and i’ve had to replace the klutch twice. and it’s an automatic car .... they decided to do some weird style transmission for these models and it’s just complete junk. it gets me from point a to point b tho. the sync is also crappy as it doesn’t connect in the rain sometimes but the speakers are awesome."
2285, a year ago,5,"This car was a rental and I didn’t mind it, it wouldn’t be my choice but it isn’t a bad choice."
2286, a year ago,4,"This car with all the bells and whistles is actually quite nice, however, if you get the stock car, it isn’t very nice and was a very boring ride."
2287, a year ago,5,"This is a comfortable car and I feel very safe as a passenger. However, you sit very low to the ground"
2288,a year ago,5,Works great. Never had a problem with anything. Does go through break pads like crazy. Has a lot of room for all my fur babies.
2289, a year ago,5,"I love the Ford Fiesta! It is a smooth ride, good gas mileage, and very dependable car. The Bluetooth is very convenient and I love the size. I wish it was 4 wheel drive and had heated seats. It is comfortable to ride as both a passenger and driver."
2290, a year ago,4,"Este carro es especial es muy elegante pero lo mejor de todo es que es muy útil y su motor es bueno, no es necesario estar cambiando piezas tan rápido. Respecto al hacerle servicio es mi fácil y con eso funciona perfecto."
2291,a year ago,5,"It’s a very good car, the quality is very high for the price and the car it’s very good for new drivers!!!The motor is very fiable and isn’t expensive for normal people. I recommend so much!!!!! This model it’s beautiful 🥰"
2292, a year ago,5,I love ford styling and driving experienc. It's comfortable but again is quite expensive to get decent spec in the cars but so worth it
2293, a year ago,4,"I had a focus for about 6 years, it was a good car. I liked the features it had, the interior was comfortable, and the gas mileage was good. Unfortunately the 2013 model had a recurring issue with the transmission. So I would have to take it to the dealership at least once a year to have them ""fix it"""
2294, a year ago,5,I have had my escape for almost 5 years and it’s the best vehicle I’ve ever owned. It is great on gas and rides like a dream!!!
2295, a year ago,4,The Ford fusion is a good mid size car. It provides composed handling and a smooth ride and its cabin has plenty of space across two rows of comfortable seats. It has a large trunk and many of the infotainment features are easy to use.
2296, a year ago,5,"My mom drives a 2015 Ford Escape, and it is suuuper nice. It’s sort of a mash between a luxury SUV and a sedan. It’s got a really nice screen and Bluetooth pairing, as well as seat and back heaters. It is a lower ride than an SUV, but is still a larger car. The breaks and gas are super responsive, and the steering is smooth. It’s a good car! I’ll be intrigued to see how it ages."
2297, a year ago,2,I would personally never want this to be an everyday drive for me. The car can get shaky at times and the consol feels crammed. The look isn’t as high tech and modern a man other makes.
2298, a year ago,1,I owned a 2000 Ford Focus. It was a total piece of trash. It had more repairs than I can count on both hands in the four years I had it. We definitely put more money into it than we bought it for. My dad and mom also have had two different types of Fords that they’ve had a plethora of bizarre problems with. I would never buy a Ford again.
2299, a year ago,3,no soy muyfanatica de este tipo de carro pero el eqipo es bueno y si te gusta algo pequeno ese es el indicado
2300,a year ago,5,"excellent car without a doubt.

 Kt handles very well, it is comfortable to sit behind the wheel. 

(Comfortable for the whole family, children and seniors)."
2301, a year ago,5,"It is a quiet car that glides across the roads. You may find yourself going faster then you thought with how nice this car drives. It's comfortable seating hugs you nicely to keep you safe. The blue tooth system in the car is a dream, might take a moment for your phone to sync but once it does you are good to go. The backup camera located in the rear view mirror is honestly my favorite feature, keeps everyone safe!"
2302, a year ago,4,I really like riding in these cars because they are quite roomy. I like that some are hybrids. I just don’t really love the ford brand. I think they’re pretty mid range and don’t do anything special but not terrible
2303, a year ago,5,"Great dependable car. My husband has had his for several years, and we haven’t needed very much work. Pricing for parts is good. If you’re looking for a no-frills car, the Ford focus is a pretty good way to go."
2304, a year ago,5,I got this car for my fiance and he fell in love it gets good gas mileage and doesnt cost an arm and a leg to get something fixed
2305, a year ago,5,I love my car it gets great gas mileage and i have never had a problem with it definitely recommend as a first car because its super comfy
2306, a year ago,5,Love my vehicle! Is really good on fuel and gets me from point A to point B safely! Works great with a new baby.
2307,a year ago,5,Sin duda me encanta y siempre viviré enamorada del ford focus es un carro con mucho valor para mi porque siendo el primer carro que llega a mi familia es perfecto no hay mas que perfección
2308,a year ago,5,"Very comfortable vehicle with impressive comfort, apart from that a starting power and speed that impress any 4-cylinder vehicle when we talk about the v6 version"
2309, a year ago,5,"I love my escape. It gets 24.6 mpg. It’s a great sized vehicle and quite fun to zip around in. Drives well. I have almost 100,000 miles on it and it still runs as good as new"
2310, a year ago,4,I loved my 2005 Ford Focus. I called it a tank because it seemed to keep me really safe when the inevitable occurred. It held up well until I decided to upgrade in 2018. It was my first car and I took it on many road trip adventures from the Midwest to Florida all the way to California!
2311, a year ago,5,"I have the ecobost which saves me alot and helps towards the environment with the job I do. Perfect boot and passenger room easy to drive perfecf sound system sinks to my phone allowing me Bluetooth Syn. Would not go to any other make its my 2nd Ford had a Peugeot in the middle and will not be going back 

Love my car"
2312, a year ago,4,"I own a Ford F-150 FX4 and I love it.  There is a lot of room in the back seat which is not all that common. My truck gets good fuel mileage and is a very smooth drive.  I also love the way it looks. I wish the price wasn't so high, but I would buy it again."
2313, a year ago,4,"Good economy car, great gas mileage and decent speed. Easy and fun to drive but it kind of looks like a toaster on wheels. Very affordable depending on what model you choose, I would recommend."
2314, a year ago,4,"Too small for my comfort, but I feel they run well and last for a very long time if kept up right."
2315, a year ago,4,I absolutely love my escape. I got it from someone who really neglected it so I had to rebuild and replace almost everything under the hood and between the tires but I love it so much it was worth it
2316, a year ago,4,I looove my escape. Just got the 2020 and it’s the best escape yet! So comfy and rides well. I would recommend for anyone. Very affordable
2317, a year ago,5,Comodisimo y moderno. Un carro espacioso y económico en gasolina. Una linea para chicos!!! Lo recomiendo
2318, a year ago,5,I love my little focus it gets up and goes when I want but also can be just a little go to town car to and it’s just me so I have no left of room to move things and everything and it gets great gas mileage to!
2319, a year ago,5,"I love my car. I use it daily to go to my two jobs.  it's limited, full team. their spare parts are expensive. They must improve that the car does not have so many mechanical failures es I recommended"
2320, a year ago,5,"Me encanta..mi coche es ford scape 2013 y aún si confort y belleza me hace sentir que ando en un coche de año..es súper linda, espaciosa y su juego de colores...todo un sueño"
2321, a year ago,4,I love that it takes $28 to fill up my gas. I love the mileage. Transmission could use some work.
2322, a year ago,5,"Excelente auto , muy bueno para los viajes largos. Sus repuestos son muy buenos , su calidad en motor es excelente, su revisión no es de hacerse muy a seguido por la buena calidad de sus accesorios y repuestos, además su consumo de gasolina es mínimo. 100% recomendado"
2323, a year ago,5,"I love this car. Its easy to handle, has a big boot for mums with bubs, and good fuel economy. 
It has everything I need, even my husband loves to drive it.
 Ford Escape"
2324,a year ago,5,"Ufff espectacular este carro,me encanto me gustaría tener uno,sería genial,muy ligero"
2325, a year ago,4,We’ve enjoyed our Ford Escape. We used to have a Chevy Equinox and this is a similar vehicle from ford. We recently took a 5+ hour road trip and comfortably fit 4 adults plus luggage. Overall I’d say it’s a great vehicle.
2326, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford fusion. I was so sad to hear Ford won't be making cars anymore. It is so comfortable for me to drive, b ut since I work.from home my husband does ml out of the driving. He loves all the space and headroom. I have a sunroof and he is 6'3 and still doesn't hit his head."
2327, a year ago,4,My grandma always drove this car so I can’t really rate my own experience. It lasted them over 10 years and was a good little car
2328, a year ago,1,Insane amount of transmission issues from the beginning and tons of recalls on almost of their models.
2329, a year ago,4,"Pretty nice car, it has everything someone needs. An AC, GPS and Windows ahahahahahah that’s pretty important."
2330, a year ago,5,Wonderful sporty car. It was reliable and got me from point a to point b. I love all ford products and this was the second of three ford cars I have driven and owned. They follow their warranties and have always made sure the customer was treated fairly.
2331, a year ago,5,My mom just purchased a 2020 Ford Fusion. That car is sharp. Ford has really stepped up their game on the Ford Fusion. It’s got a nice sporty look to it. It’s very affordable. I would recommend this car.
2332,a year ago,2,Crappy car. Don’t recommend. Had so many problems with it and it doesn’t get good mileage and it gets dirty so easily and I could go on and on about how much it sucks.
2333,a year ago,3,Good car... Bad in the snow or on wet surfaces for that matter . Drives well and the inside is spacious... However the ac/heat busted in both of my fusions
2334,a year ago,2,"Not a fan of these cars. They look extremely cheap and not worth their high price. Once they lose value, after a couple years, they would make a great first car for 16 year olds! But overall I am not a fan of Ford."
2335,a year ago,5,"excelent, elle moin consomatrice du carburant, elle a un look incroyable, ses roues motrices resistent au froid/chaleur, son moteur est puissant, sa boite de vitesse est bien synchronisé est fluide au moment d'engrenage, son embryage est tres souple, sa suspenssion et ses accessoires la rendent plus confortable."
2336, a year ago,3,"I’m not sure what it is about the fusion line but it’s probably one of the most disappointing I’ve tried. It’s like the parts easily “fall apart” or are poorly made. It’s one of those if it’s not one thing, it’s another vehicles. Save your time and money."
2337, a year ago,5,"I had a coworker who have me rides in her ford focus. Have to admit it was nice keyless entry, heated seats, heated steering wheel, car could Bluetooth, start your car without being outside during winter. It was a sweet car."
2338, a year ago,5,My Ford Explorer was punished. 100 mile commute everyday. Taking kids to work or sporting events. On top of everything else my son-in-law plowed it into an old Cadillac and had slight damage. I loved this SUV.
2339, a year ago,2,I'm honestly not happy with Ford or their vehicles. They are liars and scam artists and trick buyers i to buying cars . Will never own a Ford again.
2340, a year ago,3,"The trim level is the real determining factor for this vehicle! I had a loaner car from a dealership, so it wasn’t the same type of ride I’m accustomed to in my own car. The more fancy versions are much nicer but the vehicle I had was perfect for short trips around town!"
2341, a year ago,3,My only complaint with this car was that the front seats were not electric. Everything else in the car was electric. 
2342, a year ago,5,"I have a 2018 F-150 XLT and I torally love it. Good on cas and love the eco-friendly options that I can select from while driving. The inside is so big its as large as a sedan. 

***sorry I couldnt find a better picture. ****"
2343, a year ago,3,"Its a very good economical car. No more that $20 to fill up the tank, and has been the most reliable car I have owned."
2344, a year ago,5,"Beautiful full size sedan, comfortable to drink in the city and on the road, hight power engine with low fuel consumption, elegant and stylish design"
2345, a year ago,5,"Great medium size sedan for the whole family, good millage per gallon on the road and in the city, elegant design"
2346, a year ago,5,"Best value car, high millage per gallon and very comfortable on the road, very reliable car overall on the stock all the way to the fully equipped version."
2347, a year ago,2,This car was always at the dealer or had something being recalled. I was able to fit a surprising amount of stuff in the trunk. There are so many thing that need to be improved about this vehicle.
2348, a year ago,5,"Love my car, it fits my children in it nicely. Could be a little more leg room but all in all its a great little SUV. Does good on gas too."
2349, a year ago,5,"Never had any issues with it. Small car, good on gas. Fits my needs and gets me where I need to go. My only complaint would be the recalls,, but those were fixed promptly and correctly the first time, so that's a win.  Will be my first bought and paid off car! Wooooo"
2350, a year ago,5,"I love my car! Has everything I need, looks pretty and it’s AWD. Leather seats are great & the stereo sounds awesome."
2351,a year ago,3,"Amo este auto, siempre cuando tengo oportunidades de alquilar siempre eligió este. Lo amo, nunca e tenido problemas es súper como lo recomiendo mucho"
2352, a year ago,5,Love this car. This is my second Ford Fusion and they are so reliable. Has mileage is so good. I’ve never had issues with them. Affordable and perfect for my kids and I. I drive it daily and wouldn’t trade it for anything.
2353, a year ago,5,For a small car these are great reliable cars. Easy to drive and affordable. Relatively low cost to repair and the parts are easily attainable. A fiesta was the second car I ever owned.
2354, a year ago,1,Terrible handling in the snow. Car sits way too low to the ground. One front end accident to my windshield washer reserve and the car was totaled. No damage to hood or tire well. Must’ve been made on a Monday.
2355, a year ago,5,"I quite like the Ford Escape for a number of reasons. It has a beautiful and spacious interior, is a nice sized for a smaller suv."
2356, a year ago,5,We had a Fusion Titanium as a rental for a month and this car was amazing!!! All the bells and whistles included and handled like a dream. Great vehicle for the whole family and was very road trip perfect!
2357, a year ago,5,I have had a Ford eco boost for 4 years and literally never had a problem. Only@thing I have had to do is top up the air con. Great reliable car with good fuel efficiency
2358, a year ago,5,The Ford Escape is a really great car. It always made me feel safe and comfortable when driving and even as a passenger.
2359, a year ago,1,We had a 2005 Ford Fusion when I was in high school and the thing was a damn nightmare. It was our newest car but it had the most problems out of all of them. It would randomly die in the middle of the street and even though we got the ignition fixed multiple times you had to start the car with the auto start and then put the key in or it wouldn’t start.
2360, a year ago,5,"It is a very spacey car, has a great back up camera. Have never had a problem with it. Parts are fairly easy to find."
2361, a year ago,5,"I love this car, when I have the opportunity to rent a car, I always chose this one.  It is great for long trips, comfortable and extremely smart.  To improve it maybe a bit more comfortable on the inside maybe more lumbar support.  Other than that this is a great car. "
2362,a year ago,4,It is from one of the renowned brand in its range of segment.it does offer good mileage and the dynamics of this model is quite impressive. Good for city cruising and also good for hill driving.yes would definitely recommend others.
2363, a year ago,3,"2012 Ford Focus SE, its small but not tiny, my biggest complaint is Ford messed up the transmission module in fusions, focus', and Fiestas for a few years and the transmission module will go out. Mine went out once already and my husbands has went out 2x, his focus is a 2013. Luckily they added a 10 year warranty through ford since they cannot actually fix the issue."
2364, a year ago,5,My husband has 2018 mustang and he loves it even though he doesn't drive it as much. It's a beautiful blue color.
2365, a year ago,5,"I've been a owner of two mustangs, a 2006 and a 1996 and I loved them both!! I ended up giving my car to my husband once his car died, but I really do enjoy my ford mustangs!! "
2366, a year ago,2,OK car. I have not heard great reviews on Fords. I have heard that they have alot of mechanical problems. I do like how this is made in the USA though.
2367, a year ago,5,I love my vehicle! It is amazing and is great for handling on and off road. Plus the towing package is definitely a plus!
2368, a year ago,4,"Cute car the 2019 has really nice features, I would highly recommend for a family car. Drives nice with a screen inside. "
2369, a year ago,4,I mean it is ok. Not really spacious I would like more room but for everyday use i think that it is fine. Not that i dont use it trust me i use it everyday but maybe more space would be the only thing for sure.
2370, a year ago,4,Nice and comfortable vehicles. My fiance owned a Ford when we first got together and it was great to get from point A to B. The only down side was there was not a lot of room inside the truck but it was still comfy.
2371, a year ago,3,"2012-2013 Ford Fusion – Appearing on Consumer Reports' Best Used Cars list, the Ford Fusion is a definite family car consideration. Best years for reliability are 2012 and 2013, while 2008-2009 and 2011 is just one notch below The Fusion offers great value for new car buyers and also offers great standard and optional features. The Fusion also offers car buyers their choice of four engines Ford Fusion"
2372, a year ago,3,"Fords break down a lot. Trunk leaks and we don't know why... honestly it's my 2nd Ford, my first was a Taurus '94 and I loved it but our fiesta is crap."
2373, a year ago,5,"Very comfortable and fast car.I like road trips with it, we got Ford Escape in California road trip.It doesn’t need a lot of gasoline"
2374, a year ago,5,I think they are beautiful and very nice cars. They have a lot of space since I’m 6ft. I really have nothing bad to say because I don’t own one but from driving in one they are very nice
2375, a year ago,3,I owned a Ford focus many years ago and it was a very nice vehicle but once I upgraded to a Ford suv there was no turning back
2376, a year ago,4,I love the Ford escape. I have leased two of them. They drive very smoothly and do great in snow. I recently upgraded to the explorer
2377, a year ago,5,"Good reliable car. I don't drive but me and my boyfriend bought this car back in 2013 when it was new, (have since traded it in) we took a bunch of trips in it and never had one problem with anything. Since then the door latch has been recalled, but we never had a problem with the latches. It's a great car, if your looking at buying a ford the focus it a safe reliable vehicle."
2378, a year ago,5,My family and I just upgraded from a 2014 Escape with the 2.0 turbo to the 2020 3cyl turbo and we are extremely happy! That absolutely packed this thing with functional technology and style! At first we were apprehensive about the smaller engine but the performance difference is barely noticeable from our last Escape. I’m sure the new 2.0 is much better but we are extremely happy with the 3cyl and the gas mileage. It is very comfortable and roomier then the previous
2379, a year ago,5,Honesthad it as a loner car while my jeep was getting fixed and I loved driving this.
2380, a year ago,5,"It’s a hybrid car, and I love that I can use gas or electricity to run it. It’s kind of smaller than regular gas cars so it could feel a little cramped. However they are comfortable in other aspects."
2381, a year ago,2,"I've never been a big FORD fan, as we like to say FORD stands for Flip Over Read Directions. Fords tend to always need a lot of work. They are always going into the shop for something. They aren't cheap to buy, or to fix. I personally wouldn't recommend to anyone. Unless of course you found one ridiculously cheap, you need to save the rest of the money for repairs"
2382,a year ago,5,Great car not the best in gas but that is all good. The car is cute. Just wish the gas was better to save a few bucks lol
2383, a year ago,5,"Very reliable, very spacious, drives great in the snow. Sleek and affordable. Very great gas mileage"
2384,a year ago,5,Tiene un diseño confortable y fiable para el usuario me gusta la su diseño ergonómico y tiene unos acabados muy buenos las llantas so muy duraderas y confiables
2385,a year ago,5,Great on gas mileage and having 4 wheel drive is a bonus as well. It looks nice and has plenty of space for storage. I would improve this car by giving it better towing capacity.
2386, a year ago,2,"This is an old one so there are no bells and whistles not even automatic door locks very basic model but it runs, lol."
2387, a year ago,5,Me@encanta la marca Ford . Siempre he tenido varios modelos a lo largo de mi vida y voy a seguir con la misma línea ya que me resulta lindo confortable y la@mecanica es muy buena
2388, a year ago,5,"Amo viajar en mi auto, aunque es un poco viejito estoy contenta con la mecánica y además es súper confortable. Cuando llegue el momento de cambiarlo elegiré el mismo pero un modelo más nuevo."

2390, a year ago,5,My mom drives a 2012 fusion fully loaded. The car drives very smooth and the the heated seats are very nice for cold mornings. She got her car for a deal since a new body style was coming out the next year but over all decent on price.
2391,a year ago,4,"Thé car is good, especially the sport version of this one. It is comfy and it does its work. I don’t personally like the design, but it’s cool and allows you to park easily in narrow places, especially in big towns"
2392, a year ago,4,Muy bonito cómodo  con mucho espacio práctico  m gusta la seguridad que tiene para niños unos bonitos rines y palanca de velosidades práctica  recomendable para una familia el aire acondicionado no hace tanto ruido
2393, a year ago,1,Trash I had to drive this car for work and I hated it. Power wasn’t there. Only plus side was good gas everything else trash
2394,a year ago,5,"After totaling my BMW X5, I was in the market for another luxury SUV as I have 2 kiddos I carry around all the time. So I needed to fit 2 car seats with extra space to pack and have an additional member in the car, the escape is just that! Luxury enough without being too fancy for kids, with enough space to fit 5 comfortably!"
2395, a year ago,5,It’s a great car for getting to work and back and even a few road trips have been great in this car!
2396, a year ago,2,"My mom and dad both drive this vehicle, I believe the car is a nightmare. Both of them have problems with the steering column. One car makes a funny sounds when you turn either direction and the other experiences a shaking movement on the road while driving. Just being in the car with both of them I would never buy this vehicle."
2397, a year ago,5,"Very smooth driving, has a sports engine which is nice for fast drivers, screen likes to time out sometimes though"
2398,a year ago,1,Worst car I ever owned. Terrible customer service and false advertisement. It ended up being a lemon and there was a class action lawsuit against Ford because of this car.
2399, a year ago,5,"the date. The car is a gem of cars. It has great features like power, balance, comfort, fuel economy, low maintenance. I own the diesel titanium version which provides 2 airbags and makes you feel secure. I am getting a mileage of 23-25 km/lit on highways after having completed 3rd service."
2400, a year ago,5,"Promises to be packed with equipment, safety features and looks a lot better than before. However, the compact car market has undergone a complete change in the recent past"
2401, a year ago,5,"I have the 2019 titanium edition and I love it. Very roomy, has all the safety features, and a sun roof. It’s decent on gas mileage and handles great in bad weather"
2402, a year ago,5,"Excelente carro, me encantan los colores que manejan, corre súper bien y es visto como uno de las mejores marcas"
2403, a year ago,5,"Excelente carro, es espacioso, corre súper bien, tiene asientos muy cómodos, los colores son increíbles"
2404, a year ago,4,A Focus was my first car and I loved it! It had great gas mileage and I felt very safe driving it. It had a lot of trunk space for a sedan too.
2405, a year ago,5,"I choose this brand, it is finer, it is a higher category, because the models are more impressive and attractive and in terms of history the brand has a greater representation worldwide and they mostly manufacture trucks which I love!tops the list of car brands just great"
2406, a year ago,5,My sister has a Ford Fusion hybrid and it is a fantastic car!!! It is very roomy and has amazing gas mileage. I highly recommend this car!!
2407, a year ago,1,I hate it so much it's so hard to work and us way to expensive for what you get. A pro is that it is high tech but a con us hoe expensive it is. I would improve it by making it easier to drive
2408, a year ago,3,"It's a really good car and dosnt tend to break down. It's really expensive to keep on running as I have to pay for my insurance, tax, petrol and my mot. It can be expensive to purchase a car brand new but you can usually find them pretty cheap second hand."
2409, a year ago,5,"Looks like a luxury car, the interior is amazing and very high tech considering the price point."
2410, a year ago,5,I love Ford Mustangs. My first car I ever had was a Mustang GT convertible and I never had any problems with it. I got a great deal through Ford Motor Credit and my car never had any issues and was in great condition. I would go car shopping here again. I recommend.
2411, a year ago,5,"This is my favorite SUV. I had the 2017 model, and it had comfortable seating, good gas-mileage, and I did not encounter any issues. It drove smoothly, and was a reliable car. I loved the touch screen and the sound system. The main thing that I would change is that it feels more cramped in the front of the car, but towards the back, there is more space since it is wider. It is perfect for a college student, and worked well in the winter weather."
2412, a year ago,3,It’s a nice car.  Just not a fan of fords.  Not enough space in the back seat. Super crammed with car seats
2413, a year ago,5,"Mi Ford fiesta es del 2009 y me encanta, es una buena marca los accesorios o cualquier pieza es cara pero vale la pena su calidad es exelente"
2414, a year ago,4,A step down from the explorer a little less room but still very comfy and tommy enough for a small family.
2415, a year ago,3,It’s perfect for a single individual for a first car. Seating is too crammed. Not enough space.
2416, a year ago,5,I love my escape!!! I’ve had it for four years now & I haven’t had to do any outrageous repairs! Perfect size for a family of four! Also nice because the seats can be put down to accommodate more trunk storage if needed!
2417, a year ago,5,"carro confortavel eu não tenho mais já andei, bom ar , boa janelas e portas, super recomendo , meu pai kkk"
2418, a year ago,3,"Cabin is very small, uncomfortable for tall people. Little leg room and not for disabled people who need room for a foldup walker."
2419, a year ago,5,I have a bad back and this car is the perfect hight for me I don't have to clime or lower myself into this car
2420, a year ago,5,"My housemate owns a fairly new focus and it's been a wonderful little workhorse for our student home. 
Not only does it take us to the shops and out on trips, but has moved us in and out of new homes well due to the large space in the back. All 5 of us can comfortably fit in the car with bags, which is helpful if we're going out or getting picked up after classes. 
While the car doesn't belong to me, I've spent plenty of time in it and it's a fantastic drive. We live in a fairly rural area and it's great on uneven roads and is small enough to navigate the local city roads without a problem. It's rarely filled with petrol and drives for *miles* without needed to be filled up again. 
It's a great little car and I fully intend on buying one myself once I'm driving!"
2421, a year ago,3,"Every fiesta I've been in has been either a first or second car because they're cheap and readily available. 
Quite often, you'll get a small problem and then all of a sudden, more will pop up! Due to this experience, I would probably still buy one but newer in hopes that I could avoid the problems related to older cars. 
These are still suitable as a family car as they're usually 5 doors or still large enough with 3 to accommodate a full family. Being smaller than a focus, they tend to be cheaper to run or owned by couples and single people."
2422, a year ago,5,My fiancé has a newer version of this and I absolutely love how it drives I drive it from time to time gets great gas mileage good seating good space great gadgets on the inside great speakers just a good car for transportation

2429, a year ago,3,It's been a decent car. we've had a few problems with it. Recently the AC went out which isn't good these hot summer months
2430, a year ago,5,I actually have an explorer but the app wouldn’t let me search and find explorer. But! I have owned a escape before my explorer and loved it! It was just the right size for me and my daughter. Drive well and felt sporty enough yet safe.
2431, a year ago,5,My 2016 ford fusion is an amazing car that is great on gas but is extremely roomy for being a decent size car.
2432, a year ago,4,Generally love Ford Motor Company!  Have had several Ford vehicles through out the years.Usually very reliable and nice to drive.
2433, a year ago,3,"Loved my Focus until the transmission went out.  Was fast and left me stranded.  Dealership wanted way too much to fix, and that was correcting the recall piece as well.  Buy a 2017 or newer if you do, . Actually very good vehicle before mechanical issues."
2434, a year ago,5,"Ideal model and material for the city I love it is perfect for my family, the model that we have in automatic and it is more practical for me the trunk has enough space to put everything from the supermarket, if you are looking for a car to start your family life and save on gasoline you must weigh in a Ford focus"
2435, a year ago,5,I love riding in this. The size was scary at first but I loved it. It is so spacious and easy to take out. I absolutely feel comfortable. It drives great. Gives me a great experience.
2436, a year ago,5,My daughters very first car was a Ford escape and she absolutely loved it for a young girl it was a perfect automobile easy to maintain and to fix and she loved it.
2437, a year ago,5,Good small reliable car it gets great gas mileage it’s really good for long distance driving if you were to take a road trip across the USA
2438, a year ago,5,Just great car... Saves me about 500 pounds a year on tax and petrol comparing to previous car. Driving ford focus last 7 years and never had any issues.
2439, a year ago,1,"This vehicle is awful. Not sure if it’s because it’s a ford but the heater only worked when it wanted too, it almost blew up, and overheated would continuously die. Rented from Enterprise Rent A Car. Terrible."
2440, a year ago,5,"Es un carro muy comodo para viajar, económico en combustible, apto para la familia, su interior es muy bonito, la cajuela es bastante amplia"
2441, a year ago,5,"I honestly love my escape! Drives and handles well. Nice and roomy inside. Mine is only front wheel, wish I could have gotten the all wheel drive option. These cars are very affordable and are actually quite nice"
2442, a year ago,4,"Me encanta mi camión, de la mecánica noble, muy económico y muy seguro. Creo que podría mejorar aún más la seguridad"
2443, a year ago,2,2015 with known transmission problems Company would not fix. Do not recommend for anyone looking for a dependable vehicle
2444,a year ago,2,Under powered! Great on gas! Cheap interior materials. Driving through hills will kill it. I was driving through mountains in Washington and the trans was burning up and this car had 30k miles on it! Would recommend to a college kid or someone just going around town definitely not ideal for road trips or families!
2445,a year ago,3,Car handles well! Great on gas! I would recommend to a small family of maybe 3 or 4. Trunk space could be a little better! Transmission is very very lunky and shifts are hard. Other then the transmission seems like a solid car!
2446, a year ago,4,I rented this car for a girl's night out and I have to say it's a really nice car. The drive is smooth on local and a tad loud on the freeway. Was a pleasant drive and would recommend if a possible choice of rental
2447, a year ago,5,"Loved driving the Ford Escape! I had the opportunity a while back when I borrowed my grandmas escape when my car broke down. It’s so zippy and gets great gas mileage. Also looks really sharp driving down the road, and a good price!"

2449,a year ago,5,I loved the space it was just enough for my family and well I loved the technology simply the back up camera. There’s really not much to say negative about it. Very affordable and definitely glad that I bought it
2450, a year ago,2,The car is quite comfortable but it's mileage is still not good. And moreover the car looks like garlic bread. It's shape is more different than any other cars.
2451, a year ago,1,The ford I was given as a Rental was not kept and it actually needed to be towed after 30 miles into my trip.
2452, a year ago,5,Roomy and smooth to ride in. Very cool and modern interior. Phone connects really well to the car
2453, a year ago,5,Perfectly little car for going around town. Had the best gas mutant doesn’t take a lot to fill the tank.
2454, a year ago,5,Most comfortable drive! Absolutely love this car! It’s so good on gas mileage and amazing for long trips
2455, a year ago,3,"decent gas mileage for an SUV. rides smooth & cruise control is easy to handle. trunk isn’t that big for an SUV. push to start is nice, but not if you’re used to using a key in the ignition! nice exterior & a good size"
2456,a year ago,5,It’s a nice sized vehicle with lots of room to transport big items. It drives nice and comes with great features. It’s an affordable option and looks sporty. My mom’s Ford Escape has 4 wheel drive and drives really well in the snow.
2457, a year ago,3,Transmission was not made well and will have to be repaired because it shakes. The AC doesn’t hit my face when driving and makes my hands really cold. The frame on the sides of the windshield are too thick. The Bluetooth a is great feature.
2458, a year ago,2,"Not a fan of Ford vehicles. We use them for our fleet at work, but there is always something wrong with the vehicles. Just personally don’t car for the cars."
2459, a year ago,5,I love my car it's amazing I don't know what I would do with out it I'm very blessed to have a good working car.
2460, a year ago,5,Amazing drive!! Very smooth and love all the customisable options when purchasing a brand new fiesta. 
2461, a year ago,4,Great reliable car easy to drive and cheap to run but I hate the noise the fan makes you can hear me coming from a mile off
2462, a year ago,5,My husband drives this car and really likes it. He’s tall and there’s lots of leg room in the front. That’s important to him. We’ve had the car for two years now. Recently there was some sorta recall with the engine but Ford took total care of the problem and gave my husband a loaner while the engine was being replaced. Ford is a very reputable company and this is a nice car.
2463, a year ago,5,Honestly 10/10 experience with this car. Very easy and smooth to drive. It’s also very user friendly which I adore since I know nothing about cars.
2464,a year ago,5,"Beautiful little car for my first car.

Son grandes, comodos, un estereo excelente.. en el nuestro algunas fallas de AC y amortiguacion."
2467, a year ago,5,"Nice and smooth to ride, love the color of the car and the gas was cheap so it’s not to much to own."

2472, a year ago,2,My boyfriends Ford Focus has lived a decent life but has also had a lot of foxes needed
2473, a year ago,4,I’ve had a Ford Focus and it was a very enjoyable ride. A smaller car but it feels roomy and modern without a large price tag. This car also feels sporty! I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who needs an affordable and reliable car.

2476,a year ago,4,"Learned to drive in this car! Great tech, tells you the speed limits on the road your driving on and also tells you when to gear up or down which is great for a new driver. I have lots of friends who still drive fiestas and they seem to be good runners. The only reason why I gave this a 4 star is due to it not being as spacious as I would like, I have a golf which seems a lot bigger and has a lot more boot space"
2477,a year ago,4,"Really spacious, outside of car looks really good and the new screen update is great however I think the steering wheel style is really old fashioned"
2478, a year ago,5,"Had this car as a rental for about 2 weeks. It’s not a car for me, but it’s a very safe car. It’s great on gas, and the interior is clean looking."
2479, a year ago,5,I loved it but it was a older version . It got me from point a to point b . Never really had a problem with it
2480,a year ago,5,Got a Ford Focus as a rental car this past summer. It rode very smoothly and I was impressed with its speed capabilities! It was also extremely fuel efficient which is always a bonus. I have a Ford already and I love their dependency
2481,a year ago,5,"As a passenger, spacious, clean and sleek. Not too small or too big. As a driver my 2014 fusion is a bit touchy, otherwise fine. I will admit the cloth seats do get dirty very fast, especially if you have the tan inside. Otherwise it's reliable and safe!"
2482,a year ago,5,For it being my new first dealership car...i absolutely love it! Wish the back was more spacious but it works for our small family! Maybe back ac control but I love how eco friendly it and how its easy to find information for the oil. The alerts and the navigation! Perfect Car for a small family! Or starter vehicle for your teen!
2483,a year ago,5,"Lo mejor en autos , son cómodos con gran espacio .adaptados para todo tipo de terreno , lo mejor en motor y super livianos"
2484,a year ago,4,"Es pequeño pero tiene buen maletero,, los asientos son comodos para viajes de tramos cortos. Colores brillantes, pintura poca durabilidad"

2489, a year ago,4,"My previous car was a 2010 Ford Focus. Newer focuses can have some serious transmission issues, so watch out. Mine was old enough to not be involved in that. The one thing I hated was the car would vibrate at idle. It was a very intense shaking."
2490, a year ago,4,Great vehicle. Lots of room and the all wheel drive is fabulous for Wisconsin winters!  Wish it got better gas mileage tho
2491, a year ago,5,"My wife loves this car. It is perfect for her and the kids. Small but lots of room for kids toys in trunk
easy to load In and out"
2492, a year ago,5,I rent one it was nice smooth ride and it sound like the car had a music system nice I wish I own it love the car !
2493, a year ago,5,"One of the most comfortable cars I’ve driven, and live the has mileage. The brakes take some getting used to, and would love more room in the backseat. Very affordable and would recommend to anyone."

2496, a year ago,5,My husband and I bought our daughter a 2019 Ford Fusion Hybrid last year and absolutely love it. She loves it and wants to drive it everywhere. I find we take it on trips more than we do our other ford vehicles. It’s comfortable and gets great gas mileage and I absolutely love all the safety features it has.
2497,a year ago,5,I love my white 2012 Ford Escape! The seats are very comfortable and I like the way the car drives in general.
2498, a year ago,4,"Great car! Very solid, I would approve of Ford's motto: Like a Rock.  Dependible, worry-free, and excellent value.  The engine is strong, even after 5 years of ownership. Repairs are minimum, parts are readily available and labor costs are low. (2008, Ford Focus SE)"
2499, a year ago,5,"Really reliable, easy inexpensive maintenance. Gets me where I need to go, and it looks cute!"
2500, a year ago,5,I have had two ford fusions & love them! I currently drive a 2017 & it always gets me where I need to go. Other than oil changes I have had 0 issues with the car & it has been a great purchase! This is an excellent & affordable car for any young college student. The gas mileage is incredible!
2501, a year ago,1,worst car I've seen in a long time... it's not worth even considering if you ask me... anytime I see someone looking to buy one of these cars I tell them to run the other way

2505, a year ago,5,I own a 2011 Ford Focus and it has been such a dependable car. I drive back and forth from NY to Boston often for work and the gas mail he is great and it’s a very safe care to have.
2506, a year ago,4,The Ford Escape was the first SUV/Crossover I ever owned. I like that it’s not too big or small and doesn’t eat up a lot of gasoline like a full size SUV would. It’s big enough to seat 5 and still have room in the back for groceries or a mid sized pup. I would recommend if seeking something bigger than a car
2507, a year ago,4,"Es un excelente auto en la relación precio y Calidad. De ser necesario algún tipo de repuesto, en Argentina es muy fácil de conseguir y a precios totalmente accesibles los repuestos originales. Mi mecánico de confianza siempre recomienda autos Ford"

2513, a year ago,5,"I like the space in the front and the trunk too, I like that it is comfortable and very safe, is a good option for a first car"
2514, a year ago,5,I LOVE my Ford Escape! I feel safe when I’m driving it to and from each destination. It has a lot of great space for passengers as well as in the trunk. The A/C is powerful and cools/beats quickly. I also love how effective and easy to use the display is.
2515, a year ago,5,"Excelente para viajes largos y cortos, para ti y tu familia. Muy cómoda y de excelente calidad, perfectos amortiguadores es lo mejor se los recomiendo mucho 😉"
2516, a year ago,4,I love this car. Used it through college. Just keeps getting recalls that I forget about
2517, a year ago,5,I was extremely surprised how well this 4 door midsize car performed. Highly recommended No complaints. Excellent reliability and low cost maintenance. Strong brakes and taut yet comfortable suspension. Transmission very intuitive with shifts. Very quiet and secure on the highway. Excellent fuel economy and refined Engine. Passing and merging no problem. ONLY issue is the rear view is hard to see when backing out.  Other than that an excellent drive.
2518,a year ago,5,I love my ford escape.  It has always held up with very little issues.  It has great mileage and is the perfect size for our family of four.

2521, a year ago,5,"I purchased my fusion in 2015 New it is a 2016 Ford Fusion black with black leather interior, fully tinted with black rims. The car was very affordable it was the first car I purchased and it has proven to have longevity and drive wonderful. Mine was near fully loaded with features that have got me safely on many road trips and days going to the office. Very spacious and I have had very little problems with my car."

 Plain and simple. Sorry not sorry. There is absolutely nothing I like about this car"

2531, a year ago,5,The Ford Fusion is the first car I purchased on my own. I love every feature of this car. My backup camera and Sirius radio are two of my favorite features. It was reasonably priced and I would recommend this cafe to anyone. I had two Ford Focus before this one.
2532, a year ago,3,"Interior seems a bit cramped and the media screen is small, the control panel is ugly and big and a bit hard to operate but it gets good mpg and is nice looking on the outside"
2533, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Escape I had owned a Jeep before and always had problems. But with my escape I don’t have any problems and my car is amazing!
2534, a year ago,4,Enjoyed driving this recently as a rental. Enough so race to comfortably seat my family of 4 with enough room for luggage. Drove nicely.
2535, a year ago,5,Ford Fiesta has a special place in my heart. I have a passion for a small cute cars and it started with Ford Fiesta ❤️
2536, a year ago,3,el ford a demás de ser una carro cómodo es bastante económico para lo que ofrece no he tenido el gusto de conducirlo pero me estado de copiloto muchas veces y este lugar es muy cómodo nos permite tener viajes largos y es bastante económico en combustible. 
2537,a year ago,1,"I purchased a 2014 Ford Escape SE Ecoboost.  
The car started overheating and was leaking coolant.
A Ford dealership said the car needed a new engine at a cost of over $9,000....it had less than 15,000 miles...the vehicle sat in a protected garage and was used primarily on the weekends for town trips.  To have to replace an engine with less than 15,000 miles is ridiculous...clearly the engine was defective.  But neither Ford nor the dealership would do anything to help and wouldn't negotiate any kind of financial assistance.  Ford hides behind their warranties and policies instead standing behind their products...and there's no customer service escalation.  Don't ever buy a Ford because dealing with the company is impossible and useless...they don't care to stand behind their products and they don't care to try to keep or help customers.  Look to another manufacturer altogether for your car.  "
2538, a year ago,5,This car was nice. It has comfortable seats and a nice screen display. It is the perfect size for a crossover too
2539, a year ago,3,"A good affordable car that rarely needs mechanical repairs. The road noise on the highway is the main reason I traded her in, but she had over 130,000 miles when my daughter finally gave her up. I can recommend as a starter car for anyone on a budget."
2540, a year ago,5,This car gets great gas mileage. It drives really smoothly. It’s roomy for a car as I’m use to driving a truck. Plenty of leg room. This car is very affordable. I would recommend this car to people who like to save money on gas.
2541,a year ago,5,"I will drive this baby until the wheels fall off. I am at ten years and counting. When I got the car, I wasn’t great about upkeep, but I’ve gotten much more consistent. It runs well and is great in gas. This is my baby!"
2542, a year ago,5,"it’s extremely safe and build for safety. I had a really bad accident in my 2012 focus, car was completely totaled and gas tank punctured but I walked away without a scratch. My family was grateful and so was I that ford took the time to add certain safety features like 911 dialing. Beyond grateful "
2543,a year ago,4,"I really love my car! It's easy to drive in. The trunk is a bit small, so maybe not the best car if you have a big family"
2544, a year ago,5,"Este carro es realmente cómodo, bonito, elegante, amplio y cuenta con la última tecnología.

2547, a year ago,5,Very comfortable car and it is also very economical when driving for a long period of time
2548, a year ago,3,Maybe it was just the car but i didnt really enjoy driving this car as much. I felt like it was small for me. Am probably just used to bigger cars but its not enough space. I gave kids so definitely too small for us.
2549,a year ago,3,I love my little 2019 escape. This is my 2nd one due to them being leases. They aren’t big or roomy but the gas mileage is great and they are pretty dependable. The safety is there and the stereo in it is pretty good for factory. I have 3 large boys so this is quickly getting smaller and smaller. If your looking for a good car that doesn’t eat up gas this is it. Just remember it’s about as small inside as a car and the back seat isn’t very comfortable.
2550, a year ago,5,Este carro es súper lindo además son duraderos y salen muy pero muy buenos. Yo quiero comprarme pronto uno de estos
2551, a year ago,5,Muy bueno. Me encanta. Súper cómodo y seguro . Es confortable . Solo se recalienta un poco pero nada que no se pueda controlar

2555, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford. Very easy to drive. I love all of the features; back-up camera, seat warmer etc. I am a mom so i love the space. I would say this car is worth it and i would recommend this car to family and friends."
2556, a year ago,4,"A loud little car with a weird transmission jump. Maybe I had a weird car but this thing was a beast. Jumping when it shifted gears, ok on gas, loud hum of the engine."
2557, a year ago,3,"A very nice looking vehicle, I just feel like fords in general have a lot of maintenance problems."
2558, a year ago,5,"AMOOO con locura y pasión. Hace rato que estoy deseando comprarme. Ahora, en esta pandemia me es imposible y seria genial poder tener una para poder hacer la tarea del colegio y a mis papás se les hace un poco imposible. Porque no tienen un trabajo estable. En fin"
2559, a year ago,5,"AMOOO con locura y pasión. Hace rato que estoy deseando comprarme. Ahora, en esta pandemia me es imposible y seria genial poder tener una para poder hacer la tarea del colegio y a mis papás se les hace un poco imposible. Porque no tienen un trabajo estable. En fin"
2560, a year ago,5,"I have a 2 door 2007 hatchback Ford Focus SE and it’s my ol’ reliable. I recently got a new car an I’m going to be terribly sad getting rid of this car because it has never given me any issues driving from college back home, racking up the miles. Love this car and great on gas."
2561, a year ago,5,"We borrowed our friend Ford Escape for a family vacation! I actually loved it, I’m not really a Ford person. But it drives super smooth, very roomy!"
2562, a year ago,3,"I don’t like the trans, also I live in a hot weather .. this don’t work for me , I have many problems with the radiator"
2563, a year ago,5,My boyfriend drives a fusion and its such a smooth ride. The gas tank is twice the size as my car so we don’t have to fill up as often
2564, a year ago,4,The very first car I had and learned to drive in was a 2009 Ford Fusion. I had zero complaints for that car. I liked the more box like design that they had and am not a fan of the more recent designs.
2565, a year ago,5,I owned a 2011 Ford Fusion that I absolutely loved prior to a car accident that totaled my car in 2018.
2566, a year ago,5,"Muy espacioso y cómodo,ideal para salir con toda la familia y cargar hasta con los más pequeños. Llamativo a la vista ¡Genial!"
2567, a year ago,4,"My husband drives this hybrid as a daily driver. It gets excellent gas mileage, especially because it’s part electric. It doesn’t have the “pickup and go” that some cars do, but it’s an extremely smooth ride."
2568, a year ago,5,"We just got this car for me. I have never driven a compact SUV before, and I love it. It’s small enough to be easily maneuvered but big enough that I don’t feel like I’m going to get run off the road."
2569,a year ago,5,The escape is perfect for a small family however when you have a larger growing family this vehicle was not the best fit for our family. Safety rating is very high as it was totaled and suffered significant damages and I walked away with minimal injuries. I do wish that the 3rd row seating was a bit bigger but it is a good value for the money.
2570,a year ago,5,I absolutely love my Ford Fusion! I have actually owned two and even convinced my sister to buy one as well. I do not love the look of the new body style of the Fusions as much as the previous models but I know what great vehicles they make for a daily driver.
2571,a year ago,5,I had a 2011 Ford Escape and I absolutely loved that car. It was perfect for quick trips in town and always served every purpose we needed on road trips as well. I never had a single issue with the car outside of normal service checks.
2572, a year ago,5,Dependable and low cost maintenance. I love my escape and it’s easy to maintain so it will last several years.
2573, a year ago,5,"The Ford Fusion i drove was a rental, for a week while in Cali visiting Disney Land. It’s a fast little zippy car. Very compact and fits into every parking space which is very convenient."
2574,a year ago,5,"Es una pasada de coche. Para ser la opción más básica de la gama, tiene un montón de extras, con muchas comodidades y sobretodo facilidades de pago."
2575, a year ago,5,I own a 2008 Ford Escape hybrid. It has been my favorite car that I have driven so far. It is pretty reliable. It’s had it’s issues but overall nothing terrible. It gets great gas mileage and it is really easy to drive.
2576, a year ago,5,"Been having a Ford Fusion for 3 years now, and I love this car so much! If you’re looking for a car that’s affordable on gas and has a great amount of space inside this is definitely the car for you!"
2577, a year ago,4,Great car dependable if you enjoy a smooth ride this is the car for you I enjoy how spacious and comfortable this car is!￼
2578, a year ago,4,I’m not really a fan. Maybe it was the stripped down version I got at the car rental but the road noise was terrible!
2579, a year ago,4,It’s a nice car! Runs really good and is good on gas. The only issue I have is the gear shift is a round dial in the center console which is kinda weird but once you get used to it it’s not bad.
2580, a year ago,5,"Great crossover vehicle. Large hatch space, great space in back seats. Plenty of leg room in the back seats. Affordable, ok gas mileage. Lasts a long time when cared for. Really great car. The sun roof was great added addition also."
2581, a year ago,4,This was my previous car! I loved it. It was a great vehicle. The only issue for me was the back seat was a little to small for 3 car seats. So I had to upgrade to a larger vehicle. Other than that it was a great car! It road smoothly! Great gas mileage! Great interior style! Loved it!
2582, a year ago,3,Good for a first car or a car for your elderly parents. I have sold a few of these and always to older people. They love them but with the recalls I wouldn’t buy this vehicle for myself. They have lots of electrical issues
2583,a year ago,5,Probably my favorite car to date. Has just enough room for me and my family whenever we go places. Plus mine has an awesome sunroof!
2584, a year ago,5,My best friend had a 2011 and she put that thing through hell and it never gave out in her. I’m Chevy over ford but that car was a trooper
2585, a year ago,3,Good reliable car with good gas millage cons it is very plastic in the interior and slow engine
2586, a year ago,5,"Very good car, very comfortable and it has a lot of space! Good for everyday use and also good to travel with"
2587, a year ago,3,I prefer to own a ford vehicle above anything else but I currently own a 2000 Ford  Focus SE wagon and right at 80k I blew the head gasket and when we tore the motor apart we discovered that it also dropped the valve seat.  Upon trying to learn how to fix the car we found out that these cars are known to drop the valve seat right at 100k.  Upon finding that out I have decided that I will not being buying another ford
2588, a year ago,5,"For me, this car is everything I need. It is very spacious, extremely good on gas, and has a good sound system! It is smooth driving and heavy enough to where you feel safe while you’re on the road. I would definitely recommend as a family car!"
2589, a year ago,3,I feel as if this car is some what of a copy cat of a Ford Taurus. Most of the body shapes and styles of the interior seem to be about the same as the Taurus.
2590, a year ago,4,I drove a new Ford Fusion as a rental car when on vacation in Charleston. I loved all the new features the car offered. The Sport has good pick up and I didn’t feel like I was kissing anything.
2591,a year ago,4,"Love the car, sleek ￼aesthetically. I enjoy the heated seats in the winter time. Although from time to time the touch screen freezes and will glitch. I wish the buttons on the console were actually buttons you could push."
2592, a year ago,3,"This Ford Focus was a nice starter car, it was affordable, and great on gas. The only problem was is that the transmission gave out at about 40,000 miles. It was highly disappointing."
2593, a year ago,5,This is a very comfortable family car. It's roomy has a decent size boot. Affordable and reliable would trust this brand
2594, a year ago,5,I have a 2006 and I absolutely love my car! Definitely reliable for a 12 year old car!
2595, a year ago,4,Solid vehicle. Very dependable and easy to operate. Not the best gas mileage but never really had problems with it.
2596, a year ago,4,It’s a dependable car that sits up high. The features are staple and it is easy to learn and use. The price is fair and it is roomy and good for kids
2597, a year ago,3,Had one for a rental while my car was in shop. Very nice small car for the size. Would recommend highly.
2598, a year ago,5," Ford Escape Recently, I really have become fond of Fords.  And its because of this car that has all the bells and whistles."
2599, a year ago,1,"je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas, je n'aime pas, "
2600, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Fiesta, I have the green 2011 hatchback. It has lasted me well over the years. I bought this car when I was 21 and I’ve taken care of it very well. Replacement parts are cheap and it’s been a great car."
2601, a year ago,4,"This was my first car when I got my license back in 2008. I loved it, but once I switched to Honda I never looked back. I was in a not too serious car accident in my fusion, but it was definitely totaled"
2602, a year ago,5,The Ford Escape has been one of my favorite cars ever. It’s the perfect size midsize SUV. It is a beautiful car with a lot of nice features. I would recommend this car to anyone!
2603, a year ago,5,"It’s a nice car for the price point. It’s reliable and gets you where you need to go. It isn’t super fancy, but would be a great car for someone who just needs to go from point A to point B."
2604, a year ago,5,it is a very good car.  We have done long trips and it has not given us any kind of problem.  It is a very comfortable car and the interior is spacious.  I highly recommend it.
2605, a year ago,2,I have this car for my daily use everyday. I have a 2012 but I had so many problems with it. It is a lemon and I had to change the computer system 4 times and the transmission 8 times. Basically everything under the hood has been changed more than 4 times. It does great with gas and the air condition is great on the car.
2606, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Escape! It’s large enough to pack for a long road trip with both my kids and both my large breed dogs yet small enough that I fit easily in all parking spaces. Apple play is a nice touch!
2607, a year ago,5,"My car is a ford taurus 1998 it sat outside for about 3 years before i bought it. ive owned it for over two years ive had to do minimum repairs on it besides the brakes, wipers, oil changes, new tires, etc. But overall she hasnt let me down yet!:) i would recommend ford 👍"
2608, a year ago,4,I loved my Ford Escape. Was a great size and drove amazingly. Could fit everything I needed without feeling like I was driving a bus.
2609, a year ago,5,"A very comfortable and respectable car for reasonable money.  Fuel consumption is tolerable and LPG4 can be supplied, which makes travel on a budget.  The family is delighted.  Driving is affordable for women.  A huge trunk, just huge, with a height of 180 cm, you can hardly reach the depth.  Slightly harsh suspension on a bad road, but great on a flat track.  A set of safety and comfort features for a solid five.  The glove compartment is too small, and the shelf is also divided into two parts.  There is enough space on the back sofa for three.  Consumables at a reasonable price, only the cabin filter is expensive, but everything is relative.  Everything is reliable"
2610, a year ago,5,Great car. Runs beautifully. Nice size. Only con is the pedals are a little sensitive.
2611, a year ago,5,My Ford Escape has been the perfect car for our small family. I love how reliable it’s been & that I can be confident it’s keeping my family & I safe.
2612, a year ago,4,"Its a pretty good car, but it could be a bit more spacious. But, I love that it has a mini screen in the front."
2613, a year ago,2,"Ford is a well known brand and I expect more than a bland, 4 cylinder power train with an underwhelming interior. The engineers need to go back and add give this vehicle some horsepower and add some personality to the brand."
2614, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Fusion SE. My favorite features are the rotary shift gear and the rear view camera. It drives great and is very easy to control. I feel the car is at an affordable price point and wish that Ford wouldn’t stop production of this car.
2615, a year ago,5,"I absolutely LOVE my car.  I have the hybrid version and up until recently I was driving everyday, multiple times a day. It saved me so much money on gas driving this car, as it uses the battery when it can, and gas to accelerate, cooling and heating of course.  I love the look of it, I love how much room there was in it. I love everything about this car.  If they are still making it when I get a new one I will definitely buy one again.  In fact my husband is thinking about buying one, as he loves driving mine so much!"
2616, a year ago,3,I drove this car as a rental vehicle. I would say it as an average car. Doesn’t really have any wow features. Gives good mileage and its comfortable. Didn’t really nice the pick up though.If you looking for a affordable car its not a bad car .
2617,a year ago,2,Not a fan. My dads truck keeps breaking down. He has spent so much time and money into the truck he owns. He has no choice but to keep the vehicle at this time.
2618,a year ago,3,I'm not a big fan of Ford brand but it is a new change. So still testing out the brand and make of car. While on the subject I like the space we have in the vehicle. The radio features can be a bit confusing and hectic but still learning how to use everything.
2619, a year ago,5,"It is the perfect size for a car it is economy and comfy. It is elegant and luxury at the same time and you can be safe in it and drive it without problems, you can travel with 4 passengers and enjoy the car on the road"
2620, a year ago,4,Perfect size and it is comfy and luxury it is easy to drive and you feel comfortable in it. You can use it with all your family and take your kids in also you can put the chair kids there without problem
2621, a year ago,3,It’s a affordable car but can feel the difference in the drive not as strong. And the back up camera screen is very small and can not rely on it.
2622, a year ago,5,My favorite car that I’ve ever owned!! I am so in love with it. The cabin is huge for a small SUV and I love that the backseats go all the way down - allowing for ample storage. It is extremely roomy and holds up to whatever environment I’m in!
2623, a year ago,5,"SLEEK, SEXY, and SPORTY! This Machine right here is what changed my entire perspective on Ford Motors. I moved a roommate in with me several years back when I was about 20 and was going through some difficulties with my personal vehicle which was a Mercedes S class. My roommate let me borrow their car for the time being and I fell absolutely in love. My Benz couldn’t compare! The digital displays absolutely stunning, a large bright white screen with super sense ability to touch lights up the entire interior even illuminating the backseat￼. He’s came with a subscription to the XM radio so the tunes are a plus. Whipping and winding and handling curves like it was made for my Colorado roads, winding and weaving so precisely! ￼One of the most exciting things about the brand new fusion is those brakes baby! BRAKE em in! Typically newer cars have such touchy brakes if you barely top you come skating to a stop.￼ The Excelerator and brake have the perfect amount of resistance not where you tap and take off, or go to go and GOOOO! I love the Ford Fusion! On my Christmas list to gift myself this year! ￼￼￼"
2624, a year ago,5,It's good. Nice to drive and good condition for a long time. There is a few cons like the motor dont start after a while. Not much needs improvement. I recommend if you want it for your first car. (This isnt ly car it's my dad car I dont drive)
2625, a year ago,4,I think this is a great product and very reliable. Mine has a leather interior and is very sleek. I get good gas mileage and am overall very happy with this vehicle. It has lots of room in it and you can even lay the seats down for additional space. Very fun to drive!
2626, a year ago,3,Only ever driven it a couple times but I felt like the brakes were much harder/non-responsive than other cars I’ve driven.
2627, a year ago,3,"It’s alright. Let me start off by saying this is only my second car, and I’m 25. I bought it secondhand after getting rid of my Tahoe I got when I was 15. So far, I’ve had a lot of issues with it which makes me sad. There are a lot of codes being thrown off, and there are a lot of little cosmetic things that seem cheaply made inside the car. I own a 2010, and I just bought it in March to get me by. I’m giving it to my sister in a month or so after I get my Enclave. It’s an okay car to get from point A to point B, but I definitely don’t see myself taking any road trips in this."
2628, a year ago,1,Je n'aime pas du tout cette voiture autant pour le confort que pour la conduite ce n'est pas du tout mon truc
2629, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my car!! I bought it originally for its functionality but I have really fallen for how the car runs and the features that the fusion comes with. It’s very affordable on gas which is excellent for my bank account! And easy to maintain!!
2630, a year ago,5,This cars are great they are light weight and super easy to drive and I love the Bluetooth radio only downside is I ALWAYS have issues getting my phone to connect but once it does I love it.
2631, a year ago,4,I like having apple play but the 4 cyl is hard on the road. I think even the sport mode didn’t help with needing more power.
2632, a year ago,4,I like the Ford Escape it’s cute and stylish surprisingly roomy in the front I don’t know about the backseat.
2633, a year ago,5,Good solid little SUV. Could do a little better on gas but for an SUV it does ok. Only issue is this car is aluminum underneath and rusts easily. Mine is moderately rusted underneath and it only has about 30000 miles on it.
2634, a year ago,2,"I loved the car in the beginning! But Ford Focus has had a ton of issues across their models with transmissions, sadly mine included"
2635, a year ago,1,"This was the worst car I have EVER owned!! I would never own this car again. We had numerous problems with the transmission not shifting properly, this car was taken to the dealership on numerous occasion and was told nothing they could do! The last straw was when I was trying to get in the highway and the car wouldn’t shift we went that weekend to trade it off, but we did try to call the company and they only thing they did was offer the friends and family discount ! The car was brand new less than 50 miles when we drove it off the lot"
2636, a year ago,4,"My aunt owns one of these cars and it's fantastic. Its comfortable to sit in and easy to drive. I love the car a lot. It really is a wonderful car. Easy to maintain and easy to drive and learn. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great ""small"" car."
2637, a year ago,3,"My father used to own an Escape. I only drove it a handful of times but when I drove it it was great. Had lots of space, you never felt cramped. I would probably recommend this car to people with kids or a big family."
2638, a year ago,4,It was a great car. Belonged to my ex boyfriend. I was always excited when I got a chance to drive it. It had great features and plenty of space on the inside. I would recommend this car to anyone looking.
2639, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love this truck. It is so spacious and so luxurious although it is not an expensive car. I love the painting on the outside, everything about this car shows it’s made with quality materials. I’d buy this even if it wasn’t new because I know it’s a relatable car"
2640, a year ago,5,I have a 2018 Ford Fiesta and I love it 🥰 it’s perfect size for what I need in a car 🚘 I do wish I had power windows but I don’t and have gotten used to the it is a small car so it fits in small places which is nice it gets up and goes. Trunk space is nice.
2641, a year ago,5,i used to own a platinum escape. It was awesome. And lots of gadgets so much fun to drive. I would’ve kept it but my husband insisted we get a new car.￼
2642, a year ago,5,"Extremely comfortable and safe ride. Feel like I'm in a Charter plain when I'm in this car the upholstery is so luxurious and the leg room is amazing since im a tall person the leg room is of utmost importance to me

However the height xan be a little better  Ford Escape"
2643, a year ago,5,"it seems to me an excellent product I cannot complain it is a beautiful vehicle, and technological the truth 10 points"
2644, a year ago,3,"After needing her whole engine replaced 2 years after buying new, my mom has never wanted a new car more. After waiting 4 months for the new engine, she still has troubles with it. The only other person I know with the same vehicle is experiencing the same. The models are basic for the cost compared to competitors. This cars reputation is ruined in my eyes. 3 stars because AWD and (most of the time) gets you where you need to go."
2645, a year ago,4,"My boyfriends Ford Fiesta is not something I enjoy being a passenger in. It’s cramped and fairly basic even in the higher trims. However, he LOVES it. 40+ mpg and a comfortable drivers seat makes this the perfect commuter car."
2646, a year ago,4,I like the style of vehicle and being higher in the vehicle than I am in a car. The frustrating part is that my car dies if I have the trunk open with the engine off for more than a few minutes. Other than that I love it!
2647,a year ago,5,My Mom has a Ford Escape. It’s such a cute SUV. The features for the base model are great and the price isn’t bad
2648, a year ago,2,This car is way to small for me. Not idea for anyone with kids. However this small car does pack a punch and is a super smooth ride.
2649, a year ago,3,This is my first car purchase and it’s pretty good and gets me place to place. No complaints
2650, a year ago,3,"My favorite thing about my car is that it is paid off! My Ford has lasted me about 9 years so far, but there are so many little things wrong with it. Counting down the days until I trade it in."
2651, a year ago,1,This car was so unreliable. I constantly had recalls on this car that were very concerning. It was so light it felt like it would get blown off the road. I didn’t feel safe in it at all.
2652, a year ago,4,"Small, but smooth driving. Struggles to connect to newer model phones for music. Great gas mileage."
2653, a year ago,5,"I love my Escape! I have the Titanium model, so it’s fully loaded. It’s a small SUV, but has plenty of room for anything I need to haul."
2654, a year ago,4,"Very nice car , hubby drives it but it is a nice smooth ride have zero complaints with this vehicle"
2655, a year ago,5,Live love love my car. When my baby gets too old to drive I’ll def get another focus.
2656, a year ago,4,"This is a great car, but it does not get very good gas mileage. For the amount that I drive I would prefer something better on gas but this car has plenty of room for two car seats and both adults!"
2657,a year ago,3,It is a good car. Dont like the fact that is not too tall and keeps hitting everything with the front part. Ford could improve that on newer versions.
2658,a year ago,3,"Good car, quiet driving but see sometimes garage for funny problems.
................."
2659, a year ago,5,"this product is the best! the packaging is on point. i am a first time customer and and would definitely recommend this product to my friends, family and anyone who needs it. i will definitely be back to buy more."
2660, a year ago,4,This is literally the same thing as the focus with the exception of a tad bit more foot space and a tad more head space.
2661, a year ago,2,This car is way too small for anything or anyone. I am 5’10” so using this vehicle made it almost impossible to get into and drive comfortably
2662, a year ago,5,I have been a passenger in this car. It is a beautiful vehicle . Smooth ride. Spacious. Perfect family car. Lovely interior. I would recommend.
2663, a year ago,3,Well at first it drove good have really good a/c system drove it everywhere but it start give problems.
2664, a year ago,2,I had this car for about 6 months brand new and it kept getting messed up I’d take it to the dealer and they would tell me nothing was wrong turns out it was the clutch ?  I think that’s what they said I don’t remember But it still kept messing up after that was fixed Ford Focus is a no go for me.
2665, a year ago,4,"I have been driving my 2015 Ford Focus for about three years now, and the only reason we are upgrading is because we need a larger vehicle! 

I have had very few issues with this car and I would suggest it someone who doesn’t need space for children or very much luggage ! 

Ford will always be one company that we look to when looking for a new car !"
2666, a year ago,3,"I had the Ford Fusion (electric car) and while this car is super comfortable, there is little to no trunk space (being that the car battery is stored in the trunk. However, for people who do not need much trunk space this is a great car. It is an extremely quiet car with seat warmers and while driving it, you can not even tell the car is on."
2667, a year ago,3,"Small, sporty appearance. Hatchback had a lot of room for groceries or whatever else you need to transport. Did not get around in the snow, transmission issues-clutch had to be replaced 3 or 4 times in 3 years"
2668, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my Ford Escape! I drive it all the time and spend a decent amount on gas but considering I have four-wheel drive too, it’s really a wonderful car! Very much recommend! I do wish it had more leg room in the back for people but it does the job!"
2669, a year ago,4,"Love this price for this car and the amount of gas it saves! My husband has had this car for a while and it’s almost at 90,000 miles and is still going like a champion! I would definitely recommend this for someone who wants fuel saving!"
2670, a year ago,4,"Nice little car! It is compact and easy to drive. Because it is so small, it doesn’t have a lot of weight to it and can struggle in ice and snow."
2671, a year ago,5,I had it as a rental while having my car worked on . I loved how it handled turns. It’s a regular car you can drive every day and not get tired of.
2672,a year ago,4,My Fiesta is now 9 years old and has 180.000 kilometers. The car gets used every day for work and during holidays for travel. We love this car and hope we can drive it for a few more years.
2673, a year ago,5,"I love my little Ford Focus. Perfect for me, it’s a little tight when I try to fit people but other than that it’s perfect. My boyfriend is 6 ft and being in the front is a little snug for him, I still can’t complain about my focus. I’ve had it for 3 years and runs awesome, also too space in the trunk once you put the seats down. Really fits a lot of stuff"
2674, a year ago,5,My mom just got the new 2020 escape and it is amazing! I love all of the features with the new models
2675, a year ago,5,I loved this car! One of the only reasons I got a new car is I wanted 4 wheel drive.
2676, a year ago,5,Everyone in my family ya owned a Ford Escape at some point except me. It is a nice sized car and runs very well. Limited maintenance needed and the newer models are filled with extras. Can’t talk to price too much.
2677, a year ago,4,"Has a lot of zip to it. Great family car! Haven’t had many issues except for the rims that came with it are awful and I lose air in tires constantly. The leather seats have already started cracking, although I’m sure that’s my fault for lack of maintenance."
2678,a year ago,5,"I really like that color, it a really good car for adolescent, I don’t if i am a pros or a cons 😅"
2679,a year ago,5,"The fusion is a very reliable, comfortable car.  I have had one for 10 years and it's never let me down.  With regular maintenance and care it will be a great vehicle for anyone."
2680, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape. I have a 2012 model so it’s the older looking style and I honestly like it more than the new one. It’s still in great condition, and I plan to drive it until it dies on me, OR if I can save up for a new car before that. I’ll probably get another Ford Escape."
2681, a year ago,5,Super good I don’t have one of my own but one of my family members have one and it’s really good it’s super smooth and the car has a good speaker and great gas mileage and the car is just overall super easy to use/ be in it’s really really comfortable and realaxing
2682, a year ago,5,Love this car! I always wanted an suv. Great gas mileage in a car with lots of seating and storage space.
2683, a year ago,4,I think this is a pretty good car. It drives very smooth and has a nice interior. Bluetooth connectivity is great to listen to own music!
2684, a year ago,4,Very nice car. I have the 2011. I’m love with the large sunroof and really enjoy the Bluetooth connectivity. Overall love the interior!
2685,a year ago,5,My sister owns a Ford Escape and I love stealing it from her to take it for a spin. It is so comfortable to drive. It has great milage too. The Bluetooth features and just amazing. When I buy a new car in the future I will definitely be looking at an escape.
2686, a year ago,4,Really like the  Ford Focus.  The seating is comfortable and the room is great.  The ride seemed quite smooth.  Some vehicles have a really tight feeling to the power steering but I found this quit easy to steer without much effort.  I would recommend a Ford Focus.
2687,a year ago,5,Great value and reliable. Unbelievable gas mileage and pickup. No complaints from a happy owner. Maybe tough to get in and out of if you’re tall.
2688,a year ago,5,Best value SUV on the market. Reliable & the fit and finish are much better than Chevy. I was a Chevy guy for years but...
2689, a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my 2019 Fusion Energi. I originally owned a preowned 2011 regular Fusion, but when I started commuting in California, I looked into a new car that would allow me into the HOV lane. Because I loved my Fusion so much, I immediately looked to Ford and found my current car! Safe, reliable, comfortable, stylish, and filled with great tech, I recommend the Fusion/Fusion Energi to everyone in real life! Everyone I give rides to is totally impressed from the moment they get in 😎"
2690, a year ago,4,Ford is an OK vehicle honestly I would purchase a different brand I’m not very thrilled with ford ￼
2691, a year ago,5,"Awesome car. Crash rate is amazing. Sister in law crashed car and my niece, nephew, and sister in law walked away with just bumps and bruises. Very affordable. "
2692,a year ago,5,"Good car, young and sportive design. Not the first brand that i would Choose. But price and quality it is a really good brand"
2693,a year ago,5,I love this car! It’s the only new car I’ve ever purchased and I’m so glad I did. All the up to date features are wonderful! And the look is classic without being too bulky for me to comfortably drive.
2694, a year ago,5,My favorite vechile . It rides so smoothly. High recommend to people with families.
2695,a year ago,5,"Really nice, good size for a small family. Looks really nice and the inside it really comfy"
2696, a year ago,5,"I love my little red Ford Focus hatchback, I’ve had several different cars through out the years and never liked them as much as my ford!!"
2697, a year ago,4,"We have had our Escape for 7 years. It’s great for traveling, holds all that we take to the beach or to visit family. Great family vehicle."
2698, a year ago,2,The car wasn’t bad but did make me motion sick. Gas mileage was really bad in it. I would definitely have not have bought the car if I knew it would be bad. Very pricey and I do not recommend getting one of this used.
2699, a year ago,5,"It’s a good car like it a lot. Decent gas mileage. Didn’t handle pot holes that well, but I mean what car does. Wasn’t a bad car. Car was a little pricey, but the amount was worth it. I totally recommend."
2700, a year ago,5,"Una marca diseñada para las personas que aman lo bueno , el lujo y además las calidad , imposible quejarse de algo tan hermoso más que enamorada  Ford Escape"
2701, a year ago,5,I love a nice focus! But in my opinion they are a little crammed on the inside. But they are a nice starter car in my opinion.
2702, a year ago,5,I love my fusion! It has everything I need in it! Gets pretty good gas mileage! The inside is actually pretty spacious which I love because I hate a crammed car.
2703, a year ago,2,Do your research and make sure you are buying a reliable car! Check for problems that occur frequently with that type and year. I rode with my friend 3 hours from home and her car was making all sorts of noises and doing the “huck-a-buck” despite being less than 6 months old. Come to find out the transmission had a recall.
2704, a year ago,5,"completely spacious! great on mileage and not to bad on fuel costs, i think this car is great for anyone weather your a couple, family, elderly anything it fits all people and i think that’s great, they have a good outside as well as inside look to them with funky inside gadgets"
2705, a year ago,4,pretty spacious car not to uncomfortable can’t say much about them as i’m not into cars or even drive but whenever i have been in one they have always had good intentions and good gadgets inside never heard a complaint about them
2706, a year ago,4,I love this car but I have the 2013 and had a lot of problems with it! It is a very nice car though! I would definitely recommend it to someone who needs a small SUV with 4WD.
2707, a year ago,5,I like it when I travel because have a lot space and I can take a lot stuffs and I don’t need to worried
2708, a year ago,5,"I love my 2018 Ford Escape. It has been the best purchase that I’ve made. I did have issues with the breaks, by my dealership worked with me."
2709, a year ago,3,"Nice spacious car big boot. Comfy!  Ideal for families. Drives well, plenty of leg room and speaker system is good. Seems affordable"
2710, a year ago,4,"Great car, looks nice on the inside and the outside. Def a WIDE car, took a while getting used to after driving a Mitsubishi Eclipse for a while! One down side is the major blind spot it has with the wide front windshield frame"
2711, a year ago,5,"Auto muy accesible buen precio y calidad, variedad de colores y muy sencillo de manejar"
2712,a year ago,4,El producto es muy útil fácil de usas muy bueno para los niños es super recomendable aunque le faltan ciertas mejoras la verdad podria funcionar bien para un hogar teniendo en cuenta su conectividad y todo lo que atrae con ellas el mio casi no funcionó pero ppr daño de fábrica
2713, a year ago,4,I like this car. It’s great for quick speed. It gets me to where I need to go. And holds quick a bit for storage. The seats go down nicely.
2714, a year ago,5,I love this vehicle. Drive nice. Seats are extremely comfortable. This vehicle is a great dependable suv. It also has plenty of room
2715, a year ago,3,"Good little cars, not a ton of space, but if you don’t need a lot of space they are great commuter cars, good on fuel, good interiors."
2716, a year ago,5,My husband loved this vehicle however he wanted to upgrade. I love how this car sounds and how sporty it looked. I liked how low it sat and the speed.
2717, a year ago,5,"Roomy, is how I’d describe this car. Great mileage, leather interior, plus a sporty design. Sunroof for those nice sunny days. Excellent starter car for any graduate 👩‍🎓."
2718, a year ago,5,"I love my Escape. It is comfortable, efficient and fun to drive. Can’t wait to get my next one!"
2719, a year ago,1,What  an  awful car. Terrible  car  for  the  value. Everything  that  can  go  wrong  absolutely  will.  It’s even uncomfortable
2720, a year ago,5,"I bought my Ford Escape 5 years ago and I love it. I’ve driven it to work for small commutes and then long commutes. I’ve taken it on road trips across the country and camping all over. It’s perfect for me, it’s moved me and friends many times, it totes my nephews perfectly and keeps us all safe. I’ve been hit by inattentive drivers and it’s kept me safe each time. I love that they seats fold down it super helpful and super easy."
2721,a year ago,3,Big car which u can relate when u are a family or something like that but for me alone I don't like.
2722,a year ago,5,I absolutely LOVE my car. It’s great on gas. The seats are very comfortable. Great for road trips! The only thing I would improve is the vents in the car. They are very narrow.
2723, a year ago,3,It’s a decent car. Gets great gas mileage and I didn’t have any known issues out of it when I had one.
2724, a year ago,4,Para mí un excelente auto la transmisión y todo pero tengo un problemita se me calienta despues de un tiempo encendido el ac
2725, a year ago,4,"I love my Escape! It handles like a smaller car, gets great gas mileage, and can haul like a larger and more unwieldy SUV. Every year though, without fail, as soon as I start running the AC a lot, the moisture builds up in the filter and STINKS, so we have to clean it out a few times every summer.  I’ve never had a car with this issue before, so I’m assuming something is funky about how things are put together. But, it’s otherwise a wonderful, reliable car."
2726, a year ago,5,We bought the 2020 escape titanium hybrid and it is a very luxurious car at an affordable price! Very impressed with service and quality. Cool new technology and features and great on gas
2727, a year ago,5,"Bought and owned a ford fusion for over 10 years. Absolutely love the car, tons of room, huge trunk and good handling. Only dislike is it has a tendency to wear the back driver tire weird so I have to make sure tires are rotated regularly."
2728, a year ago,5,I love my Focus it’s so cute and sporty looking it’s not all that great on gas mileage but good enough for me. I can’t give my car enough stars or praise. It gets me where I want to go and I love changing lights on the inside.
2729, a year ago,3,Super fast car with good mileage. On the smaller side so there isn’t much protection. Wish it was bigger.
2730, a year ago,5,I used to own a Ford Focus. It was really great. Good gas mileage and passenger room.
2731, a year ago,5,Drove nice for a small car. Not a small car person but I’d recommend it for anyone who isn’t picky.
2732, a year ago,4,Très bonne voiture rien à dire fonctionne très bien ce n’est ps moi qui conduit personnellement mais ma famille et amis
2733, a year ago,5,I love my Ford Escape. It’s the perfect size crossover. I can fold the back seat down flat to extend the trunk space (large enough for an 6-7 foot bookcase box and other things) but don’t ever feel like I’m driving something too big.
2734, a year ago,4,It was a great starter car. It accelerated nicely and was the perfect compact car that wasn’t too small.
2735, a year ago,4,Solid vehicle. Have had mine for years!! It’s a 2007 and I haven’t had any real issues.
2736, a year ago,4,Very efficient. Very good gas mileage. Strong car. I think that this car should be promoted more often I just think people don’t buy it too much right now due to the virus.
2737, a year ago,4,I like this car very efficient but the seats are not comfortable for a 7 hour drive. Very uncomfortable.
2738, a year ago,3,"The features look cheap on the interior and the gas was less than desirable. I had it as a rental, and it wasn’t horrible, but I would never purchase it."
2739,a year ago,3,Non affordable   Not what I expected.  Not a smooth drive   Would prefer something smaller
2740, a year ago,4,My mother owns a Ford Focus. As a passenger it rides well and fits 5 people comfortably.
2741, a year ago,5,"Myself and a few colleagues drove one of these all the way from Leeds to Le Mans. It never missed a beat the whole way there (and back). It was a great spec of car, which probably made it easier, but super roomy and comfy. Loved it."
2742, a year ago,4,"I grew up without a family car. I either walked, biked or bussed everywhere I went. When my  husband and I got this car we loved all the amazing features that came with it. The Ford customer service was also really helpful and made the process easy."
2743, a year ago,4,Nice car for a soccer mom or older couple looking to downsize. Has great trunk space. Nice and easy to use. Great on gas mileage.
2744, a year ago,5,"Love Ford. So excited for the new Ford Bronco to come out! Already own a 1984 Bronco, 2004 F250, 2012 F350 and several explorers. Their motors are great and dependable as long as you maintain upkeep and do usual maintenance when you are supposed to."
2745, a year ago,5,Very good and comfortabke car with awesome buildup. Suitable for small family. Very smooth racing and easy to manage
2746, a year ago,3,"Not a bad car. But difficult upkeep wise. The moment anything goes wrong,  everything else around it will go wrong. Car falls apart easily by way of cosmetics. But the motor is sound"
2747, a year ago,4,I love this car. So comfortable and easy going . Its racing speed is very good as well as its build . It has comfortable seats. Use less petrol and has amazing functions.
2748, a year ago,3,Nice car with leg room. I like the looks of the car. It’s a car so no room to haul things. Not sure what or how to improve.
2749, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Fusion! It has plenty of space in the backseat for my child, as well as plenty of storage space. The trunk is also extra large to the point I could probably fit a bike inside of it. Ford has many options available for the Fusion with many exciting upgrades such as leather and heated seats which are a must in Michigan's cold winters."
2750, a year ago,4,Not my first choice car but it’s very reliable and gets me to where I need to be. I’ve had minimal problems with it.
2751,a year ago,4,"My Ford Escape is a 2014 model. It drives smoothly, and looks great. It has lots of room for all my stuff and doesn’t make you feel cramped. I have had issues with the technology/music portion of the interior but Ford fixed it eventually."
2752,a year ago,3,Such a lovely car. We got to try it out when my bf's car was in the shop and this was the rental they gave him. Such a great and smooth ride. The features are great! However I don't trust the longevity of the car when it reaches 100kmi
2753, a year ago,4,Great space in this car! I’ve been able to move most things to new houses in this car. Recommend for those that are looking for more space!
2754, a year ago,3,I wasn’t a big fan of this car. I drove mine for about a year and the engine blew up. The car itsself was at 75k miles when that happened and was only 3 years old. It definitely wasn’t my favorite car.
2755, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Fiesta. I’ve never had any problems with it in the time I’ve had it, that bring nearly 5 years!"
2756,a year ago,4,"I’m not a big fan of fords, however this is a decent car. The inside is very nice, sad there’s no cd player in the newer models tho"
2757, a year ago,4,Dependable and very up to date. It has a modern feel but it doesn’t necessarily look like it’s breaking the bank. It is a nice car for someone who doesn’t need much space. I personally like bigger cars hence the lack of the last star.
2758,a year ago,2,It's a very good car and and very spacious so so there is is a lot of room 4 or anything if you have have a big family this car is very good for you
2759, a year ago,5,"I love this car, it is my favorite and when I get my next car it will most likely be the same. Of course my model is a 2014 so it is not as up to date as I would like. I would love if Ford would give you updates like CarPlay."
2760, a year ago,3,"I had my Ford Focus for years, however, it constantly had issues with the battery and engine"
2761, a year ago,5,"Love it, black on black, cute sporty and quick. Great on gas also especially nowadays lol"
2762, a year ago,4,This is also a great car for new/young drivers. I would also say that it drives very smoothly and could be good option too for elderly.
2763, a year ago,4,Easy to drive and looks stylish. I would also recommend it to any new/young drivers. 🚙
2764, a year ago,1,"I loved my 2003 Ford Escape, it was such a great car, really reliable and comfortable. When it got totaled in 2017, I started looking at new cars and tried a new Ford Escape. The quality has really gone downhill. It felt cheap and the seats were very uncomfortable."
2765, a year ago,3,I’ve only been a passenger in th is vehicle and I just dislike the backseat for car seats. It’s probably the leather seats. I know the owner has had multiple problems going wrong with her model. I probably wouldn’t purchase one.
2766, a year ago,5,You can always trust ford for a good quality vehicle for a fair price. Good array of features to add.
2767, a year ago,1,Worst car we have ever owned. The transmission sucks. The mykey sucks. Ford charged us like crazy for their own known transmission issue.
2768, a year ago,5,"Muy grande, el color está muy lindo, esta muy barato para ser de su forma, sus ventajas es que sa puede de paseo todos juntos de una familia mediana o pequeña y van a estar muy comodos.
Está muy bueno para el precio que tiene.
Lo recomiendo porque es muy grande y el color muy bonito."
2769,a year ago,4,Ford Fiesta Ecoboost 1 litres are very nippy. Cheap to run and no tax to pay! Poke thing I would say is that (probably like most cars) they start needing expensive repost’s after about 4 years. Space inside is not as big as I would hope either.
2770,a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Fiesta so much. It is so great on gas mileage and is totally reliable. I have the hatch back, which gives me all the extra space I need. This car is very affordable, and I don’t regret this purchase at all. Highly recommend!"
2771, a year ago,4,"I went out & test drive this car. I can't afford a new car, but a mom has dreams. I loved it.  It handled great. Just enough room for me. I kinda wish I hadn't driven it. Now I want it. Over all, a great car. I liked the feel of the stering wheel. Good-looking vehicle."
2772,a year ago,5,Que hermoso me encanta me encanta me gustaria mucho algun dia tener el placer de tenerlo 🤭🤭🤭 y gracias a dios yo se que podre
2773, a year ago,4,I do enjoy the features of this vehicle. Overall nice features. I touch on the luxury side. Does have nice get up and go. Give me fuel mileage. Very eco-friendly. My safety measures. Somewhat overpriced. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
2774, a year ago,5,"My man says “ when I die, they’ll find FORD emblems on my organs!“ It’s in my blood.  I love my 4x4 Ford truck! Like my father and his before him. There’s nothing I can’t haul and no fishing hole I can’t get to. #foreverford Ford Motor Company "
2775, a year ago,4,My dad use to own one of these and we loved it! It didn’t ride super smooth but he had like a 2010 so I’m sure the new ones are probably smoother
2776, a year ago,5,Mom used to drive this car until she crashed in it but it lasted it long time it used to take me to work for more than 5 years and she used to keep it intact all the time she used to pay affordably for it i guess its because she's been driving since she was younger than when I started.
2777, a year ago,5,"I like it a family member had it. It has enough space, runs great  seats are confortable. Cold air. The front part started to peel soon from wear and tear but Its nice for a family. It's an expensive car but good and easy on gas. I do recommend it for everyday"
2778, a year ago,5,Love fords ! The focus is a cute compact car ... little and good on gas and affordable price wise ! Maybe make the focus into a all wheel drive!! Something for the snow defiantly recommend! Love the blue on the focus!
2779, a year ago,4,I had a 2014 fusion. I really liked this car. It was great on fuel and very comfortable to drive. However I had lots of issues with this one so it spent a lot of time in the shop. I decided to trade it in.
2780, a year ago,5,I've had a few Ford's over the years. I find the vehicles to be reliable and comfortable. Tag he options are great.
2781, a year ago,4,"Was a nice car to drive. Soft steering, nice contact with the road.No weird driving noises. Easy to use dashboard and electronics."
2782, a year ago,4,"My Escape has been the best decision I’ve ever made! It’s the perfect size for me and my dog, especially with all of my camping gear packed inside it! The only thing I have been disappointed with is the recalls on the doors and the windshield wipers. After the recall was fixed, my doors dont close properly and the motor on my windshield wipers are synced so they often hit each other and get stuck."
2783, a year ago,4,My 2016 Fusion SE is fun to drive and has great gas mileage. Im looking to upgrade to the sport model in the near future. The SYNC system can be a bit troublesome at times. When playing media from a blue tooth device the volume can increase to max. The car does have pillars on either side of the windshield that could hide a compact vehicle.
2784, a year ago,3,Spacious. Somewhat affordable. Keeps up with most technology and trim lines are enough to satisfy everyone. Gas mileage seems to be okay but ford reliability isn’t all the greatest and it seems like finance terms are ok.
2785, a year ago,3,"Mediocre base model. Higher end performance models are okay. Focus used to be a better known car and it’s isn’t any longer. Fairly affordable, fairly reliable as much as a ford can be. Overall okay. Wouldn’t buy."
2786, a year ago,3,"Mediocre car. Ford quality not great, but fairly inexpensive. Higher end models are okay but they’re all former rentals, not many on the road purchased brand new from ford directly. Overall okay to drive."
2787, a year ago,5,"Our Family has been driving Ford Vehicles for 10+ years and I must say they are the most reliable vehicle we have ever owned.
Whenever we work with the people at our local dealer they are super helpful and polite. They go above and beyond for their customer"
2788, a year ago,5,I absolutely loved our Escape. It was our family vehicle for 3 years till we upgraded to the Edge for our Growing kiddos. One of the most reliable vehicles I have ever owned.
2789, a year ago,5,Excelente vehículo me encanta la comodidad de el auto además de que tiene un excelente motor y es económico para comparación de otros la comodidad de los interiores y los acabados son únicos
2790, a year ago,5,"C'est la première voiture que j'ai conduite et je dois dire que j'en garde de très bons souvenir. Je trouve qu'elle convient très bien pour les petits trajets. Elle est également maniable, agile et facile à garer. Je ne peux que recommander cette voiture."
2791, a year ago,3,Newer models are a tad bit smaller than the older ones. The trunk space isn’t as big as the older ones either.
2792, a year ago,2,Was not very comfortable seating and not much leg room. The ride was bumpy with a lot of outside noise. I personally would not consider owning one.
2793, a year ago,3,"My sister-in-law owns a Ford Fusion. It drives nice and has a massive trunk! The front seat is comfortable but there isn’t much room in the back seat. I own a SUV so I like the room in the back! You can seat a care seat in the back comfortably, if it’s forward facing you should take your child’s shoes off 🙃"
2794, a year ago,4,This car was a rental for me. It’s a bit smaller feeling inside imo but overall was a smooth ride. Would recommend if you’re looking for something compact with an ease of maneuvering + is quite quiet as well.
2795, a year ago,5,"I love my Ford Edge! I didnt want to be a minivan mom once I became a parent, so I bought an SUV instead. It's roomy enough for my needs, drives well and gets decent gas mileage."
2796, a year ago,5,Love that it has a lot of space and is good on gas. I have a long commute so I tend to put a lot of miles on my car and wear and tea and even with that it’s been super reliable.
2797,a year ago,5,hello people I come to tell you that this car is the best thing in life this time I was a passenger but it is very good I recommend it it is the best thing in the world if they don't buy it they will repeat I swear buy it is highly recommended good price everything
2798,a year ago,5,Este auto es un clásico muy bueno para manejar y llevarte donde quieras lo malo es que tienes que cuidarlo mucho y lo bueno es que te saca de muchos apuros lo recomiendo creo que tiene buen precio y calidad🥰
2799,a year ago,5,"Cómodo, rápido en velocidad, fue una buena compra y un gran auto. El que teníamos era de color grafito así que no se le notaba tanto la suciedad como en los autos blancos"
2800, a year ago,4,"Un muy buen auto potencia y elegancia, muy buen motor, el equipo es cómodo, seguro y confiable, tiene buen soporte y excelentes amortiguadores ideal para el trabajo diario a la oficina, muy agradable y confortable, excelente al conducir,"
2801, a year ago,2,La verdad no he usado este producto pero se ve bonito de envoltura. Me gustaría poder hablar desde la experiencia
2802, a year ago,5,I wanna make this car into a custom car. theses cars are so beautiful and nice in my opinion
2803, a year ago,3,While the Focus was spacious as far as seating and storage it had some major recalls that led to scary moments while driving! The backseat door latches broke while driving down the highway! The transmission had countless issues that led to multiple trips to the dealership.
2804,a year ago,4,Great sporty car with some get up and go. I had the 2.0L Ecoboost and there wasn't much it couldn't get out of the way of. Comfortable for long drives and had a great fuel range and MPG rating
2805, a year ago,5,I really enjoy this company. The people there were extremely helpful. They have an amazing selection of vehicles and have financing which was amazing. If You're looking for a vehicle I would recommend to go here. Some places are pretty up there though.
2806, a year ago,5,I love this car it drives so smooth and has great suspension. The gas mileage is amazing. I realky enjoy driving this vehicle.
2807, a year ago,5,"Ford para mi es la mejor marca en carros, adoro mi carro, tiene un despegue inigualable, es más cómodo que cualquier otro carro y su corte es espectacular, yo adoro mi carro 🥰😍"
2808, a year ago,3,"I have not driven the car listed but I've driven a Ford Taurus a 2006 to be exact. I couldn't find it in the search thing that's why I went about it this way. That is the car I own right now. I have driven it more than a few times and ridden in it. It's not very spacious in the back seat area but it is in the front seats. It's not loud and we've never had problems with it.

**I cut the picture off for license plate reasons*"
2809, a year ago,5,"I love cars with a novel design that are designed with family in mind, safety and comfort, it's an amazing car I wish I could handle it soon"
2810, a year ago,5,I quite enjoy this car. It is a compact SUV which means it is easy to drive and park but has a good amount of storage space inside. The seats fold down but not I to the car. It gets about 26 mph on gas and I have had no problems with it in the 5 years I’ve owned it. Reliable and smooth driving with a sleek look.
2811, a year ago,3,"They're cute and comfortable cars. They seem to be getting smaller EVERY year though, which makes it a glorified hatchback."
2812, a year ago,5,we have a used ford focus because we did not want monthly payments we were able to find one for a few thousand dollars it is older but it a nice fun sporty car that fits our budget. I get asked by my friends how come I am not in debt and I never buy anything with monthly payments required while except our apartment rental but that could be for another review at a later date.
2813, a year ago,5,Love my car! Spacious enough for a family of four but not to big to where you feel like you cant park anywhere. Lol
2814, a year ago,3,"Bought a used '07, higher miles, around 130,000, very small town one owner, super clean, as a daily work car for my husband. After about 5- 6 months transmission started going out, had to get rid of it before it left him stranded. I wasn't impressed with them, no bells or whistles, not a lot of power it seemed to be, possibly good sedan for an older aged daily driver, but won't be purchasing another anytime soon around here."
2815, a year ago,3,"We had a 2008 escape, as my everyday driver until we upgraded to a 09 Tahoe and it then became my husband's everyday work vehicle, nothing special about them, actually alot of rust, enough to actually rust out the entire rear wheel fender, which come to find out is a recall in alot of them... Eventually blew up last winter, threw a rod completely thru the block. Won't buy one again."
2816, a year ago,5,J’adore mon véhicule. Petit mais solide. Confortable autant à l’avant qu’à l’arrière et économique sur l’essence
2817,a year ago,5,"Drove this as a rental, a few years ago. Smooth handling and good acceleration for an SUV. Space fora weekend outing, and plenty big enough for me for a week."
2818, a year ago,3,It was a good size vehicle large trunk for shopping.  But the worst part was that the doors malfunctioned all the time and we had kids in the car several times. If this issues resolved then yes I would recommend
2819, a year ago,2,"First off, the car is a 2003, but it's a pile of junk. Nothing in the car works. The AC is busted, it always makes funny noises and a lot of the time it's in the shop. It was super cheap and does get us where we need to go around town though, so I can't complain too much."
2820, a year ago,4,I love this brand car as its affordable and reliable. Parts come cheap for it. Smooth drive  wish I had a newer model and I'm sure the improvements would be better
2821, a year ago,1,"Ford kills it with their trucks, but they’re definitely lacking in this one. If you compare this to a Chevy Equinox, it can’t compete. From design, to price, to overall quality, the Escape just comes up short."
2822,a year ago,2,"I bought my vehicle used, after much research I finally found the exact car I wanted. But now a few years later, I’m realizing things have been neglected. As well, the are some manufacturing flaws. My model has a cap-less gas tank. Which means that it has caused a leak in the fuel system. My regular mechanic can’t figure it out. Now I’m finding out it’s common. I’m considering buying a new vehicle. #fordescape"
2823, a year ago,5,Love this car! Originally owned a focus first but i needed more room and this was just perfect. Picks up in speed very quick
2824, a year ago,1,"I don't drive so I really don't know,but I am going to be taking my driving test again and this is the car that I am looking to purchase."
2825,a year ago,4,"When I was first looking for a small SUV i thought the Ford Escape would  be the best fit. It's not horrible don't get me wrong, it's been very reliable and has always gotten me from point A to B. The biggest problem I have with my escape is; the turbo decides on it own terms when it wants to work and when it doesn't, if feels very light, I hit a deer in 2015 and it nearly totaled my car it almost feels like plastic. Besides, those things it's been a pretty great car!"
2826, a year ago,4,"Una buena marca de autos, sus repuestos son económicos, cómodas, espaciosas, buenos diseños, buenos materiales"
2827, a year ago,5,"Okay so I feel FORD gets a bad rep, BUT I have owned a Ford for over 5 years now... Ford F150 has been my truck for sometime now and I will say I LOVE IT. Their cars may not be the best, but if you're looking for a truck... GO FOR IT!"
2828, a year ago,5,"I love my small red hatchback. Now that the kids have moved out I no longer needed a large vehicle. I purchased this model with flex fuel, because here in California gas is expensive. The economy on gas mileage added with flex fuel option has made this a joy to own."
2829, a year ago,5,Awesome car with All great facility I have loved it till now whatever car had been launched it's superb .if u want to try driving the best car ever I had experienced is Ford fiesta.
2830,a year ago,4,Experiencia única muy confortable exelente auto súper rápido confortable ahorrador lo volvería a montar
2831,a year ago,5,I have the Ford Edge and I absolutely love it. Working with the Ford dealership and Ford financing was also easy. The financial advisor in particular was super helpful in advising me on how to direct extra money toward my loan to more quickly pay off my car.
2832, a year ago,5,"my mom owns this car and i love it 
 the amount of space is tremendous and it’s nice and spacious , no way to improve it, it is affordable if you pay you’re bills , i would recommend this car to others"
2833, a year ago,3,"Unfortunately I had a lot of problems with the 2013 Ford Focus. My spouse owned this vehicle and it was terrible. Had alot of mechanical problems and no power for long highway driving. The interior part were very cheap, broke easily"
2834, a year ago,5,"I rented a brand new 2020 Ford Fusion for a week and it was amazing. All power options and plenty of space in the back seat and trunk. It was definitely fuel efficient, I drove all around for a week and only had to fill up once. It was a really nice car"
2835, a year ago,5,"My husband is the driver he loves our ford fusion. Purchaced and older model for cash paid in full bonus zero car payments. Got the car used for about 4,000. If you are looking for a safe reliable car the ford fusion is awesome. I would recommend the ford fusion to my friends."
2836,a year ago,5,"Love this car! Drives well, great MPG, spacious, awesome tech features and dependable engine. Some issues with connecting my Bluetooth when on the phone, so beware of that"
2837, a year ago,5,"It was a rental car, . I haven’t had no problem. I am averaging about 34.2 mpg so that’s good . I just have the base s model with automatic transmission. Very economical with a decent look. Drives really good . I have no complaints so far .   Quiet, smooth driving.  I love the handling.  Almost sport's car like.  "
2838, a year ago,5,We rented this when we were in Colorado super good on gas very roomy . I just like SUV’s better than cars ￼
2839, a year ago,5,"I LOVE my car! This is the first car I have ever gotten and it has exceeded my expectations. I have had no problems with it since I got it two years ago. It seems very sturdy and well made, unlike some of the other cars I test drove. For anyone who wants a car I would 100% tell them to get a Ford Focus!"
2840, a year ago,5,Excelente producto me encanta la variedad que tiene es una marca que ofrece demasiado lo mejor de lo mejor 100% recomendable
2841, a year ago,4,"Me gusta el Ford focus sin cola, lo siento mucho más cómodo al momento de estacionar. Asientos cómodos, motor de 10"
2842, a year ago,3,"They have came a long way from where they started. The technology is really up to date in these and get great MPG. I’m not really a fan. To me they are ugly, but affordable"
2843, a year ago,4,"I used to travel a lot for work, which required lots of car rentals.  The Focus hatchback was my favourite car, until I found the Impreza. The Focus has a nice sporty look, especially with the Titanium package. Drove nicely and handled well. A solid choice."
2844, a year ago,4,"Spacious, not super low to the ground, drives fairly well. Repairs are decent amount, not overly pricey. Comes with great packages with a variety of options. Its an affordable car with low enough monthly payments."
2845,a year ago,1,This car is not worth the metal it comes in. It has been nothing but a headache since we bought this car. It is always falling apart and in the mechanic shop. Don't waste your time with this brand in general really. 
2846, a year ago,5,I love the smooth ride of the fusion. It’s a nice looking car. I did a test drive only.
2847, a year ago,4,"Fiesta is a great and family friendly car. It's smalk but at the same time pretty spacious. 
The car itself is great and i don't think it has any cons.
The price of the car is reasonable and affordable.
I would recommend this car to everyone who is looking for a small but spacious, family friendly or daily driver."
2848, a year ago,4,I love Ford trucks. We have owned a couple Ford f250s and they are durable and if taken care of you can easily get 300k miles plus. Might be looking into a ford f150 next
2849, a year ago,5,I had a yellow 2004 for escape or maybe it was as a2001 but still a great car even ran over a tree that was across the road car didn’t fall apart
2850, a year ago,3,I’m not a big fan of fords but the inside of the new fusions are nice and it speeds !
2851, a year ago,3,"Ford escapes are really something that you know exactly what you’re paying for.

I would pay to have all of the upgrades in the package so that you have the best possible family friendly ride and get the best possible performance out of your escape."
2852, a year ago,5,"Ford fusions are amazing on gas they have all of the amazing technology and upgrades you can think possible.

Family friendly easy on maintenance great on gas reliable everything you want in a beautiful family friendly car.

I happen to have the Ford fusion titanium which means I own all of the upgrades and they were 100% worth the extra investment in that we have a more comfortable beautiful ride￼Top of the line performance.

I love the sleek design and functionality of this particular model a Ford and highly recommend it."
2853, a year ago,5,I absolutely love my little truck! I was in the market for a new vehicle and I'm glad I settled on the 2017 Ford Escape. It's the perfect midsize SUV and with so many different variations of this model you could definitely find everything you need in this vehicle.
2854, a year ago,4,Very comfortable. New cool features. Very decent price. For friends and family. Fast and smooth ride!
2855, a year ago,5,its my friends car. like to drive. so comfortable and speedy car.. love it so much ..
2856, a year ago,3,"eh it’s a decent car. did the job. absolutely trashed itself after 100,000 miles. even with routine maintenance"
2857, a year ago,4,Very spacious. It’s has great gas mileage. I love my suv. It’s great for an expanding family.
2858, a year ago,4,"This car does absolutely everything it promises to do and feel comfortable while doing it. However, I do often feel like I am driving a spaceship and there a few blind spots due to my height (about 5'4) and the way the car is built. It has a 4 star safety rating with only one issue by the front air bag, an issue that is common with SUV's like this car. The tech features are nice but the touch screen is hard to navigate due to the way the cover sticks out on top. This car is worth the money you spend as it has a really fair price."
2859,a year ago,5,Always had Fords besides the one time I regretted getting A Dodge Ram truck...started with a Maverick to 3 Mustangsa...a explorer and bout 5 pick up trucks
2860, a year ago,5,"muy cómodos los asientos y también amplios. Mantiene muy bien la temperatura dentro del auto ya sea frío o calor, además los vidrios polarizados ayudan mucho.El motor no suena casi nada y en general es perfecto. Auto ideal para viajes largos."
2861, a year ago,4,It’s roomy and has a smooth ride. It surprisingly has a lot of storage. It has a good pick up with its turbo engine.
2862, a year ago,4,"This is a good car, it’s an older car but a good one it runs good and has been working well for a while now"
2863, a year ago,2,"When I was purchasing a vehicle it was between the Ford Escape or the Hyundai Santa Fe and well I choose the Santa Fe. I did not like the feel of the Escape, it felt very boxy and not comfortable, also I found it did not drive the smoothest, I could not find a comfortable position to drive in. I would not recommend this car to anyone.  Ford Motor Company "
2864, a year ago,4,Nice car nice interior definitely if you can customize it go for it. Good amount of space for four people and you can fit five.￼
2865, a year ago,4,I  buy this car for going to forest . I like to go forest for travelling in there. It is good to drive weather it on mountain. It good ideal for the best car after range rover.. it is fuel happy . Nice to go and alot of fun.. try it and fell it the good way
2866, a year ago,5,"El ford fiesta es un super auto para ser el mas economico del catalogo de ford, es super seguro, nada tragon o sea que es economico, quizas abria que mejorar la calidad de los asientos pero despues en cuanto a tecnologia tiene todo lo que uno puede querer"
2867, a year ago,2,These cars are too small for my taste. They also seem to be very cheaply made. It kinda reminds me of a plastic toy car. They don't seem to have very much power when it comes to get up and go. These have to be affordable for the quality you get but it is not for me!
2868, a year ago,5,My bf owns a fushion. Great city driver and highway driver. Comfy. I always say its like driving a cloud.
2869, a year ago,4,Great car. Good city driver ..it's Peppy but the recalls and the main recall which is a shutter is my only concern.

2873, a year ago,4,"I think this is one of the most beautiful cards Ford has created (in this line), specially the hatchback version. I only think they should work more on how the board and the buttons look."
2874, a year ago,5,I love my 2016 Ford Fusion SE with ecoboost!  Never had an issue with it at all!  This car was bought used in 2017 and now has 61k miles on it.  This is my 2and Fusion because we liked our 1st one so much.
2875,a year ago,5,"This was my first vehicle ever. Definitely a good safety conscious start, with tons of special features. The back up camera and sensors make it ideal for a new driver. And helps teach you what to watch out for. Gets amazing gas mileage as well! 31. 2 on average!"
2876, a year ago,4,"Love this car, has enough room for your family. Its good on gas, it drives really well. I was scares of driving something that was bigger than my last car, but i was not dissapointed."
2877, a year ago,5,I like my Ford Focus but my mustang is my absolute favorite! It wasnt an option in my snaps though 🤨 my focus has taken my family & I back & forth on long trips with no issues.
2878, a year ago,5,"This is a beautiful, economically smart car. The interior is beautiful and you can add on features to it like Mx radio and your cell phone service. It’s a good car for the value."
2879, a year ago,4,"The interior of the car is really comfortable, the engine doesn't sound at all and it is Perfecto for a small famaly"
2880, a year ago,5,Es muy buen vehículo RECOMENDADICIMO!! Sus asientos sos n demaciado cómodos y su volante muy suave lo que hace que el viene sea tranquilo y plasentero
2881, a year ago,4,"Miss driving around in my friends Ford Focus. Cute car, great accessibility easy to control and blind spots are good too"
2882,a year ago,5,16th birthday gift for our son. Was a great beginners car and help up amazing. Great on gas and was easy for him to maintain. No need for change in my eyes. Was very affordable and was able to sell it for a good price.
2883,a year ago,3,Drove one as a rental and wasn't a fan. Was just a bit to small but other than that was a good car. It was great on gas I did really like the radio system.
2884,a year ago,5,me encantaria tener este carro el color es muy bonito me encanta esta marca es muy bonita y muy grande esta muy espectacular
2885, a year ago,5,Es muy bonito la pintura esta muy genial la comodidad y el ahorro de gasolina pero lo que mas me gusta es su diseño y la modernidad del tablero y la pantalla

2888, a year ago,4,I  had one of these for a rental car in Hawaii.  Very roomy and comfortable ride.  I would consider purchasing this model.
2889,a year ago,5,"I've only been a passenger of this car and a rental driver of one. However,  I love Chevrolet! I Wish this was my car. It rides very smoothly and is so functional and safe for a large family!!! I definitely would recommend it! 😊"
2890, a year ago,5,Best first car. I bought mine used and its 12 years old and it still runs like its brand new. I definitely got my money's worth.
2891, a year ago,4,I was impressed with the overall design of this crossover.  It drives much smoother than I had anticipated and had all the bells and whistles of its competitors. The interior was comfortable but left me wanting more room like many of Ford’s larger vehicles. Overall it is a solid choice for the price.
2892, a year ago,1,My husband had a 2013 model and it was a complete lemon. He continuously had electrical problems that were “fixed” multiple times at our local Ford dealership. We filed a lemon law complaint and were denied b/c Ford fought us every step of the way. This car was constantly in the shop and was a complete waste of money. I would think twice before buying this model or any other Ford.
2893, a year ago,5,"It is a good vehicle. Very comfortable, spacious, suitable for family adventures, is spacious and represents status"
2894,a year ago,5,Muy buen vehículo ninguna falla me encanta lo recomiendo mucho mucho es realmente bueno con toda la sinceridad es lo mejor
2895, a year ago,5,"Divino este Ford Focus, súper lindo me encanta el modelo ❤, encantador muy encantador , un gusto poder tenerlo , es una maravilla ❤"

2898, a year ago,5,Es buenisimo ese auto es muy economico y de exelente calidad . Su servicio es buenisimo y se los recomiendo exelente el producto
2899, a year ago,4,"Love Ford Mustangs 2015 is my favorite year or the 2010 gold edition.beautiful machinr,fast, great handling and beautiful interior"
2900, a year ago,4,"I like the design, I also like the interior, they have a good saving on fue, the colors it handles are very cute"
2901, a year ago,4,I have a 2012 Ford escape. It’s nice and drives good and has a sunroof. I’ve had this car for so long That sometimes I think it’s time for a new car but I can’t afford it right now
2902,a year ago,4,"En mi casa llevamos 6 años con nuestra camioneta. De verdad, esplendida. Hasta ahora La hemos podido meter en cualquier terreno, no se siente pesado el viaje sino que realmente ligero. Es cómoda. Lo único es que los repuestos son algo costosos."
2903,a year ago,5,"Es una buena marca además de su modelo, la eficiencia de su motor es buena. Las características y el diseño esta genial"
2904,a year ago,5,El carro está genial su color a la velocidad q anda es hermoso quisiera tener uno esta hermosos me encanta
2905, a year ago,4,I had an older version of the foredeck skate but I really loved it a got me everywhere due to go and not only did I get to use it but my friend and her family got to use it as well and would in really have any problems out of it it was really good on gas and it's a great family vehicle
2906, a year ago,5,"My rating for the Ford Fussion is very good, I have very good reviews for Ford, plus it is a super comfortable car, both for family use or personal use.The best thing about these cars is that you do not spend as much gasoline, you save too much because it has few cylinders."
2907, a year ago,5,"My rating for the Ford Fussion is very good, I have very good reviews for Ford, plus it is a super comfortable car, both for family use or personal use."
2908, a year ago,5,"A family van or for personal use ....Perfect and covers all the needs in a car...I want to buy the same. The model is too cute, comfortable and elegant."
2909, a year ago,4,"It's a bit small, but still nice. My mom drives this car, but she always complains of the trunk space. But when we went to ikea, we fit an 8 case book case (in the box) in it no problem....so there's that."
2910, a year ago,5,"Love this car! It's all black with black tinted windows and black interior, not leather but I dont like leather seats in cars anyway, it gets way too hot! It runs good and looks amazing!"
2911, a year ago,2,Does the vehicle run? Yes. But it's been the most annoying vehicle to work on when Does requires unnecessary special tools and equipment to deal with uncomplicated issues (like transmission fluid and gear oil changes). Performance is also not really sufficient on base models compared to what else is available on the market.
2912, a year ago,4,"Definently not something that will save you gas if you have a mustang, Ford products are also very hard to find and very expensive to get. You're constantly working on a Ford. But, the muscle behind the cars are great. If you're looking to travel a lot dont get a muscle car."
2913,a year ago,2,"Originally I loved my 2012 Ford Focus, but then my transmission went out. Ford incorrectly made all 2012 Focus transmissions and of course WE had to pay to get it replaced even though it was Fords fault. The car has also had a few other small issues and I’m not sure how long this new transmission will last. The only good things I can say about this car is that it gets great gas mileage, is small and easy to drive and park, and looks cute."
2914, a year ago,5,I love my car. It works perfectly for me since it has a big trunk where my dog fits perfectly and has lots of space. I never put her in the back seat since she likes to be looking at the cars behind me or resting. My car is really resistant and I've spent some of my best memories on it. It was the perfect choice for me.
2915,a year ago,4,"was my first car, lovely drive and very roomy, sturdy car. only downside is the bodywork doesnt last two seconds"
2916, a year ago,4,"It's a car. It bogs down (badly--like stall in the middle of the road bogs down) when the air conditioner is on and the air conditioner only cools if you're driving on the highway. This is a car for someone who doesn't enjoy driving, lives in the city, and only needs to get from point A to point B safely. I don't hate it and it's definitely reliable, but it's just a car."
2917, a year ago,5,"Nice car. It was my mom's and she loved it despite the air conditioner only working when the car was moving and the AWD still somehow resulting in a 5 mph turn turning into a slide when there was snow on the ground. It was reliable though, and I know she got a good deal on it."
2918, a year ago,4,"Me gusta mucho el color, sin embargo no se si es tan rápido, me encantaría probarlo. Manejarlo y saber que tal es para poder recomendarlo. Alguien. Porfis que me diga como puedo tenerlo. Realmente es un auto hermoso, me encantó entre todos los demás."
2919, a year ago,3,Not to fond of the style of the interior. It’s to “bubbled” out and I found that the Ford Escape has a lot of mechanical issues. Affordable but would not recommend. If you are looking for cheap this is great but if you are looking for quality I suggest looking elsewhere.
2920,a year ago,5,"Sentis q volas , es comodo, practico , ampleo , muy buen auto resistente hermoso diseño . Altas velocidades motor  grande . Hermoso tapizado duradero"
2921, a year ago,5,Excelente producto es genial tener uno o mas de estos autos me encanta su modelo se lo recomiendo es perfecto
2922, a year ago,4,"Have had my 2011 Ford Fusion for 6 years.  Easy to drive, gets around in winter weather and roomy."
2923, a year ago,1,These vehicles are complete trash. I purchased one practically brand new with 50 miles on it. Had so many recalls. My doors actually flew open on day because there was a recall on some clip or screw on the door. My catalytic converter went out the first year but luckily was covered under warranty because it was still new. I had recalls on this thing like every couple of months.. so glad I don’t have this vehicle anymore.. it was terrible.
2924, a year ago,5,"I’ve had my 2009 Ford Focus for 5 years now. It’s super reliable, has never let me sit on the side of the road, and hasn’t required any repairs outside of the regular maintenance. I have had issues with my AC working, but it’s a cheap fix. I recommend this car for anyone looking for a reliable, cheap, American vehicle."
2925, a year ago,5,This was my first car o ever owned. I got it in 2005. I swear it was so cute and perfect. It's great on gas. I never ever had a problem with it. I got rid of it because I needed something bigger when my family got bigger. It is a small car and I liked it a lot!
2926,a year ago,2,They have ok vehicles. Don't really like the trucks. The handling of the vehicle is not that great. I would say this is my 3rd choice
2927, a year ago,3,"Ford car is a very good car I love the cooling system and the functionality of the engine 
It can go miles without breakdown"
2928, a year ago,2,These are really nice and fats and spacious on the inside and really neat.  But I don’t really like small cars.
2929, a year ago,5,Absolutely love this car we own 2 of them! Love the gas mileage the smooth ride of this car too..would recommend this car to anyone.
2930, a year ago,5,Great vehicle overall...have owned for about 6 years and its dependable...price was good for everything that come with it.
2931, a year ago,5,I have had this car since I have started driving and it’s been a really good car although I need a new this car is still kickin it and it’s a really good car and lasts so long
2932, a year ago,4,"Jki liked this car, but I think I remember it being smaller than my Elantra. It did ride pretty smooth"
2933, a year ago,4,"I like the ford fusions, but I still think my Elantra ride is smoother and Less noisy"
2934, a year ago,5,"this is my first car and i absolutely love it ! it’s easy to park and drive, great gas mileage, did have a little issue with the transmission but i took it to ford and it was an easy fix, i got the car for an amazing price. if you’re looking for a small car but lots of space inside this is the car for you !!"
2935, a year ago,5,"Ford es mi marca favorita en automóviles , ese motor es espectacular en un viaje me familiar y a la playa siempre entra la familiar"
2936, a year ago,5,This car is very  comfortable spacious  beautiful his designer  he is  fast  i really like this car  he is excellent
2937, a year ago,5,"This is actually my daughters car. It drives so goodit’s a big beautiful suv. But it’s hard for me to get in ,but once I’m in it drives over bumps so nice. It has a rear back up mirror and heated seats. I would recommend this vehicle to everyone.."
2938, a year ago,5,One of my goals is to get one of these cars. I hope my dream can come true someday. I will start saving so I can afford it.
2939, a year ago,5,No tengo uno pero algun dia me encantaría... espero algun dia poder comprarme al menos uno barato pero me encanta
2940,a year ago,5,"This truck is very confortable. I really love the huge it is.
Its big and safety.
Easy to drive and parking"
2941, a year ago,5,"I used to own this car . It is a good choice specially for families , easy going and very comfortable.Also heavy duty. First time user and considered as an option in future again. Highly recommended!!"
2942,a year ago,2,Not my favorite car to drive. It felt clunky. The only reason I had it was because my car got hit by a reckless driver.
2943, a year ago,5,I have owned 2 of these cars and I absolutely love them. They have plenty of room for my 3 teenage kids to sit in the back seat without sitting on top of each other. They are very affordable and easy to maintain. Yes I would recommend.
2944, a year ago,5,Great family car capable of plenty of tasks. We even use this to tow our boat on occasion. The only thing we would improve would be the stock radio. Extremely afforadable for what you get out of it. We highly recommend
2945,a year ago,3,Our latest F250 although mechanically runs well has completely rusted out in the bed like every other F250 you see. We can't even find a replacement bed because they are all rusted. Very disappointed. We have had Ford trucks for years but may be opting to try Toyota instead next time. 
2946, a year ago,4,the car is great! I don't have any problems with it it runs it gets you from point A to point B overall there's no problems whatsoever.
2947,a year ago,4,I love my 2015 ford fiesta. It gets great gas milage and is fun to drive. Only reason I do not give 5 stars as parts are coming off it inside
2948,a year ago,5,We rented this car when we were traveling and we were pretty amazed at how comfy this car was and how easy it was to drive it. Basic car but perfect for a minimalist
2949,a year ago,5,Definitely a great family car and for the more sporty look. They are comfortable and they are price effective too.
2950, a year ago,3,I really like the focus its a nice family car the gear change is lovely i love e heated front and rear windows to.  I just think there a bit over priced when you look around at other brands that are a year or two old and what you get compares to the price of a brand new mod range ford

2956,a year ago,4,Good car for@anyone looking for a midsize family car.  Engine is to slow in the one I had.  I’m would offer better engine choices. But ii is an affordable car and good on gas.  I would get one if in the car market.
2957, a year ago,5,This car is easy to handle with alot of engine power. The leather interior is high quality and looks luxurious. The eco boost makes the car great on gas so i dont fill up much. The sound system sounds good inside and out of the car. Its fairly affordable and an overall great buy.

2966,a year ago,4,"You can use them to travel with your whole family or for work purposes. Well, it has a very comfortable space to store luggage and your passengers will always be comfortable and safe. It is an excellent option for everyone because for people like me, who do not have children but enjoy traveling with their dogs, it is the best option."
2967, a year ago,3,"The car feels very low to the ground and cramped in the passenger compartment. The trunk space is decent for the size of the car, I suppose. Even for a sedan, there isn't a lot of leg room. It is somewhat concerning that the gas cap is simply a pull system with no fastener of any kind nor any actual cap when refueling. On or the other would be fine but the system is so simple anyone could get access without so much as a noise while you are sitting at a stop light. The pickup in the vehicle is slow especially as the car ages."
2968, a year ago,5,Great first car as its simple but a lovely car. Cheap to run but good quality of a product. Have recommended these to family members. Smooth to drive and have improved with every new version they have brought out. Well done Ford
2969, a year ago,5,I thought that this was a great car to be a passenger in! It was very comfortable and there was plenty of room in the backseat as well.

2970, a year ago,5,"I think it’s an overall really good car. The look and shape of the car is very sleek and stylish and they run very well. They’re not too expensive, very good price for how well they do. The mpg is very good on the car. I would recommend!"

2979, a year ago,5,"I have had my Ford Fusion for seven years now, and it is so great. I really love the features, though I'm sure they've been updated in seven years. It's a good size of car, and it has gotten me everywhere I need to go. It gets decent gas mileage, and it's a good poking vehicle!"

This car is expensive and not addorable for middle class families.This car spare parts not available easily in service center. The car do not have good milage.

2985, a year ago,5,"I have a 2009 Ford escape and I absolutely love it! I’m over 100,000 miles and it keeps going. Only a couple repairs nothing that major.  I do keep up the maintenance checks I think that does have a lot to do with it keep the oil changed tires rotated all that kind of stuff. One of my favorite cars!"
2986,a year ago,3,Not very spacious so good if you don't have kids. Very good on gas - I average 32 miles per gallon.
2987, a year ago,4,"It's a good little fuel efficient car. Suits my needs as a daily driver. A few minor issues with my years model which Ford has been trying to find solutions for. Other than that, I've been satisfied."

2993, a year ago,2,I have a 2013. I have owned it for 4 months. The transmission slips. A sway rod has broke. It’s got so many recalls. The older were so good. Definitely not recommended. Back seat is very small. Looks spacious but after the front seats are set- no leg room at all in the back. Back hatch gets “confused” constantly. Not a good product at all.
2994,a year ago,5,"Is a good car, it is a good size for families of four persons. My mum hace this car and she drives to us all the days to the highschool. She bought it five years ago and it’s perfect. So i recommend you to buy this car!"
2995, a year ago,5,"I love this car, I used to have a bmw 1 series which was more expensive and much more difficult do drive. This is a very smooth drive and is affordable well worth the money, it is also comfortable and the petrol lasts a while"
2996, a year ago,4,I don't really like standard but I think this one's it okay to drive though it breaks down pretty quick so I don't know if I would recommend this to someone but then again it has the lasted us a good five years.
2997, a year ago,5,"I loved driving this car. A friend of mine let me drive his. I found that it drove very solid and it was well built.  I know that it was a bit of a gas guzzler, but it was affordable to buy so you have to decide which is important in terms of cost. I loved the feel though."
2998, a year ago,5,"Great family car, nice and spacious but not too big that its hard to park and manoeuvre. Nice and  comfortable and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new family sized car. Has some great features and it really is enjoyable to drive."
2999, a year ago,5,I like this car. It has a smooth ride and takes me places. It was stupid expensive to get a scratch fixed tho. Also the battery died and had to be replaced but it was in warranty so that’s good. But it was only 2 years old.
3000, a year ago,3,"I had an older model of a Ford Focus so the car has surely changed since I owned one. It was a decent car, visibility wasn’t as great as other cars I’ve driven"
3001, a year ago,5,The breaks are touchy-which is a good thing but it isn’t as aerodynamic as it should be. Going 50mph feels like 80.

3014, a year ago,2,"I had a 2001 Ford Focus and while I personally loved the car, it did not age well at all. I ended up replacing parts in the car that were worth more than the car itself. It didn’t last as long as it should’ve and I eventually had to turn it back in (for a mere $200)."
3015, a year ago,4,"Jamais déçu par les ford. 
Un moteur robuste et un design toujours sympa.
Bonnes performances, agréable à conduire et bonne tenue de route, sauf sur route mouillée.
Bon confort des sièges et habitacle. Moyennement chère en entretiens."

3018,a year ago,5,"2017 Ford Focus ST gets me a lot of looks and people complimenting on my car! I've only done a blow-off valve, wing riser, and windshield tint, but there is more to come. Rides comfortably, seats 5 with leg room, and lots of storage in the trunk."

3021, a year ago,5,"My hybrid is the best thing i could ever have gotten. she’s given me 70,000 miles in the past 5 years and has no signs of stopping anytime soon. the amount you save on gas alone makes her worth it. however be prepared everything is special when it comes to maintenance because it’s a hybrid."

3027, a year ago,5,"I've long been a fan of Ford and have just recently started rebuilding a 2008 Mustang GT/CS. This car was beat down when my husband and I purchased it. We've been working, little by little, for the last 2 years fixing the parts that needed fixing from the suspension to needing a new clutch and transmission. We've really enjoyed bringing this beauty back to its original splendor. I have to say, out of all of the parts we've had to replace, the engine was not one of them...to our great surprise Ford has really outdone themselves with the 4.6 single overhead cam engines. This engine has been through the wringer with whoever owned her before. They obviously never changed the oil or the plugs and coil packs. That being said, we had a compression test done to see where we stood and the readings blew us away. 98 psi with 2% variation. Ford has definitely proven, once again, to be the best. Their slogan, Built Ford Tough, fits."
3028, a year ago,4,Uses a lot of gasoline and it is difficult to park. However it is incredible when it comes to speed. It has an elegant and clean firm and overall it has Avery good size. It is a bit expensive  but  Worth it. I totally recommend as a family car or to someone who needs to travel a lot
3029, a year ago,4,"I have a 2010 Ford Focus, loaded with Bluetooth, heated leather seats, and sunroof, etc. It isn't the dream car or anything, but it's been more than dependable and I appreciate the features. It is a great car if you're looking for good gas mileage and something dependable."
3030, a year ago,3,"The Ford Focus Reliability Rating is 4.0 out of 5.0, which ranks it 27th out of 36 for compact cars. The average annual repair cost is $569 which means it has average ownership costs. Some people might even say that the Ford Focus didn't match the criteria given for the car and some people are mad about it."
3031, a year ago,5,"Great car especially for beginner drivers. Truly amazing and very easy to drive. It is reliable, small and very comfortable. Very easy to take care of and has a sports mode and you change gears which I love. Very affordable and don’t have to fill it up very often although I drive it everyday. Very savvy"
3032, a year ago,5,We have been always been a good fan of ford owned a mustang a ford focus ford edge and ford lincoln all have been great for the price we pay and no troubles at all 
3033, a year ago,3,I owned a pre used 2012 ford focus and I had a lot of problems with the transmission!
3034, a year ago,2,Not a fan of the focus! It reminded me of a wind up toy car. There was no room for anything
3035, a year ago,3,Transmission is terrible. I’ve had my 2014 focus serviced so many times and the entire transmission changed twice before 100km. Love the car otherwise but a HUGE expensive when things go wrong.
3036, a year ago,4,"Automakers like Ford and BMW said goodbye to several models at the end of 2019. This includes Ford, which is killing the Fiesta, Fusion, Taurus, and C-Max sedan and hatchback models as it shifts focus to crossovers and SUVs yup I could recommend it Ford Motor Company"

3041,a year ago,4,Very reliable. My number one vehicle brand.  You just can't go wrong with Ford.  They are well built. The only con I can think of is how the Dodge brothers stole their idea. It really depends on how you're buying. I would totally recommend.

3047,a year ago,5,"Kvalitní jízda, pro nenáročného řidiče značka ideál. Pro ženy výhoda velikosti auta 🥰 zaparkovat s ním skoro všude není vůbec žádný problém. Klasické opravy jen díky opotřebení a náhradní součástky nejsou předražené jako u některých jiných značek."

3063, a year ago,5,Ford Scape is a really good vehicle.

3072, a year ago,4,"The Ford brand lately has not given very good quality vehicles and this is no exception.

3115,a year ago,5,"My Ford Fiesta has performed so very well in the past one year that I really wanted to share my experience with everyone. I personally love driving and am an adventure freak. We are a small nuclear family of 4 people and move for outdoor trips as and when we get any chance. Thus, I wanted a car that was strong like an SUV, yet comfortable for a family drive. I had travelled in Fiesta once when my friend bought the car a few years back and was attracted to own it. I have driven the car on almost all possible terrains, be it rivers, mountainous terrains and patchy roads. The car is really comfortable to drive and the pickup is simply superb. I mean the car hardly takes any time to accelerate after one has put it in the first gear. The sitting is very comfortable for the driver as well as the passengers. It offers a comfortable drive for 5 adults. The power-steering actually runs like water. I found the gear shift and the AC very nice. I would like to conclude my review by saying that at the end of a year I am a really satisfied customer of Ford Fiesta."

3117, a year ago,5,"The first advantage of the 2018 Ford Escape is that it accelerates quickly. Compared to other models in the segment, this car can increase speed with more power thanks to its 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine that delivers an extreme capacity of 245 hp and 373 Nm of maximum torque"

3132, a year ago,5,"El carro con mejor rendimiento y comodidad del mercado, la comodidad de este no compite con nada"
3133,a year ago,4,Its a very good car and i have enjoyed every ride and experience with the car i have traveled for many days and its mileage is very very very very very very very very  good
3134,a year ago,5,"To start with, the new Focus is available with either a 1.0-litre EcoBoost petrol engine or 1.5-litre EcoBlue diesel.  The petrol is offered in power outputs of 85, 100 or 125ps, the most powerful of which hits 0-62mph in 10 seconds and can achieve up to 58.9 mpg on the WLTP-certified combined cycle.The 1.5-litre diesel comes in 95 and 120ps guises and is said to achieve up to 78.5 mpg – although at the end of a week’s testing, we’d notched up a fairly consistent 56.5 mpg.
As standard, it’s mated to a six-speed manual with a light and easy-going shift action, although we noticed a curious flat-spot in first gear (presumably a deliberate torque reduction to preserve the transmission) that made pulling out on to a busy roundabout trickier than it should be.
Away from first, the 120ps diesel is pleasingly punchy even with only a handful of revs on the clock, but it was rather noisy at idle, clattering and vibrating away to itself even when fully warmed up.  Thankfully, once on the move it settles down nicely.That’s just as well, because the new Focus is remarkably quiet.  Wind noise is almost entirely absent, even over the door mirrors at motorway speeds, while road and tyre noise from our ST-Line’s 17-inch wheels was surprisingly well insulated.The suspension, too, went about its business without announcing its endeavours to those in the cabin, and struck what seemed to us to be the perfect balance between comfort and composure.There’s that typical Ford trait of offering a sense of engagement to those that want it, without troubling the less enthusiastic buyers who don’t, but even an average driver will be aware that the Focus is easy to place on the road.
Worth mentioning is that ST-Line variants sit 10mm lower, while some of the lesser models sacrifice Ford’s latest independent suspension set-up for a cheaper twist-beam arrangement, so just be sure what you’re ordering."
3135,a year ago,5,"first things first, what anyone notices on the Fiesta is it’s brand new grille, something resembling another company’s grille Ford had to let go. Yes, that’d be Aston Martin. The new Fiesta gets a front end that has a starking similarity to the iconic Bond car. The new lights follow the Aston trend as well. They are large and slender and the hood has been modified to accommodate these new lights. On the rear the Fiesta looks as dreary as before. Apart from changing the sheet metal the backside doesn’t look any different. There is a constant theme of stream lining that has been maintained during the design of this car. I will say that this Fiesta did turn some heads while being driven around the city. I even had Fiesta owners come up to me and ask if I had modified the front end myself and were shocked when I told them that this was a new Ford design."
3136, a year ago,5,Excellent car to drive and comfortable especially for long journeys down the motorway. Acceleration is great and speed is better
3137,a year ago,3,It was very nice I think it was well set up but the color was not my favorite thing sooooooo😂

3139, a year ago,5,This car is probably one of my dream cars it was very very easy to drive it felt like if I was literally driving a cloud around the whole intire city and I just also really liked the outside as well it's so big and has a beautiful pretty color I really really loved it
3140,a year ago,5,Great and comfortable ride! Easy to maintain and easy on the gas! Safe but improvement on the locks as it is becoming a easy targeted car for robberies and break ins. Love my Ford though! Wish to own a Ranger too.
3141, a year ago,4,"I have only driven the hatchback. I liked the feel of the car itself and it handled well, but I hated the hatchback. There was virtually no trunk space."
3142, a year ago,4,"My husband currently drives a 2015 Ford Escape. I love it because I feel like it drives more like a car than an SUV. My husband, who is 6'2"" is still craving somethings bigger and with more leg room. The wheel well invades his driving space and makes him crazy. My only real issue with the car is that with two carseats, we can't really fit anyone else. And the trunk space is smaller than what we need."
3143, a year ago,4,I rented a 2012 Ford focus when I went to Florida. It was a great little car had everything that we needed it’s still had good space for a small vehicle and it ran really well.
3144, a year ago,4,This is my second Ford escape that I’ve owned. I enjoy having this vehicle it suits all of my needs it’s the right size. The only thing is that I wish that it had a bigger gas tank.

3154, a year ago,4,"The fusion is a very sentimental car for me. Very nice. Comfortable, easy to drive and lots of leg room If you have a full car. The only problem we had is the transmission went twice. It was problem after problem but when it worked it was fantastic. I'd recommend a newer model"

3156, a year ago,3,Its a decent small car however for my size family and for my needs its too small. The pick up isn't bad and the car has a lot of cool features however like I said prior I need a large suv to fit my daily life. Also the gas milage on this car is pretty awesome!

La consola es atractiva y de aspecto moderno. Hay mucho espacio de almacenamiento para objetos personales en todo el vehículo, e incluye otras características como el aire acondicionado automático de tres zonas y volante con calefacción que se ajusta eléctricamente en altura y profundidad.

El motor es otra de sus virtudes, pues es un V8 de 5.3 litros capaz de producir 355 caballos de fuerza y 383 lb-pie de torque, lo que es potencia más que suficiente para mover a la Tahoe junto con todos sus pasajeros y equipajes sin problemas. Este motor está emparejado con una transmisión automática de 6 velocidades que hace un buen trabajo al realizar cambios suaves y precisos."

3171, a year ago,3,"My Ford Focus is my everyday family car! It gets me from place to place with ease! The trunk is a great size for my families sports equipment, groceries, travel bags etc. I will say the the back seat is small excpecally with two carseats but my family fits comfortably. There are also many great features in my Ford Focus such as bluetooth connect. I can make & take calls, read text and listen to my favorite music just by asking my car to do it."
3172, a year ago,4,"It is perfect for traveling with the family, we accompanied us on an 8-hour trip and it was too much like traveling on it, the seats and everything was perfect for transport, taking into account that a 2-year-old baby and an older person accompanied us, sincerely  the best on the market"

The only thing is that its branded to be a family car but it's hard to get in the car especially of you're old. You have to kinda jump.

In fact, the Escape that Ford Philippines is bringing in is actually from the US."

3320, a year ago,2,"I love how my black Ford escape looks , but I DESPISE the auto start/stop engine technology. The auto start/stop is meant to save on gas by ""turning off"" the engine when you are at a complete stop, like red light or heavy traffic. Now this technology is great WHEN the car starts back up, but unfortunately I have stopped experiencing that. I have had some pretty scary experiences with this. After coming to a complete stop, and the car is still running, I will automatically get a pop-up saying ""put car in park, engine turning off"" and the car turns off😑...As the light turns green and there are cars behind me!!
Now, whenever I get in my car I need to make sure to press the Auto start/stop buttong OFF, or else my car will just turn off when on the road. 
Very scary!"

3329, a year ago,5,I love my escape it has been a great car. The gas mileage is pretty good for a small suv. It is my daily driver for work and has always been reliable. The price of the vehicle is not bad for all the tech you get and the nice materials inside. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a small suv to buy one. But goes for the eco boost with awd.
3330, a year ago,5,"I love my 2013 Ford Focus ST, it’s a blast to drive, gets pretty good gas mileage for a sporty hatchback, plenty of places to get aftermarket parts from and the car is pretty cheap compared to other cars that are like it"

3333, a year ago,5,i used to own a ford escape. it was one of my favorite cars. it ran great and lasted for such a long time without any issues. these cars are very affordable and it had great gas mileage. i would definitely recommend!
3334, a year ago,5,"Muy cómodo para viajar, la iluminación nocturna está bien si manejas de noche por carretera. Espacioso e Ideal para un viaje con amigos y familia"
3335, a year ago,2,This was a rental. It’s a small car. I felt like I was driving in an arcade simulator.
3336,a year ago,3,"It was nice and roomy, especially in the passenger seat where I sat, which was nice! Bonus for me was with two kids (under 4 years old) in car seats, there was lots of room in the back seats in between them. Down fall for me, even though trunk had lots of space. It just wasn't enough room for me with 2 big suitcases & stroller that I could not take with me. Overall, still a good ride!"
3337,a year ago,4,really nice car comes in many colors and different sizes Sheraton all the time but I would recommend if you were a starter this car will help you a lot in a process of you learning how to drive I'll have to say it's a very nice car you could get one of the older ones they were perfectly fine and I knew where one's I'll prefer one older ones they tend to work a lot better than the newer ones
3338,a year ago,5,The best vehicle to own I've owned two mustangs so far 2002-2011 and expect friendly service every dealership you walk into I've never been let down affordable deals often at my local dealerships near me. Highly recommend. Ford motor company ♥️
3339, 2 years ago,5,"Bought my car in 2017, and I absolutely love it. Best car I've had thus far. Super quick, and amazing in the winter. The one thing I've noticed about it, is that the headlights aren't as bright as I'd like them to be. Great price as well. Do recommend!"
3340, 2 years ago,5,"It really is a car that works perfect for my daily commute to work, home and with friend. It's really weird when I have a problem with the car"
3341,2 years ago,4,It was a really smooth ride with my cousins we enjoyed althrough the ride .the Seats were very comfy I adore them it was awesome and it was really spacious 😍.loved it
3342, 2 years ago,5,Love this car. very roomy and comfortable. i could definitely see any type of person driving it. not too expensive either.
3343,2 years ago,4,"I was very happy traveling around Mexico City on this beautiful car, but my biggest problem was that I'm a ""Hobbit"" and was very difficult to me to get down, I love the space inside, I felt me very well there."
3344,2 years ago,5,"I really enjoy to travel in the Ford fiesta, since this car was on sale my biggest dream was to have one, my daddy had one three or four years ago, I remember that I used to fall asleep on the back because it's really comfortable, I love it"
3345,2 years ago,5,"I think Ford Focus it's a very faster and comfortable car, I like to go to the supermarket or to the city mabye on a free day traveling in this car, my cousin has one and I really love it, it has a lot of space for my things and my cousin's items too. I really like it."
3346, 2 years ago,5,"The car floats on the road! It’s wide and really spacious inside, the car is great for road drives with family 😇"
3347, 2 years ago,5,I love this car its just so comfy to drive and less cost specially if your using diesel gas it also come with very comfortable chairs.
3348,2 years ago,5,"I'm not an expert in vehicles but for me this car is perfect! The size is right, the ride is comfortable, the room in the back seat is amazing! The tech in this car is most impressive coming from a 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid that still runs fine but drives like a truck. This Escape looks and drives more like a car with really great all new styling."
3349, 2 years ago,5,"My Ford Focus drove me all the way across Australia! Very reliable car and great fuel economy, which is the main thing I look for when buying a car. My services are much cheaper compared to when I had a European car brand. No complaints so far."
3350, 2 years ago,4,"Really good family car. It is very roomy, especially for kids that play sports because it has a very good  back for all sports equipment. Would recommend for parents with kids that are involved in sports."
3351, 2 years ago,3,"Spacious and comfortable, great little family car. Boot is smaller than would like! Runs well and is affordable! It's just not the flashiest"

3355, 2 years ago,2,"My partner had a fiesta, I urged him to trade it in. The air conditioner would never work, everytime he took it to the dealership they said it did when they checked and it couldn't possibly. They kept finding issues for him to fix and it was a money pit. It was bought new and was only a few years old. I wouldn't recommend this vehicle at all."
3356, 2 years ago,4,"It is a realy good car, I like how you can save money in gas because it don't require to much money to fill the tank."
3357, 2 years ago,4,Not bad. Not thrilled by ford products as they typically feel cheaply made but this one was alright
3358, 2 years ago,1,Felt very cheap. Very plasticky and not held together well. I would never buy this. It sounded like you were driving in a soda can
3359, 2 years ago,4,I would really like to own a car. I would love to have Ford since I know this brand is a good brand.  I always saw this in every english movie hitting and banging the this brand of car and the artist are still okay.  Hahaha #Cars #Ford #Future #Hopes #Dream
3360, 2 years ago,4,At first I was very confused about car and all process to buy but when I visit showroom every employee have acknowledged me and I really love this car so soon to drive and it's really affordable 😍😍
3361, 2 years ago,5,This car has been amazing from day 1. I have a 2017 Ford Focus that I just love. I drive over 700 miles a week and I’ve had this car for a couple months without a problem. I recommend for those who like to speed or those who just like to drive a lot
3362, 2 years ago,3,It seems pretty good on the road. I hate to actually purchase one myself. Even used they are quite expensive. They seem safe though and I am glad. I don't have much else to say about this car as I only drove it once or twice in my lifetime. Maybe if I drove one more I would have a better opinion.
3363, 2 years ago,3,I barely remember these cars but my great grandma owned one. She said it was the greatest car to have for her age. She was in her 80's at the time. She drove it to visit her husband and her daughter. I miss her a lot. I miss riding in the vehicle with her too.
3364, 2 years ago,4,My friend owns one if these and it is honestly the smoothest ride I have ever had in a car. It is super easy to handle on the road and I love all the technology features inside. Especially the built in Bluetooth. Not a fan of the drivers side being the only automatic window though.
3365, 2 years ago,4,"It Is practical and fast. its seats are comfortable, it uses little fuel, in short practical comfortable AND good"
3366,2 years ago,5,"Really nice car, I've owned it since 2012, hasn't given me more than 2 problems since then, easy to get replacement pieces in the country. I'll love it if they had more variety of models, it's an affordable vehicle. I'll recommend it for family transportation."
3367, 2 years ago,3,So many problems with this car and quite loud overall! Wouldn’t buy it again if I’m being honest
3368, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. It's a great four door small family car. I love it for my weekly errands
3369, 2 years ago,5,Super roomy and great gas mileage. Really comfortable for a small road trip. I definitely recommend
3370, 2 years ago,4,We've had issues with the brakes in the front and the bolts like to come loose on the rotors. Other than that our car is great!
3371, 2 years ago,5,"It is an excellent product, very functional and practical , In my personal experience, the performance it provides is very satisfactory."
3372, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car, easy to maneuver, good on gas, and roomy. Nice family vehicle. Good for vacation, camping, everyday commuting."
3373, 2 years ago,4,We purchased a Shelby Cobra two years ago. It's super fun to drive on twisty roads. The back seat is so hard to get in and out of so it isn't practical for more than one passenger. The gas consumption is exactly what you would expect from a V8. I don't like that I have to take it to the dealership to have the oil changed. I do love how the seats hug my body so I don't slide around.
3374,2 years ago,5,I love my car! Im not the most confident driver so need a car i feel comfortable in and the fiesta is a great car for me as its not to big so i find it easier to drive and park. Its also a reliable car so i dont need to worry about things constantly going wrong with it.
3375, 2 years ago,4,It's not that much good car in my opinion. It is very large at its edges. It's seat are not to much comfortable. The company should look over its confort . It's expensive in comparison by comfort and reliable. I will recommend it if you want to hire it in ola or uber to make money.
3376, 2 years ago,4,Its a nice car which is very spacious and pretty face. I don't know the pros and cons of the car as I haven't driven it but I've ridden it a lot of times
3377, 2 years ago,5,"Its a nice and comfortable car for daily driving, i personally use it mainly for work, i have the ecoline 2013 model, so it doesn’t have the most power, but its fun to drive with. I’m 21 btw so this comes from a young guy"
3378, 2 years ago,4,"I think this is a very practical car. Things hardly go wrong & when they do the car parts are not too expensive.
I think it has a smooth drive but I feel like the car feels very heavy to drive.
I would recommend for someone who needs a bigger car with large boot space."
3379, 2 years ago,5,"Amazing, comfortable. It's the best for kids, 
spacious and safe for road travel. 
We love traveling to Orlando, universal park, and this vehicle gives us the necessary comfort."
3380, 2 years ago,4,I don’t drive I’ve been in a lot of vehicles ford seems ok but they don’t last long I really don’t know much 
3381, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love this car- it was the first one I test drove when I started my new car search, and I feel in love in the first few minutes. Quiet, comfortable, and enough space for my family.  It was exactly what we were looking for in an upgraded family vehicle for less than I thought I would have to spend."
3382,2 years ago,5,"A wonderful, comfortable, spacious panel, good direction, especially the passengers feel very comfortable, both static and tactical are perfect."
3383, 2 years ago,3,"There is a good car, but the only bad thing is that the car is to little and short, you can't charged with a lot of weight, but is very economic with the gas, a good car to drive in the city."
3384, 2 years ago,4,"We bought our 2003 Escape in 2015. In the last five years, we've put about 80K miles on it (now has about 180K) and is now needing some serious work. It has been a good vehicle for us considering the mileage and cost to maintain! I like the older body style better than the current models because I find the current models have very little leg room. I had my daughter in her rearfacing car seat on the passenger side and I had to have the front passenger seat so far forward that I didn't have sufficient leg room. I'm 5'3"" so this is an unusual complaint for me."
3385,2 years ago,5,"It easy to drive and comfortable, good at the look.
Don't like too much the color, o though it would be more dark.
The sound could be better, with more quality.
It kinda expensive, but it's a car, you can choose something more affordable and with the same characteristics"
3386, 2 years ago,4,"I had the Focus See and loved it, tons of cute lighting options, one of my favorites for day to day.
Super great on gas, and came with an amp for my stereo system as well."

3389, 2 years ago,5,"Es un carro muy bonito, es cómodo y es rendidor. Sin palabras con este carro el único problema es el espacio ya que no caben muchas personas pero si lo utilizas para uso personal sin problemas, además de que es muy pequeño, cabe en todos lados, me encanta"
3390, 2 years ago,4,"We had it as a rent a car. Was good on gas and spacious for the two of us, our luggage, golf clubs and groceries"
3391, 2 years ago,4,"It is good for ladies, its stylish and sleek, there's a variety of colors you can choose in but the down side is its too consuming of gas so it can be a little pricey."
3392, 2 years ago,5,Somewhat this Ford Siesta comes with an easy and affordable at all cost. It suits a person who is a go lucky one. Sure does it can fit you.
3393,2 years ago,2,"Saver yes, económic, will take you from point a to point b, but... we are not talking of quiality, missing technology, everything it plastics, problems with keys, buttons ,Cranks, transmition, Any way it could to a grandma that only use it for going to the market and black home, just a city car . Thanks ."
3394,2 years ago,4,"Decent budget priced small SUVs.  I've never owned one but my brother in law has.  He loves his.  I've ridden in it.  It's comfortable enough for a small SUV, but it's nothing special or spectacular.  Would I buy one?  Possibly if the price was right."
3395, 2 years ago,5,I absolutely love my ford !! I have a 2015 model and have had no problems. I do wish it was built more like the older models and less like a car.
3396, 2 years ago,3,"My fusion was regularly in the garage having warranty work done. Once my warranty was done, I got rid of it. Nice looking junk."
3397, 2 years ago,4,"Love For cars and trucks, grew up in them. They are very reliable and sturdy automobiles. The new look of the Escape is nice it doesn’t look like a robot car or a box like other brands very sleek and modern"

3400, 2 years ago,4,The comfort is high.  But speed for his motor is too low. Also audio system is so so good. And basses amazing
3401, 2 years ago,4,I have had my 2013 does escape for about 2 years and I absolutely love it. I had previously been driving a small Saturn ion so this escape was a big upgrade. It handles well in the winter and is efficient with gas. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who likes a bit of space and good handling.
3402,2 years ago,5,I had my Fiesta ST for nearly 4 years. Best car I have ever owned. Just amazing to drive and so much fun. Recommend 10/10. Great price for a hot hatch and built my credit perfectly for my mortgage 😆
3403,2 years ago,5,"I LOVE my Ford Fusion it fits my family perfectly. I always had minivans or SUVS to big, to expensive on gas. The Ford Fusion is perfect and VERY SAFE! Also very affordable.

We are currently looking into a newer model. My husband likes the body shape of the new ones. I like the body shape of the ones a little bit older they have a more box shape and they look like a Mercedes-Benz or Lexus to me. Without the price tag of those vehicles. Any kind of Ford Fusion is good with me they are GREAT vehicles."
3404, 2 years ago,5,Great on gas and drive very fast!!! I love my Ford focus. Never needed a big car this is just right for me. Only problem I have ever had was needing to get brakes.

3411, 2 years ago,4,Okay feel weird reviewing a literal car on here but I love my lil baby focus. It’s such a great reliable car. A perfect first car and a perfect family car! Good all around

3420, 2 years ago,3,I am personally not a huge fan of ford unless it is their trucks. There isn't usually a ton of space anywhere whether it is in the car and you have adults trying to fit in each seat or the truck for long trips or getaways when needed. For is great for trucks but so easy for them to break down or have problems with.
3421,2 years ago,4,This is my second ford fusion that I have owned. I like that it is a large enough sedan and in a color that I love

3427,2 years ago,5,"This photo was taken awhile back. I liked my 2014 Ford Mustang. I have not upgraded to the newer one due to a smaller back seat, but I did enjoy this one. My vehicle unfortunately was broken into multiple times and I began having issues with car due to taking it to the shop because of the issues it began to have due to break-ins, so I had to get another vehicle. I have to give Ford and this mustang five stars because they were awesome when I had this car."

3432,2 years ago,5,"I drive a 2010, light green Ford Focus. This car was my grandmother's that she bought new and it has become mine in the past couple of years. It is a great car that has had little to no problems. The color is a hit or miss with people. Some people love it. Some people hate it. I personally love it! It makes me stand out and everyone around my small town can recognize it because hardly no one around has one like it."
3433, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. It is great on gas mileage and it has a decent amount of power. It is very comfortable to drive and it is spacious in the back. There is a dent amount of trunk space for a sedan as well.

3442, 2 years ago,5,"Particularmente es de mis autos favoritos, tengo la ventaja de manejar uno y tiene la ventaja de ser muy cómodo además de ser lujoso, sus sensores de movimiento facilita el fácil parkeo del automóvil, por lo que recomiendo ampliamente este modelo, sí te gusta la velocidad es ideal para empezar pues su aerodinamismo permite el desplazamiento dentro de la Ciudad y en carretera sientes ir en un avión."

I have been with the car stopped for months due to system failures, it is failure after failure. Other vehicles I have used have I have been of quality and have not presented this type of problem."

3449, 2 years ago,2,"Nice car, I mean it was pretty..The interior was nice and all of the bells and whistles that came along with the fully loaded 2018 version we purchased brand new, but it had so many recalls for things like the transmission and it even like stalled out a few times, definitely wasn't out of gas or in bad shape it was practically still brand new, no accidents or anything but it legit stalled ON THE FREEWAY, like terrifying, I was so glad we were in the right lane and got over in time to not cause an accident"
3450, 2 years ago,2,"Not a good ride, very small and almost cheap feeling inside. The one bonus is fuel economy. I wouldn’t feel overly safe if I were to get in an accident. "

Small problems occur here and there and sure I have had a hand full of issues since buying the car, but overall I would say get something else... I’ve put more money into this “well taken care of car”  in repairs than i have payments..."
3457, 2 years ago,3,"Varias personas que conozco han tenido está marca y ha resultado una pesadilla, cada semana al taller. Fuera de eso es cómodo y compacto. Pero yo no lo r comendaria."
3458, 2 years ago,5,I like the design and the seats are comfortable. It’s a good car and I hope I get mine soon
3459, 2 years ago,5,Super reliable car! I have only been a passenger in one but it safe and steady and an easy ride. The ride is smooth and you cannot over speed in this car really. It is affordable about mid budget depending on what model you get. I really think it's a cute cosy car.
3460,2 years ago,5,"My friend dirve one and it s ok for him. 
Its a practical car and its very good for long roads with many backpacks."
3461, 2 years ago,3,"we have had this car for 10 years, they have improved a lot, although this very small is very good.  I have no positive or bad comments"
3462, 2 years ago,5,"Excelente camioneta! Su tamaño, su comodidad, su fácil y suave forma de manejar lo hace única en el mercado. Ideal para ir de paseo a la playa con la familia y el perro o un paseo de noche por la ciudad, o para lo que quieras!!!"
3463, 2 years ago,4,"In my country these most profitable cars that there are, this brand of cars is one of the best with great mileage capacity, hardly for a place."
3464, 2 years ago,5,I own the hybrid version of this car and it is amazing. The gas mileage is wonderful and even though I drive frequently I rarely have to fill my tank.
3465,2 years ago,5,"Es un automóvil completamente práctico de buen tamaño y muy benéfico para el uso diario o viajes cortos, fácil de manejar y a pesar de que en ocasiones se lleven a cabo viajes largos resultan ser del todo placenteros y muy cómodos, una buena opción para poca gente y disfrutar el día a día 😊"
3466, 2 years ago,3,Es un auto pequeño pero cómodo para una familia de tres. Mejoraría los asientos los aria un poco más cómodos
3467, 2 years ago,4,"Amplio, cómodo, con tablero de funciones fácil de manejar, es amplio en la parte de atrás por lo que no te sentirás apretado si vas con otra persona."
3468, 2 years ago,5,"Super well equipped, nice car, nice colors. It look elegant on the inside I really liked it"
3469,2 years ago,5,"El ford fusion es un exelente coche y Es un auto muy comodo, puedes viajar a cualquier lado con el, y en el mercado mexicano sigue siendo un auto muy atractivo y diamativo es muy hermoso y es muy recomendado por la marca norteamericana
Presio desde: MXN621,200"
3470,2 years ago,4,"This vehicle is very safe and reliable. It has a lot of technology built into its interior design. The board has a very aerodynamic design that with the play of lights makes it look very modern.

Something I do not like that I come from a Honda CRV, this Ford is less comfortable. Mechanically it has not given me almost problems, only its normal maintenance and some worn part.

3473, 2 years ago,5,"No se escribrir aún bien en inglés, pero es muy recomendable la marca de auto, no he tenido uno pero tengo amigos que tienen carro y me recomiendan el ford, es excelente la marca"
3474, 2 years ago,5,"I think is a very good SUV . It is spacious and comfortable. I really like that you can reclined all the back seats. Another point very important for me is the security and high. Where in live it's raining all the time and sometimes the road it's not the better. In addition, the Ford customers service is better than another companies. I love my SUV."
3475, 2 years ago,5,"Tuve un fusion 2011, mi primer auto el mejor de todos, aún lo extraño? Que les puedo decir, excelentes manejo nunca fallaba. Lo recomiendo? Claro que si."
3476,2 years ago,4,"Tuve algunos problemas con la transiciónal principio, hicieron válida mi garantía y tengo ya 5 años con el, era seminuevo cuando lo compre pero del año y la verdad, es muy bueno para responderte, cuando frenas es inmediato y cuando arrancas es al segundo también, eso me gusta mucho, es mi cómplice 🙌🏾."
3477, 2 years ago,4,"I’m a learner 🚘 so I go out in my car a few times a week with my dad who teaches me, I’ve got a Ford Fusion hatchback 2003 1.6ltr I absolutely love my car as it’s so easy to drive and cheap to fix since it’s a ford, I got this car to learn in as I wasn’t too bothered about knocking it about and scratching it here and there and it drives like a dream! Only slight downside... it’s quite a large car but you soon get the hang of it, would highly recommend buying a car like this for a first car! 😇"
3478, 2 years ago,4,"I drove my friend’s Ford Fusion couple of times. It was a hybrid so the fuel consumption was pretty great for the car this size. One thing I did not like is interior material, it felt a little cheap."
3479, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford Escape is an excellent car, in my opinion. I have only rode passenger, but it was a great experience for everyone in the car. The seats are made of really nice leather that is comfortable and durable. I would take this car on a road trip. "
3480, 2 years ago,5,"I was really satisfied with my Ford Focus. It was roomy, good on gas and it lasted me the longest out of all my cars. I really loved it. I wish I still had it :( it went everywhere on the east coast from New York to Florida."
3481,2 years ago,3,"Es un buen auto, aunque su diseño no es de mis favoritos, se me hace algo bofo pero corre bien tiene interiores bonitos, no se si lo recomendaría, debe cada quien tomar su desicion, depende lo que busques es lo que compraras"
3482,2 years ago,5,"Toyota’s are very good cars that rarely brakes and last a lifetime, literally a lifetime. I would not change anything. Very economical in gas."
3483,2 years ago,2,"Ford is unreliable but affordable. This car isn't big enough for my family's needs but I'm sure it's fine for others. Personally I hate that they all appear to have electrical issues and constantly need major parts replaced. The Ford I have now, I'm trying to get rid of. I can't wait."
3484, 2 years ago,1,I hate this car!!! Not sure if it’s just the 2012 model but I’ve had so many problems with this car! So many recalls and not worth it. Currently my radio doesn’t work.
3485, 2 years ago,5,"The best, a product of excellent quality . I highly recommend it. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. 100% recommend"
3486, 2 years ago,5,"The best, a product of excellent quality . I highly recommend it. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. 100% recommend"

3488,2 years ago,4,"Great car, drives smooth and good on gas. There isn’t that much space inside but overall great first car. "
3489, 2 years ago,4,A good car for me because I can not afford a new car but it’s very comfortable and is amazing
3490, 2 years ago,5,"I give it a very good review, because I like the product, I am an active consumer and all I recommend is because it really is of the best quality"
3491, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2013 for a few months now.  It's small, not much space between the front and rear seats.  I has great speed and good on gas. The drivers window power button does not work sometimes and I've learned it's a common issue with this car."
3492, 2 years ago,4,"I’m not a massive car person, aslong as it gets me from a to b I’m happy. This was my mums car and then I bought it off them when she got a new car. Drives great, runs great, aside from a few issues, it’s been reliable so far."
3493, 2 years ago,5,One of the best vehicles I owned. I really liked my escape. I would absolutely look at purchasing again.
3494, 2 years ago,3,"The Ford Fiesta is great on gas mileage. However, my car doesn’t have cruise control and I do find it difficult to get around in the winter."
3495, 2 years ago,5,"My Ford Fiesta is my first ever car, and I love it and am so thankful to have a car so reliable and also in my opinion anyways; a cool looking car. It’s just the right size for myself and I would definitely recommend if you were looking to get a cheaper but reliable car."
3496,2 years ago,4,Well I’m not a big car person. But this gets me from point A to point B. I haven’t had too many issues with it over the years
3497,2 years ago,5,"Love my fiesta.  Perfect size for me. Lots of room in the boot. Runs smoothly. Is very quiet, can't hear the engine running at all. The seats are comfy. Very affordable car. Great little runner."
3498, 2 years ago,3,It’s an ok car. It gets me from one location to another which is great. This was my first ever car so it’s not something I will be keeping for a while. It’s had it’s fair share of problems with the engine and has had a bunch of recalls.
3499, 2 years ago,4,It’s a cute adorable car. I got great gas mileage in it! Only bad things is that it is a smaller car so if you’re a bigger person it’s a tight fit
3500, 2 years ago,5,"A friend of mine has this car, and I really like the aerodynamics of the vehicle, its economy is incredible, although it is small but its speed is incredible, I would buy one for myself"
3501, 2 years ago,5,"I had the opportunity to have one of these for 15 days, it was rented, it is a very safe, comfortable car, good acceleration and economic, this I highly recommend"
3502, 2 years ago,5,"Excelente producto me encanta el acabado y lo detallado, se nota la calidad en cada pieza"
3503, 2 years ago,5,"I love my fiesta, it has great power and is the perfect size car for me to go shopping etc, also it's free road tax which is even better!"
3504, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car!  It is a great size for an SUV being not too big, and allows for a very easy and smooth driving experience!"
3505, 2 years ago,3,This car was not the best. Had engine issues early on but the staff at ford were very helpful and resolved any issues.
3506, 2 years ago,5,Loving Ford brand this my second time getting a ford. My new 2013 Ford Edge is good vehicle the first owes took good care of it running great.
3507, 2 years ago,4,It's a nice car lots of room good on gas and it lasted quite a while I really loved that car but with commute everyday it was driven to much to often and just could not last
3508, 2 years ago,4,This SUV is very roomy for its size. Had great fuel milage.  Not very fond of the body style as it makes it hard to work on it. Not to much I would improve on as it is a great car. I do find them a little pricey for what you get.
3509, 2 years ago,5,"It is very comfortable, I really like this truck, the only defect I see is that it is very spend a lot of gasoline but for everything else it is very good"
3510, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford escape, it's got excellent features and it's comfortable. It's the perfect crossover between an SUV and a car. Not too big but not too small. It was also decently priced when I purchased it new a few years ago. I like how smoothly it drives too."
3511, 2 years ago,4,"I love this car because it's so high of the ground the design  inside the car is so beautiful check it  out ,I love it"
3512, 2 years ago,4,"Excellent product for those who are looking for a car for a family outing, my parents have a red cedan fiesta, super comfortable, but as I already wrote above. most suitable family to ride."
3513, 2 years ago,5,"Wonderful car, super comfortable, spacious, doesn’t feel like it’s at high speed, great car to ride. I have experience with him for almost 1 year, I don't see any negative points in addition to the spare tire it is very thin compared to an asphalt motorcycle tire. Super recommended! Excellent car. If you have any questions please contact me."
3514, 2 years ago,3,I prefer the automatic version of this than the manually. It’s comfy but not something that isn’t to bad.. it’s really good and when I got to use it.. the sound system was really bad ... so nothing much ... it’s not that high too.. the seats are soft. Less leg room☹️
3515, 2 years ago,3,Es un coche para todos los días muy bueno y resistente os lo recomiendo muchísimo a todos
3516, 2 years ago,5,Wonderful car. Has so many great features! The sound system is beyond average for a sedan. Seats are very comfortable. Def recommend to anyone who looking for a daily.
3517, 2 years ago,5,Very economical car for the engine size and weight of the car.  Allows you to make various after market configurations that further enhance the car's technology.
3518, 2 years ago,4,One of my friends on this part and stressful eight is great so beautiful from the inside and outside￼
3519, 2 years ago,5,Love my car very good on gas I have the hybrid version of the fusion and it gets up really fast easy to clean and great for getting me from point a to point B
3520,2 years ago,4,Love this vehicle. Lots of room for the boys and great trunk space for camping! Can even take the dogs for drives with the trunk space! Has great sound and loads of plug ins for dvd players. Good on gas. Nice smooth ride! Would recommend to other families!
3521, 2 years ago,5,I can't wait to purchase this car is one of my dream card! I believe it's great on fuel and it looks great it's a lot better than a minivan LOL
3522,2 years ago,3,"It was a decent enough car. It basically was a car of convenience. It just got me to where I was going. It was dependable, though & resiliant. It never did let me down."
3523, 2 years ago,4,"Love, love, love this vehicle!!! I had a small hatchback before this car and we decided we needed something for our growing family and it is perfect."
3524, 2 years ago,5,"The Ford brand for me is the best among all, it is the brand that owns my favorite cars such as the Mustang, F Series, Expedition and Excursion, since I was little I liked the brand and I have had 3 models which was a total success like the Taurus 2000, Escape 2001 and currently I have Edge 2007, in my country Dominican Republic I am the President of TeamFord, which is a group of people who have Ford cars and we meet to socialize and get good discounts from suppliers of the brand, Ford is the best, I LOVE FORD"
3525, 2 years ago,4,"Its a nice suitable car, comfy and modern-ish but I personally wouldn't but it for myself as its not my type of car"
3526, 2 years ago,5,"My mother has a 2014 of this and it has truly been the best vehicle she has ever had, I use it sometimes and the comfort and safety it gives me is unmatched, I recommend to anyone who wants to buy a low-cost CUV cost and economics this is the best option Ford Escape"
3527, 2 years ago,5,"mann this car is so amazing , i mean the interior? its amazeballs trust me if you're thinking of buying it broo go for it , the smell and feel of its luxurious leather is amazing,color black and red look so elegant that they can put all other brands to shameci would definitely recommend it."
3528, 2 years ago,5,The times I've gotten to drive an escape I've enjoyed the ride. They drive nice and the suspension is superb
3529, 2 years ago,3,"I owned a Ford fusion as my first ""big girl purchase"". I liked it for about 6 months and it easily became my least favorite car. I had lots of mechanical issues and I didn't run as well as I feel it should have. I personally would not recommend unless you're a die hard ford fanatic."
3530, 2 years ago,4,"A 2013 Ford focus was my second car. I absolutely loved it and the only reason I changed was due to having another baby and needing more room on my car. The car itself was spacious, the boot could fit a travel system and shopping with no problem :) We found it very good on fuel as we had the eco model. Loved the car!"
3531,2 years ago,5,"This was the best care ive ever owned, after having it for only a year it was totalled by a drunk driver. Then we purchased a newer edge which is terrible!"
3532,2 years ago,3,"Though i like the company itself, the ford edge just falls short of the normal ford standards in my opinion. Not only have we already had to correct 4 recalls on the car, but we also have an ongoing break booster issue that no living mechanic can seem to fix! Would recommend ford, would NOT recommend the ford edge."
3533,2 years ago,1,It had so many recalls everytime you turned around I would never by this kind of car again. The trans kept skipping the set belt was recalled.. I love Ford product that's all I'll buy. Not I will never own a Fiesta. I wouldn't recommend buying one but that's my opinion
3534, 2 years ago,5,"I love my ford fiesta Max, it is my first car and was the best decision bought it, I feel very comfortable, safe and very well"
3535, 2 years ago,3,"I like the Ford Escape as a driver, but am always horribly uncomfortable as a passenger. The seats are comfy, but the wrong height or angle for me and cause bad knee pain. The size of the car is great....it's small enough that it's easy to park, but big enough to haul a good amount of stuff in the back. All things considered, it's an ok car, but I was super happy when I got rid of mine."
3536,2 years ago,5,I don’t have a knowledge with cars but I liked it. The airconditioner works perfect and everything. It works smoothly but it’s kinda expensive I think. Plus it can accommodate almost 7-8 passengers. It’s a family friendly car.
3537, 2 years ago,5,My mom has one if these. Shes had it for a few years. Had alot of problems with their being a leak on the front. Once that was fixed it way way better. It gets kinda crappy gas mileage. But other than that its not a bad car.
3538, 2 years ago,3,This was a great car when I first turned 18 now that I'm much older I feel that this care falls apart a lot. I honestly should stop investing in it and buy a new one. 😔
3539, 2 years ago,5,"Nice, it has enough space for you and your family! Most definitely a family car! Rides clean!"
3540, 2 years ago,5,Dura muchos años siempre y cuando cuides bien es como un bebé y hay q mimarlo ❤️.
3541,2 years ago,5,"My first car ever was a Ford ! I loved driving that car , to be exact, it was a Ford Focus in dark green ! I bought it with my own money and was very proud to drive it! Focus’s are fun to drive in or be a passenger. It’s a nice ride. I love the way it looks and would recommend to friends and family any day! Great car !"
3542, 2 years ago,5,"I love for 2013 Pearl White Ford Edge. It has many positive attributes. My vehicle has a full navigational system, has multi colored lighting on the floor boards, and has Sirius satellite radio. It was very affordable. I would definitely recommend this suv to any mom with children."
3543, 2 years ago,5,I used to own an escape. It was nice. New off the lot and I never had an issue. Unfortunately I didn't get to keep it due to my divorce
3544, 2 years ago,5,"When I was on tour got in this car and I liked it very much, it is comforting and I like very much the truth brings me many memories"
3545, 2 years ago,5,"I drove a 2017 during an internship. I found that it rode very smooth and the back up camera was supreme. It bends as you turn the steering wheel so you know exactly where you're going. I'd say for the luxury look and feel, this vehicle is adequately priced."
3546, 2 years ago,3,"Gets you from point a to point b but from people that I know that have owned them, they have had engine issues."
3547, 2 years ago,5,"it is one of my favorite suv's it is like, modern, elegant, it has all the necessary technology and it is very easy to drive, it depends on the version it brings automatic parking (it practically parks itself) which is a genius ... it is ford trojan horse ... I recommend it 100%"
3548, 2 years ago,5,although it is very long to park it is very comfortable!  It also has all the technology to make it an experience to drive it ... if you have no problems with parking (like me) it is an excellent option!
3549, 2 years ago,4,the focus automatic transmission has always caused problems ... it is a transmission that has a different driving mode and a different maintenance.
3550, 2 years ago,4,"I’ve had my car almost 6 years now, it’s great on gas. It’s fully loaded so I have heated seats and a nice sun and moon roof which is my favorite along with the cool color changing lights on the floors and doors. It’s very reliable and never had an issue. I just wish it was a little more spacious in the back there’s not much room for an adult sitting back there"
3551,2 years ago,3,"My husband's last car was a Focus and I hated riding in it... every time he would accelerate, the car would chug and take forever to accelerate."
3552, 2 years ago,4,I had a lot of problems with transmission in this vehicle.  It is comfy for being small. It gets great gas milage.
3553, 2 years ago,4,"Such a fun little car! Had good amenities, good touch screen. Felt very light. I think was rather cheaply made, like plasticy. I enjoyed the car a lot and it got great mileage but im not sure about longevity or safety tbh. It lasted well for about 3 years when i leased it"
3554, 2 years ago,4,"Very spacious on the inside, with great features. The Apple car play is in most packages at this point and is amazing."
3555, 2 years ago,3,Very small car and not really a smooth drive. Would not purchase one but it gets people from point A to point B!
3556, 2 years ago,4,"Love the height of the car but had to give 4 stars because it is not spacious on the inside. I test drive a 2019 and the inside feels like a Ford Focus. If they set up the interior to be more spacious like the fusion, it would be more worth it. Features are overall great but package pricing on fords is expensive."
3557, 2 years ago,5,This vehicle is great! It drives like a dream practically by itself! It has awesome safety features that help you navigate the road. The only thing that's missing is the CD player.
3558,2 years ago,5,Ford Escape  i had 2005 automatic 4 cylinder i loved it was excellent on gas no problems only basic upkeep on it i got new vehicle
3559, 2 years ago,4,"I had this car, a 2010 Ford fiesta , it was my first car and I loved every part of it. It blew up due to an electric problem... Thought I would recommend anyone to buy it, it had an incredible strength and was really fast! It was comfortable inside. 2010 automatic model had a problem and it would get hot very frequently but if you solved it it was all ..."
3560, 2 years ago,4,"I like this car, but damages every few months; I've seen that it is always the same problem... I'm not sure if the new models are better in that. Also it is really fast and looks very good... I've only drive it a few times but if the problem isn't there any more I would recommend it"
3561, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car. It’s tiny enough to take it every where for a busy college student because it doesn’t used up the gas much. Very light and takes you everywhere, also durable. Maintain it with the dealer’s recommendation and it’ll be with you for years."
3562, 2 years ago,4,"I owned a Ford escape before my Honda CR-V. Despite the Ford escape being much more affordable to purchase  used, its not nearly as reliable as my Honda. The Ford escape is much roomier and overall feels much more like an SUV. If you are going for a larger vehicle, I liked the Ford escape, but I wouldn't expect a lot of reliability after 175,000 or 200,000 miles."
3563, 2 years ago,5,"Muy buen carro, yo tengo ese carro y me encanta, comenzando es un carro muy liviano y muy fácil de manejar, los asientos muy cómodos y amplios en la parte da atrás; el único defecto que yo le veo es que no tiene ventilas para el aire acondicionado en la parte de atrás y eso llega a ser un problema cuando llevas a mucha gente atrás. Pero de ahí en más es un excelente carro y lo recomiendo para jóvenes y principiantes "
3564,2 years ago,5,"Such a brilliant car, my dad had one and it was so easy to run around in and didn't cost a lot. He was a fan of Jaguars but that got a bit expensive for school runs so a Fiesta it was! Perfect little car and would love one to start out when I begin driving!"
3565, 2 years ago,5,"The Ford focus is a very well manageable car. It has a great interior and drive smoothly, I highly recommend. ￼￼"
3566, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford fusion is a nice and somewhat spacious car. It drives very smoothly and has updated features to fit the more modern look, I highly recommend. ￼"
3567, 2 years ago,5,"Is a nice car very economic, it have a good space between seats, is good for a person that drive a lot"
3568, 2 years ago,5,"Fords are always long lasting cars. SUV with space for a family with kids, and or work"
3569,2 years ago,5,"Es uno de los mejores autos que maneje, me encanta el modelo es justo lo que necesito para manejar, el estilo es único a los demás autos, si me darían a escoger entre este y otro autos escogería mil veces este modelo porque en verdad me encantó"
3570, 2 years ago,3,My mom owns a ford escape hybrid. Its not a bad vehicle but I hate the turning radius on it. I wouldn't buy it just because of that.
3571, 2 years ago,5,"It was a great car, sadly I only got to do a test drive. The engine was very strong and the seats were very comfortable. The car itself looks amazing, I love how modern its design is. I would totally buy it if I didn't have a car already. If you rae looking for a family car you dhould give this one a go!"
3572, 2 years ago,4,"Really up to date on technology car! Has all of the comfort and luxary, spacious trunk and back seat, so smooth it feels like driving a boat! Downside is it's cheaply made. Like plastic. But a very very good price overall, I've only had it about three years so im not sure what type of problems pop up as it ages"
3573, 2 years ago,5,"Me encantan por ser muy economicos y ademas donde quiera cabes para estacionarte, super recomendables y mas si es standr"
3574, 2 years ago,3,Honestly have no driven it myself so I cannot judge it too much. Not the best for its price but it gets you form point A to point B. A pretty normal car. Has a good amount of space for a small car. Drives smooth.
3575,2 years ago,3,My friends mom owns this car it’s nothing special it’s just like any other family car vehicle good for trips safe for family’s it’s a decent size for traveling. I don’t have a yes or no opinion on weather or not I recommend it. It just depends on what you want to drive.
3576, 2 years ago,5,My  dad owns this car he absolutely loves it  has several back seats wich are good and  comfortable!!
3577, 2 years ago,5,Es un carro muy bueno me encanta su espacio y lo elegante y económico q es tiene muy bien motor
3578,2 years ago,5,"El confort de este carro es excepcional, el espacio es bueno, me encanta ese carro, por que es accesible."
3579,2 years ago,5,"En realidad es un carro muy bueno, tiene varias comodidades, es ideal para las familias numerosas o si no tienen muchas personas"
3580,2 years ago,5,"I don’t really like this car, too small for my children, this car keeps breaking down"
3581, 2 years ago,4,Great car by Ford for someone just starting tl drove or doesnt have kids. The car is very compact so the trunk space is at a minimum and the back seat is just as small. Carrying around a lot of things wouldnt be that great in this compact car. Its affordable but again when purchasing think about the room you will need.
3582, 2 years ago,5,So roomie love how cold it get with the ac.  So elegant and just so fancy . Gas saver and very safe. I would get this car for my kids one day for sure
3583, 2 years ago,5,"I have my 02 Ford mustang in top condition, I bought this car new, and still love it today, the only trouble I had was the brake booster going out, I've always loved ford vehicles"
3584, 2 years ago,5,I do love my car - it’s my pride and glory and I always think if I had to get rid of it I would get the same car again! It’s nice and compact which makes it easier to park and has a good size boot too.

3586,2 years ago,3,"Great car, but it feels like I'm driving a power wheel because it's so tiny, makes me feel unsafe sometimes. I hate the way the trunk opens in the side! Everything else is good. I wish they still had CD players"
3587,2 years ago,4,"I love everything about our car except one thing, the fabric they used on the seats. It is a light tan color and it shows literally every single thing that gets on it, even water!. The price of the vehicle was great, and we get amazing gas mileage, but I would definitely go with leather seats if I could do it all over again!"
3588, 2 years ago,5,The hybrid version I own is amazing. The surprising power and the gas mileage is great. The interior is made well and seems to hold up. The large touch screen and camera combo is beautiful. I recommend these cars at this price range.
3589, 2 years ago,5,"Very good, the best thing I've ever had on earthVery good, the best thing I've ever had on earth Very good, the best thing I've ever had on earthVery good, the best thing I've ever had on earthVery good, the best thing I've ever had on earthVery good, the best thing I've ever had on earth"
3590, 2 years ago,4,I love my ford focus. Ive had a few issues with it but they have all been pretty small and haven't caused huge issues. I could see myself buying this car again because I really enjoy the size and the gas milage on it. Gas isn't too expensive with it and it is a great first car.
3591, 2 years ago,5,This was a very nice car I don't remember  much about it except its alot like the ford focus. It was a very nice car it was a little more roomy than the focus.
3592, 2 years ago,5,I love my ford focus its good on gas and fast.  I'm a ford person anyway so of course I love it. The only thing I do not like about it is there is absolutely no trunk space
3593, 2 years ago,5,So good! This is one of my dream cars to buy one day! They last such a long time! They are comfortable and roomy.
3594, 2 years ago,4,Such a good car for a small fresh family. Very good with gas. Some models are surprisingly comfortable. I would only change the sound system other then that amazing.
3595, 2 years ago,5,"I have an '09 that I love.  It's falling apart now, but in it's defense it's 11 years old and has over 170,000 miles on it.  I had no serious problems until the past year when it topped the 150k mark."
3596, 2 years ago,4,"When I first got married I had a 2004 Escape. It was 3 years old. We moved 2,800 miles across the country and it held up thru sleet, snow, and rain (we moved in winter 2007). When we traded it in it had some issues, but we'd driven it all over the country beforehand!"
3597, 2 years ago,5,"Great car. I have a 2010, it is starting to get rusty on the bottom, I’m from Michigan so we get pretty snowy and salty conditions"
3598, 2 years ago,5,"This car is amazing it has Quiet interior with an easy-to-use control layout and quality materials
Optional all-wheel drive for cold-weather climates
And Adept combination of sharp handling and a composed ride. It's my favourite car!"
3599, 2 years ago,4,Very good and nice to drive and parts are cheap however find that I’ve had to buy more parts on this than my more expensive car which makes me feel they’re built cheaply and not made to last.
3600, 2 years ago,5,"It is a pretty roomy car, I drive this to go to work and school. It has a lot of compartment to store your stuff. This car is spacious which is important especially for a working student like me because I bring all my school and work things with me all the time."
3601, 2 years ago,4,"Muy placentero de manejar. Consume muy poco. No es un auto para una familia, más si para manejarlo en una gran ciudad. Su baúl ni e smuy espacioso. Es silencioso al andar. Un excelente opción para un primer auto. Cómodo definitvament. A mí me gustó."
3602, 2 years ago,4,"Cute and comfy. Nice midsize sedan. Doesn't have enough gorsepower for my taste, but is nice for the average daily driver."
3603,2 years ago,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by Ford. I thought it was only a more affordable company but the car i drove was strooooong. 
It was the Ford convertible (which I believe had been discontinue).
2.2L and leather seats. It was freaking sexy.
The seats are very comfortable and the roof is a hard roof. The car is quite long due to the roof so keep that in mind if you can't park right (im bad at parking so I have to have loads of space)"
3604, 2 years ago,5,Love this car. Have never had a problem with it. Has all the features you will ever need in a car such as Bluetooth.
3605, 2 years ago,4,We bought my daughter a used a Ford Escape when she first got her license in high school and she loved it. She drove it while she was in college for a couple years too. While I wish the vehicle had a more reliable engine (constant oil leak) it really didn’t have any big issues. She loved that she sat a little higher in it compared to a regular car. By far her favorite feature was the storage in the back! She’d have that packed when she’d come home to visit each weekend in college. Great first car - and it made her want another Ford SUV when she gets her next car.
3606, 2 years ago,4,My mother in law had one of those and now the updates for an explore and I love it .
3607, 2 years ago,3,"I have loved my little fiesta, but this car has some issues. The fuel clutch they put in it has been a nightmare. My sensors also seem to always break and I need to get them fixed. It's a great car but for those reasons I gave 3 stars. Great on gas and tiny and compact."
3608, 2 years ago,5,I love my car I'm actually  looking for the same exact car just a newer version I actually  was in an accident  with this car I was hit from behind n I love how the car absorbed the impact the way it did I totally  reccomend  this car
3609, 2 years ago,3,I used this as a rental car 🚘. I had it for a few weeks . It was pretty nice inside but I’m still sticking to Honda’s 🤍
3610, 2 years ago,5,"Adorably little hatchback, plenty of room for supplies for a weekend camping trip somewhere or a trip to the beach. Fits four adults pretty comfortably but five is a squeeze. Good cost effective car in the long run"
3611, 2 years ago,3,"Es cómoda, muy completa en accesorios y con buena seguridad para viajar en familia. También es muy cómoda, práctica para poder llegar a tu destino"
3612, 2 years ago,5,"Like the fiesta, it’s a great sedan, but this one feels more roomy inside. Has plenty of trunk space and the interior is very nice. Good price for what it is, has a decent warranty too! Seems eco friendly"
3613, 2 years ago,5,"Cute sedan, would be a good first car. Feels safe and spacious despite being a compact vehicle. Good gas mileage, drives smooth, fairly easy to maintain, and has a really good warranty with the company."
3614, 2 years ago,3,"It was a great starter car, but too many mechanical issues. Gas mileage was also great. I just don’t care for the company in general"
3615,2 years ago,5,"Super cute mid sized car,excellent on gas, rides smooth,decent size room for a small family,lot of trunk room,easy maintance!"
3616, 2 years ago,5,Great quality vehicle I own at Ford escape 2008 and I've had no issues or complaints. Great on gas family pet friendly  vehicle  reliable and spacious for road trips family shopping tow away seats for the bigger loads.
3617, 2 years ago,4,"Had a 2019 rental, it was beautiful with many bells and whistles but still the seating was a bit off and I hated the “efficient” engine"
3618, 2 years ago,5,I love love my Focus! It’s so fun and I’m thankful for it. When you first take off it acts like a manual because it is adjusting to your driving style. It’s such a cute and cool car.
3619, 2 years ago,5,"I'm pretty sure this stuff is actually magic. Over the past year, I started getting more gel manicures because I love how long they last"
3620, 2 years ago,5,I own a 2007 Ford Mustang. When the big crash came my husband and I both lost our jobs. We were still making payments at that time. We called ford and they actually deferred our payments for 9 months! That was above and beyond what we thought they were going to do and It helped us leep our car. I am a Ford person for life ;)
3621, 2 years ago,4,"I like this car, that' small and comfortable, a perfect city car. Pros: that's very cheap and absolutely not difficult to handle. I would only change the audio set. That's not an expensive car. I would anyway recommend it, absolutely yes. That's all!"
3622, 2 years ago,5,"This car is the perfect size! It's small enough that I, as a person who usually drives cars, feel comfortable driving and parking it, but large enough to fit people comfortably, a good amount of luggage, etc. My friend who drives this car puts her dog in the back and it's just enough space for her to feel comfortable!"
3623, 2 years ago,4,"I really love this car. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 star rating is because of the amount of recalls I have had since buying my car in 2015. Besides the recalls, my car has been very reliable. It drives smoothly and is easy to maintain."
3624, 2 years ago,5,"Great car for the money.  It’s a great compact size to drive, but the truck area is tiny!"
3625, 2 years ago,4,Decent car. I had a very basic 2007 Ford Focus and it was really cheap. The car made it to over 200k miles but kept having steering issues towards the end of its life which was pretty frightening. These cars slide all over the road during the winter.
3626, 2 years ago,5,I personally didn't own one but a friend has one and I've driven in it it has a smooth drive a great sound system and all the new high end gadgets to boot with gos and such. She lives it and it definitely made me consider buying one the price is decent and the Ford brand is a good company do I'd recommend any day of the week
3627, 2 years ago,5,I owned I ford f 150 Triton and lived that truck it was a v8 so had the power and dependably. We lived on a farm and used it every day to haul wood or do trash runs either way that truck was a great buy
3628, 2 years ago,5,This is the car that I learnt to drive and honestly was such a good car to do so! It was really smooth to drive and a perfect size to practice parking
3629, 2 years ago,5,Great car. Have had a few problems with it but nothing too bad. Have a few recalls as well that need to be fixed
3630, 2 years ago,5,Overall very nice car. The interior is nice and the layout of the tech is getting better and better each year
3631, 2 years ago,4,A lovely car and the perfect size for those that want a smaller car but with plenty of room for passengers and loading. A little lacking in techy side of things but overall has never caused me any problems. Handles beautifully and the upkeep is tremendously easy.
3632,2 years ago,5,"I have the 2013 Ford Escape SE. I love this car. There were a few issues that I had in the beginning, but i bought it used & I'm sure the issues were caused from the previous owners. I love the leather seats, and the big screen on the radio, the climate control & all of the features. The only thing I would change would be the color of the car itself."
3633,2 years ago,4,A nice car that isn't too noisy when driving. It handles well and is reasonably priced. It's also available in a number of different colours to suit your taste. Insurance for this car is also reasonable .
3634, 2 years ago,4,Loved our Ford Focus! It was smooth to drive and had get technology like voice activation! However it was just a bit small as our family car
3635,2 years ago,5,My mams first car that she let me behind the wheel in. Lovely car to drive and great space. Cant fault it. Good on petrol also
3636, 2 years ago,4,Its a great smaller car. I'm more on the small side. So I don't really want a big car. Enough room for me and my kids and room for groceries is good enough for me
3637, 2 years ago,3,I didn't mind my focus but it seems like every one I've owned has the same drive shaft problem. I also hated not being able to do the tune ups without taking it in.
3638, 2 years ago,4,"I'm giving my car 4 stars because I havent had it very long but I absolutely LOVE my car. It's a 2017 hybrid model. Gas mileage is AMAZING! I have a lead foot and I'm averaging 34 mpg in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. On flat terrain, I average close to 50 mpg!! Will review again in a few years so I can give an accurate account of the pros/cons."
3639, 2 years ago,5,My favorite cat it’s is extremely comfortable it’s actually very fast and it’s so beautiful inside and out if you have a black one and tint the windows wow so nice.... I can say that I love my car
3640, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car! It's cute and little and gets great gas mileage. The trunk is huge. So much space! You can change the colors of some of the lights inside, it's awesome."
3641, 2 years ago,1,Awful car! It broke down alot.shortly a few months after getting the car. Its ment more for driving to and from store  and home. Not a family car at all
3642, 2 years ago,3,Drives pretty good! Not my first choice for a car! It does it's job to get you to and from places! Any car is better than no car right!? Only driven a handle of times!
3643, 2 years ago,5,I really love my vehicle. It’s practical and fits my kids car seats. I would have liked something a little bigger but I couldn’t pass up the price. My only complaint is I’ve had a lot of issues with my electrical and touch screen
3644, 2 years ago,3,"I have a few family members who drive a Ford focus, they loved it in the beginning and then started to have a love-hate relationship with it because it Became very problematic and Ford wasn’t really able to help them, cute car but very problematic"
3645, 2 years ago,3,"I love my SUV! I named him Vibranium lol, (smoke gray) this car gets great gas milage, smooth ride. You can let The back seats down for extra storage space. There are a ton of options to keep your devices charged. However, the issues I'm having is my fan keep going in and out which helps keeps the engine cool. And I have to keep replacing the front 2 tires, I do a lot of traveling. Other than that is is the cutest car and affordable."
3646, 2 years ago,5,I always get good service at FORD dealership. I take my husband's F-150 every few months for tire rotation and oil change and get great customer service.
3647, 2 years ago,5,"I loved my ford Focus,  it a very good running car and it got great gas mileage! It was fun to drive and it was actually very roomy."
3648, 2 years ago,3,"I loved my little 06 Ford Focus. I don't know about anything before or past that year but we got a good 350k miles our of her before she went! It was good. Lots of room, 3rd person in front (seats 6), it got from a lot of point A's to a lot of point B's and back my friend! 06 was my year!"
3649,2 years ago,5,"It is very comfortable, good brand a cargo, good engine and economic, it has a long life and does not breaky easily"
3650, 2 years ago,2,"I have a 2012 Ford Focus that I purchased with a little over 8,000 miles on it. This car had major transmission problems over the years, which I have attempted to get resolved by the Ford dealership multiple times. I would not recommend this car to anyone, and I plan on trading it in now that its paid off!!!"
3651, 2 years ago,5,I have heard alot about this car and it's superb features. It's so comfortable and any middle class person can buy this. I have never used a car but i have heard a lot about it. Also it's not that expensive. If you need a car...i would recomment ford company's !
3652, 2 years ago,5,"great car, great amount of space, great on gas. maintenance is minimal as well. i have never owned one, but i know people who have and they love it."
3653, 2 years ago,4,"I prefer a vehicle with a bit more size to it.  It’s sporty appearance is giving me reason to look a bit closer...
It is actually roomy in the backseats!
I wouldn’t want to carpool the kids to school, but I can see a couple of co-workers relaxing in that back seat. When I look long and hard at the little car, I find the word ‘fun’ pushing into my thoughts. I am ready to find another Ford dealership so that we ca test-drive it, too. It is classy looking, too, but it’s so cute.  Yes!  Cute and classy just what every teenage girl dreams of."
3654, 2 years ago,5,"It is looking like it’s undercover. I can tell the vehicle is athletic by the way it’s turned it’s head away from me - like it could be gone in a second.  It looks expensive, but I think that’s a plus.  Makes the driver beguiling - after all the vehicle is a real pleasant eye - catcher.  Wow! Didn’t someone say once that you can’t buy real ‘class’?  Watching that classy machine go down the highway makes it difficult to stay away from the dealership, but, if we just take it for a test - drive maybe that will dim it’s draw on me......not!   😍 That’s a Ford❣️"
3655, 2 years ago,4,Ik vind dit een mooi model van Ford. Ook het interieur binnenin heeft alle comfort en ziet er luxueus uit. Verschillende opties waardoor de autorit nog gemakkelijker is!
3656, 2 years ago,5,"My current car. I have a 2012 and she is stunning. Great mileage, comfortable interior and I got it for a low low price because I have connections. Not everyone can say that! I hope she lasts a long time."
3657, 2 years ago,5,I had my 2006 Ford Focus station wagon for 6 years. It served me well. It did not have bells and whistles but had plenty of storage room and kept me safe as a daily driver and on many vacation drives.
3658, 2 years ago,4,"Runs well, rides smoothly, maintenance is affordable and looks nice. The trunk and back seat are spacious"
3659, 2 years ago,3,one of my friends has this car. it is very good for family. it has lot of space to carry luggage.
3660, 2 years ago,4,"I rented this vehicle make and model after wrecking my minivan and I really enjoyed driving it. Pros, it fit 2 adults and 3 children in car seats comfortably, it drove and handled well, it had plenty of power to get me on the interstate and preformed great through stop and go traffic in the city, minimal road noise. Cons, we have pets and it wasn't as pet friendly as my minivan when it came to getting to the crates and getting them in and out. Kids had to climb on seats to get in and out as well so not as practical as I would look for in a purchase."
3661,2 years ago,5,I really loved my Ford Escape for the short while I had it. The truck worked great for many years without any issues ; but eventually the wear and tear caught up. I would consider buying one again. A great family car.
3662, 2 years ago,5,"Great car. Small. Wouldn't be a good car for carseats. But it's a great car for a teenager, young adult. Decent gas milage. I would choose this car again. Great on the highway. Good in town. It's a perfect ""first car."" Sporty for a car it's size."
3663, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car. It is exactly what I needed. My boyfriend has a Corvette and a Mustang so we needed a car that we could use to fit more in when shopping, traveling and running errands. I didn't get the navigation system and don't really see a need for it since my phone works well on a mount. I got this car for a great price and would highly recommend it to other people looking at this or similar vehicles."
3664, 2 years ago,5,When I first got it I didn't really know what to thing of it since my mom had picked it out (I was a teenager) but it grew to love it cuz of the speakers it had. Super laud and crisp music. Had a bluetooth audio witch was a most have since I have having cables go everywhere.
3665, 2 years ago,4,"Well my friend has this car,  She has used it for a year now and she is very happy with it, the only issues was the brakes for some reason it would make sounds even though the car is not that old so yeah she had to go the mechanics to fix that plus she changed the inside design a bit ....it was pretty expensive but It looks really good and better than how it was (it looked awesome already ) .I would recommend it."
3666, 2 years ago,5,The Ford Focus is a good car! I think it gets good mileage and it isn’t too big or anything
3667, 2 years ago,5,I really like this care because it has several cool features like a camera and Bluetooth. It drives smoothly which is something I always look for in a car. I would improve the hight because I think it is too low to the ground. Overall I would recommend. 
3668, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car. It’s good on gas when it comes to an SUV and it’s reliable. I drive on a daily basis and I love how dependable this car has been for me. The features are also nice, including the stereo and sunroof"
3669, 2 years ago,3,My mom had one and I believe I got one as a rental. This is a no frills SUV. It’s pretty reliable - not too compact but not too big. Perfect for driving around a big city but able to take it out on outdoor adventures.
3670, 2 years ago,4,So basically I was just a passenger by I notice the car run smooth and I can tell it had a good engine !!
3671, 2 years ago,5,This car is so small I could fit anywhere. Gas is real good. I had a Ford Focus for 3 years and enjoyed it. It was the car I learned to drive in.
3672, 2 years ago,5,I love my Ford Escape. It’s the perfect size for me to feel comfortable driving and fit everything I need in it!
3673, 2 years ago,3,I liked this vehicle we had for awhile but it was bought used and paid to much it wasn't nothing special traded it in later.
3674, 2 years ago,3,It rode nice and felt safe. I liked how there were compartments in the console area.
3675, 2 years ago,5,"I had this as a rental and I gotta say it’s a great sedan with some extras. You can get a basic no frills model or one with a few luxuries. Drives smoothly! If I weren’t into trucks, and just need a basic car that’s not too cramped and not too huge I’d go with this one."
3676, 2 years ago,4,I like my Ford Fusion. It is a 2012 and has had very little issues. It drives smoothly and is definitely a reliable vehicle.
3677, 2 years ago,5,This was my first car and I miss it . It is nice for beginners. It is perfect I loved everything about it!!
3678, 2 years ago,4,It’s fun to drive. It’s fully loaded with a sunroof. Should get better gas mileage for it’s size.
3679, 2 years ago,3,"My partner love this car. It’s small, gets decent gas mileage, and is a stick. I give it three stars because it’s small, it only gets decent gas mileage, and it’s a stick. The awesome thing about this car is that it has a no roll clutch. We live on a hill and the car never rolls...awesome!"
3680, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2013 Ford Fusion and I love it! It gets great gas mileage. I typically drive around suburbia and sometime in a downtown area. This car gets around great! I am in my car for work all of the time so I need a reliable car like this, plus it’s sporty too, I love the electric blue exterior, sun roof and black interior!"
3681, 2 years ago,5,My favorite brand...!!!! love this car in black color so so beautiful.....!!!!!!!!😍 🤩
3682, 2 years ago,5,"This car is beautiful and very spacious. In addition to the fact that the changes are automatic. It can be used for family trips, but not everyone can buy it because it is expensive."
3683, 2 years ago,5,"I love my vehicle roomy, has a spacious trunk for groceries. Enough space for my kiddos and I. Love how my windows are tinted, how well it drives."
3684, 2 years ago,5,"Love this car it’s super user friendly, super cute, and has amazing gas millage. It also has a lot of room in the car but doesn’t feel like a huge car. This car is perfect for college students are young married couples or even first or second time parents."
3685,2 years ago,5,"I used to have the Ford Fusion hybrid and absolutely loved it, the gas mileage was FANTASTIC. I could sometimes get 60 miles to the gallon! Would totally recommend to anyone looking into getting a hybrid"
3686,2 years ago,5,"I have the hybrid and absolutely love it! It is spacious, comfortable, and gets great gas mileage, which is all I could ask for out of a vehicle. I would recommend this car to anyone who is thinking of getting a hybrid"
3687,2 years ago,5,"The best machine. It is not always necessary to follow fashion and drive only lexus or bmw. This machine is very convenient especially when traveling. Stable on the road, does not break at all, has never been a car service in 2 years. Menvringa and very beautiful"
3688, 2 years ago,5,"I upgraded from a focus to an escape and I am happy with the upgrade.  Its been a very reliable car so far.  I drive a lot for work and when there is lots of snow I feel a lot safer in this vehicle.  Its a comfy ride too.  The cost, well we pay more for upgrades.  My only issue has been the connectivity to my Android and a few Bluetooth issues that is primarily just an upgrade issue.  9ther than that - extremely satisfied!"
3689, 2 years ago,4,"Loved my Ford focus hatchback!  I had a manual Titanium and had so much fun driving it.  It was great on gas and I found it comfy.  Amazingly I could haul quite a bit with the hatchback which was a bonus.  The only cons would be that my husband, who is 6'5"", needed a little more room and if my roads weren't plowed it was a little tricky getting moving."
3690, 2 years ago,5,This car had a very smooth drive. very good on gas. i felt very safe when driving around. I would consider purchasing this car as my next car. 
3691, 2 years ago,5,It is such a good car that i know i can reply on it! i haven't had any problems with it and the dealership always have the answers if i were to have any questions. very smooth drive.

3700, 2 years ago,3,"The dealership was great. The car was alittle unreliable! During my ownership for the most part it worked, but small things just showed me it was a cheap car. It’s affordable though so I suppose that’s the point."
3701, 2 years ago,4,Good car model need to be improved have great colours in it been using it a while now
3702, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car. Its practical, sporty, and has value. I love how it handles when I drive and is not too sensitive in the steering or the acceleration/braking"
3703, 2 years ago,5,"Best car I have ever owned! I have a 2018, bought it brand new and have had it for 2 years and already put 30,000 miles on it! Has been the best car I’ve ever had!"
3704, 2 years ago,5,"My aunt owns one. Very comfortable ride, cool design. Up to date on technology. Plenty of color options."
3705, 2 years ago,4,"It has a great predicted reliability rating, a spacious interior, and engaging performance, but its middling interior quality keeps it from being a class leader."
3706, 2 years ago,2,2012 was not a good vehicle for me! Issues with the trans. Come to find out Ford is in a lawsuit for these issues. 2012-2016 I believe are the models with these problems. Get yours checked out and be safe. The vehicle can stall in middle of traffic for no reason. So far not a great experience with Ford regarding the issue either.
3707, 2 years ago,3,"We just bought our son a Ford Focus, 2003.  For being that old, it is in really good shape, and was surprised at how smooth the ride felt.  It has really held up well over the years, and was given the green light by our mechanic."
3708, 2 years ago,4,"Belle voiture , spacieuse et agréable à conduire mais consomme quand meme beaucoup..."
3709, 2 years ago,5,I love my car so much. I like the way it looks. And it also gets very good gas mileage. Also very roomy and realist for everyday use. Highly recommend.
3710, 2 years ago,4,Ford is my kind of vehicle! This newer escape is set up weird in the inside I prefer my 2012 escape much better.
3711,2 years ago,5,"Love this car! It ol has great mileage, however it is fairly small and does not work great if you are planning to travel with people. Love the colors included in the car as well as the Bluetooth."
3712,2 years ago,3,I've only driven a Ford Focus when I took Driver's Ed. I remember feeling safe and secure in it. It was a good size and comfortable. The things I didn't like was the steering was stiff and it wasn't the smoothest ride. Definitely good for beginners though.
3713, 2 years ago,5,Love it! Just like my Ford Fiesta it was great ok gas and great in the snow perfect amount of room for me and my two babies! ￼
3714, 2 years ago,5,Loved how good it was on gas! It was a perfect starter car! It was great in the snow for being front wheel drive!
3715, 2 years ago,2,I had nothing but problems with my Ford Escape. Not to mention the terrible trade in value. I’d think twice before investing money into a Ford.
3716, 2 years ago,5,This was the first time to drive for me in this car it was a really good experience for me and I really appreciate
3717, 2 years ago,2,"Ford, in my family, stands for “Fix or repair daily”. I had an old ford escape as my first car and it was always needing something fixed. On the other end, our family car is also a ford escape. But it’s older and an XL and honestly works great. I guess they just vary?"
3718, 2 years ago,5,"I love a hatchback and my focus just makes me happy. The size is perfect for me, my husband, and occasionally our dog. We don’t have to worry about gas mileage (because we get over 30 mpg!) and can easily drive through the city because we aren’t in an oversized suv. Highly recommend the Focus!"
3719, 2 years ago,3,We had just the standard Ford Focus and wasn’t very impressed. This is a good company work car. I don’t think it drove smooth. Seemed to company feel. It’s fairly affordable but again not a family car. Would be perfect for companies.
3720, 2 years ago,4,"Generally like this car. It was my first car ever and ran well. It has been in the family for 16 years. Of those years it had broken down, but was easily fixed. I had no issues or complaints while driving it when I did. However, more recent it can’t take the heat. If it’s out too long in the heat, then it likes to break down."
3721, 2 years ago,5,Wonderful car it's got all kinds of extra and stuff. It not to bad for my first new new car. It was affordable and has been depemdable. Just don't loose your key you have to let them tow it to the dealer ship and it's very exspensive
3722, 2 years ago,5,"This product company is really great... Durable and not to expensive at all. Not like European cars
Its really great car company"
3723, 2 years ago,5,"This product company is really great... Durable and not to expensive at all. Not like European cars
Its really great car company"
3724, 2 years ago,5,This product company is really great... Durable and not to expensive at all. Not like European cars...
3725, 2 years ago,4,"Ford is an ok vehicle. Good overall value for an SUV. Great mileage, nicely priced. SUVs sre great for traveling and hauling. Would recommend."
3726, 2 years ago,5,It is so comfortable. I like the interior of this car and the colors that are available. Also a good car for beginners
3727, 2 years ago,5,It is so comfortable. I like the interior of this car and the colors that are available. Also a good car for beginners
3728,2 years ago,3,This car is very small to begin with and then they make the dash larger than it needs to be and takes up extra room. I had this car a few years and had to have it worked on a few times due to recalls. It does get incredible gas mileage and if your ok with a small space then it is comfortable to ride in.
3729, 2 years ago,4,"I drove my grandmother's ford and it was nice, it is a brandnew ford escape has all the bells and whistles or fully loaded which is a luxury but I prefer my older models (less expensive to fix) and they were built to last. Also I am a chevy, GMC kinda girl."
3730, 2 years ago,3,"Smaller than my current Honda Accord and previous Mercury Milan. Basically a small car that appears to be bigger. But less space for legs in front seats, non-existent leg space in the back seats and storage in back isn't wide enough. It is not my style car and don't like the tight squeeze especially for bigger car. But it handles well and was a smooth ride."
3731,2 years ago,5,"Absolutely love my Ford Fiesta ST line. I find it cheap to run, with the low road tax and 1.0l engine, whilst also being a quick car!"
3732, 2 years ago,4,Sitting in the passenger seat it feels like a very smooth ride. I think it was just the person driving the car. 
3733, 2 years ago,4,"I own a 2010 escape. This vehicle does everything that I need it to as I drive daily and the gas mileage is good. I have had to replace a few parts which is understandable with it being over 200,000 miles. The only issue I would have would be the transmission slipping."
3734, 2 years ago,5,rented this car on a trip to ohio with my friends and it was the best! Drives smoothly and only had to stop to get gas at least 3 or 4 times throughout the entire trip which was for 3 days.
3735, 2 years ago,5,This was my first car and for a first car it was great! Especially on gas a a broke high school students and wallet. I had the 2009 white Ford Focus and it will forever be cherished.
3736, 2 years ago,5,I enjoy driving my Escape. It’s economical but I don’t like the outside noise. I also wish it drove a little more smoother.
3737, 2 years ago,4,Not a huge fan of the focus although it's bigger than a fiesta. It's a great budget car however if you want something compact with a similar feel go for a fiesta. It fits into tint parkings with easy and manages well long distance driving. However none of these models are good to off road. Fiesta lacks Bluetooth connection in the basic model.
3738, 2 years ago,4,Since Ford edge wasn't listed I'm going to write about it here! While escape is a decent model I prefer edge because it has plenty of space and escape kind of compromises that you can tell from the interior of the car. I absolutely love my edge it's so comfortable no crazy maintenance issues the sound and lighting it just perfect. It picks up speed quickly.
3739, 2 years ago,4,I absolutely love Fors vehicles. I currently own an f150 and it was my very first truck. I love being higher up than with a car.
3740, 2 years ago,4,The Ford focus is a great starter car for teenagers. It has great safety ratings but is also super stylish.  The only drawback is it's not very spacious.
3741, 2 years ago,5,Love this car it has a smooth and nice ride to which I absolutely love and would recommend too other people to buy it has five seats which is good for the family of this kind also it is easy to drive and has gives Ik stress
3742, 2 years ago,5,Such a neat car! 100% recommend to any family driver that is all about the ECO life! It's so efficient on gas and has lots of comfortable room inside. I would say it's very affordable for everything you get and it has been very dependable to me and my family!
3743,2 years ago,2,"Je n'aime pas du tout ce modèle mais pour une famille c'est le genre de voiture qu'il faut , grand espace est son avantage,  lent est son inconvénient"
3744, 2 years ago,3,The car was maybe a 2000. As a passenger it was small. I'm tall so not a whole lot of leg space. It is great on gas though. Be careful taking off it speeds up quick!
3745, 2 years ago,5,"Smooth ride, very nice interior. I like that it is roomy inside even though it looks like a small car. The car seems reliable and the stereo system works well."
3746, 2 years ago,4,"2015, Sedan

I love this little car.  It is great on gas! Fits 4/5 comfortably, huge trunk for a sedan, many options to make sure the driver is comfortable and the audio system is great! The seat heaters work amazingly, wipers have many speeds and the washer fluid comes out in a ￼wide spray. All options are conveniently located for driver convenient."
3747,2 years ago,5,Have Ford F-150 and I love my truck. Would never drive anything but a ford. No one in my house does
3748,2 years ago,3,"Smooth ride, Medium Gas Mileage, uncomfortable seats, I was not impressed with the Focus. If I had to get another Ford it would not be a Ford Focus. However, I do like the Aerostar and Windstar so I would be willing to try another Ford Minivan. I am also looking into purchasing a Ford Truck in the future."
3749, 2 years ago,5,"Ford isn't a ""1st Choice"" these days given their history for having their gas tanks blow up due to poorly location, later improved with drawstring pulls, but I love them! Despite the negative history, they are friggin' expensively priced based on their competition. I'd rec' it though!  I love the spacious, smooth ride and the amenities are sweet as well!"
3750, 2 years ago,5,We have a Ford Fusion hybrid and between the gas mileage and lack of need for repairs overall it has been a great car. It does have tire sensors that conveniently all had to be replaced within months of each other but being that the car is ten years old this year that is not a huge complaint and to be expected as the sensor are battery operated. Other than that a great car for us and our three large furkids.
3751, 2 years ago,4,Great car. Love the interior and how easily I can connect to things. Interior is also spacious. Great fuel mileage
3752, 2 years ago,4,It’s a nice car a small suv. Always is a nice ride and a reliable car. Pretty popular
3753, 2 years ago,5,"We had this as a rental car and it had all the bells and whistles. My husband and I fought over who got to drive it. It was smooth, easy to handle, amazing. If we could afford to get an SUV right now, it would definitely be this one. I don't know how high maintenance it is so that would be my only hold up."
3754, 2 years ago,4,My friend recently bought this car and I rode in it with her. It's a really nice car. I almost bought one myself when we were car shopping. I love the motion sensor trunk feature as a mom. It really comes in handy. It's very spacious. Very smoothe ride!
3755, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford fusion. Best car I have ever bought hands down. I love all of the features that it comes with as well as how it drives so smoothly. The only thing I would improve is to make the child seat harnesses a little more accessible, as they are rather deep under the seats. 
Other than that highly recommended!"
3756, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. I’ve had mine since 2008 and it’s still running strong. Never want to get rid of it honestly. Love love love
3757, 2 years ago,5,This car is absolutely beautiful. It is very nice looking and luxurious! The 2020 model is amazing. I have no improvements so far. It is pretty much the same price as others like it. I would totally recommend!!!!
3758, 2 years ago,5,Really rides nice and whips around easy. Definitely would recommend for someone looking for a suv.
3759,2 years ago,5,"I've always loved import cars and suvs, but after buying my first Ford this past September, I must say I don't believe there is room for any other make going forward.

3760, 2 years ago,5,My husband currently has a Ford truck. We love it. It is very very spacious on the instead. It is our most comfortable vehicle because with two kids which means to car seats we still fit and with lots of room. It is a comfortable truck. The only down side for me it is that since it is a long bead it is way to long. I hate having to drive it cause I feel like it is a huge monster lol.
3761,2 years ago,5,I loved this car as my everyday source of travel I felt that it rose very smoothly and overall just was a very great car.
3762, 2 years ago,4,pretty good actually it’s a very smooth ride and i love it personally there’s nothing bad about it honestly i just reallt love the way it feels when u drive and i would recommend to new drivers
3763, 2 years ago,5,"It is actually my brother's and I use it a few times a week, I really like to handle it because I feel super comfortable and safe."
3764,2 years ago,5,"I have a ford fiesta from 1996, he is older than me!! But this baby can move!!! The chiftes are great and even though it's an older car hasn't given me any major problems."
3765, 2 years ago,5,Very nicely done car! I love these!! Maybe one day I could have my own. It’s a good crossover
3766,2 years ago,5,I love this car. It is very smooth to ride in and I don’t really have any complaints. It has so far been my favorite car that I have ever driven.
3767, 2 years ago,5,"I drive a 2009, super dependable. There is plenty of space for me and my four chilldren. Even after a days worth of shopping. It is great on gas. I did struggle when I had 3 children in car seats"
3768, 2 years ago,5,My mom had almost all the new fords that came out and this one was honestly my favorite
3769, 2 years ago,5,"Great car for the whole family , seats everyone including the dog, one thing I’ve always loved about fords is that their cars literally last forever that’s why is such a perfect car for the family. I highly recommend"
3770, 2 years ago,4,I liked how fast this car was and it is pretty nice looking but it did have some problems that needed to be fixed.
3771, 2 years ago,5,Idk why but I have always lived these cars idk if there good to own I've always had hindas and Toyota I had a f150 this car just always made me feel good to drive tho idk lol
3772, 2 years ago,4,They drive very nice. I didn’t like the layout of the vehicle but it had a lot of room.
3773, 2 years ago,5,"I have a Ford Mustang so I am a hands down fan of Ford.  Nicely built, pretty to look at.  A pure powerhouse.  A win, win in my book."
3774, 2 years ago,4,"I havent had it for long but so far so good. I have had 2 other Ford products both were Taurus. I love the ease of handling,the dependability of Fords."
3775, 2 years ago,5,I have a 1999 Ford Expedition and it's great for my Family of 8 I also use my truck to load up when we go to the lake for some family fun In the sun
3776, 2 years ago,4,I bought this for my fiancé about 3 years ago and he loves it. It’s a good car there are some down sides to it’s durability on its physical appearance. The inside and outside of the car scratches up very very easily but other than that it’s a great car with good gas milage.
3777, 2 years ago,2,"Bought a Ford Escape, and traded it in 2 months later. Hated it. To small, compact and just not my kind of car. I traded it in for a Hummer H3 and love that. I feel the price point on an Escape is ok, and maybe if you like a small SUV, but I am into a bigger vehicle."
3778,2 years ago,5,This car is good on gas and reliable. It is comfortable and drives well. It is very fuel efficient and very nice overall
3779, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. I had a 1998 Ford and when I upgrade to my 2011 fusion I understood why I loved Ford so much. It’s comparable to a new car for a cheaper price and has all the features anyone could need
3780, 2 years ago,4,"I really like the look of the Ford Fusion. It has a great feel, it is sporty and fun! It is also great to drive but I was not thrilled with some of the interior finishes. I do feel that there could have been a little more detail put into the finishes in order to make it feel a bit more polished and sporty. "
3781, 2 years ago,5,I had a Ford Focus in the past and it was my first car. It was a perfect car for a first time driver. It was small and super easy to drive and also it was pretty good on gas. I got mine used so it was pretty affordable and I would recommend this car to any new driver.
3782,2 years ago,4,The breaks were a little off in this car but everything else is great. Very clean and nice looking
3783, 2 years ago,5,I love this car I wish it was my car haha but nothing bad about this car. I don’t think you could improve this car unless you make it mine haha.
3784, 2 years ago,3,This was the first car I bought and i had nothing but issues out of it. Would not recommend a newer model. The older models are a lot better. Would not purchase one again. Went to Nissan and fell in love there.
3785, 2 years ago,4,The Ford Escape offers a really premium package for a reasonable price. Perfect for a passenger like me who doesn't like to drive. 
3786,2 years ago,4,"I found myself very comfortable with this car, it's in the 4th place on best selling.
Has a nice gps touchscreen, really useful. Helps you to filter the traffic average. I have it in grey and it's beautiful
I would recommend this car, it's quite affordable."
3787, 2 years ago,5,This car is incredible for the cost value. I traded in my BMW X5 and got the escape brand new at 0% financing through Ford. Incredible and had almost as many options as my overpriced and overmaintained BMW. Highly recommend this all wheel drive grocery getter for winter climates.
3788, 2 years ago,5,"if you keep the car clean and healthy it will honestly last you forever, my mom owns this car and its great"
3789,2 years ago,5,"My first car so is my treasure, my little investment actually my first big investment , so proud of that

 In my earlie 20's I bought my own car with my own hard worked money , at my part time job because I was also in college at that time  . My ford was a second hand car from 2008 , it worked great for me , had no major issues , and I still have it at my parents house since I couldn't get rid of it .. too much emotional value"
3790, 2 years ago,3,"Maybe the new ones are good, but my family got a 2009 and the thing was in sorry shape. It sounded hollow when we hit bumps, and the transmission never worked, even after replacement. Not worth it"
3791, 2 years ago,5,This was my favorite car I ever owned. I had a Ford Focus and beat the thing to hell and back but it still ran like a champ. I miss that car. Cheap to fix and get parts for too
3792, 2 years ago,4,Great car! Very dependable! The parts are not unreasonable to replace or update and the mileage is great. The 2009 version has the same rust spot in every car but they seem to have fixed that on the newer models.
3793, 2 years ago,5,love this care i had the 2012 ford escape and 8 years late it’s still running like new
3794,2 years ago,5,I had a 2011 Ford Fusion for seven years. I didn't have to change anything by the tires and batteries on it. The brakes was changed out in 2018 but had to buy a new car because of a accident. I love my Ford because of the performance and overall excellent product.
3795, 2 years ago,5,I have had this car for a long time and it still hasn't broken or something happened to it.  It is my favorite car.  I always take it with me because I need it and I
3796, 2 years ago,1,Very u comftable looks really ugly and don’t like the brand overalls much better cars out there
3797, 2 years ago,2,I have never been a fan of Ford. My sister & her husband both had Ford focuses and both of them gave them a lot of problems.
3798,2 years ago,4,Ford explorer I have is a good car and is easy to maintain and lasts a long time so durable and if it breaks down easy to fix pretty quickly
3799, 2 years ago,3,"My car is from 2005 of 2006 I don’t remember. It is a nice car, and drives well, but it is old, and have had a few adjustments so far. I bought it used, and it is still a nice car to drive, even though it is so old."
3800, 2 years ago,4,"It is a very good brand, it is very light and has a good speed. I hate the fact it is bit too small but I really liked the fact that I save a lot on petrol because it doesn't use much. It is an very affordable first car. I would love it if it were bigger. I would definitely recommend it"
3801, 2 years ago,5,It was a very pretty/simple luxury type car that is perfect for daily use while still looking sporty. It drives really smooth and is super comfortable and easy to navigate! This car brand makes me more interested in owning this type of car in the future.
3802, 2 years ago,3,I like the newer models much more than the older models. The backseat is a nice size but still feels much more compact than the older models.
3803, 2 years ago,2,"This was probably the most problematic vehicle I’ve ever driven. As far as model years, I don’t believe there’s much difference between old and new. The Focus is cheaply built and cheaply maintained. The dash/console is outdated-looking and the vehicle itself barely has any resale value. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it has excellent gas mileage and would be a simple vehicle for newbie drivers."
3804, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape 2017! Reliable, I always feel safe in my SUV, especially in the winter. I can safely get to an from work safely in pretty much any meteorological conditions. It was relatively affordable, and I don't regret my choice of vehicle."
3805, 2 years ago,5,This car is amazing! It is almost the perfect smaller hatchback car. The top spec ones include heated seats steering wheel and CarPlay etc and for a smaller car they are very roomy for passengers and have plenty of boot space!
3806, 2 years ago,5,This car is amazing! It is almost the perfect hatchback car. The top spec ones include heated seats steering wheel and CarPlay etc and for a standard hatchback car they are very roomy for passengers and have plenty of boot space!
3807, 2 years ago,4,"Recent generations have been touted as the best-handling car in the small car class,
earning the Ford Fiesta a solid reputation for driver appeal. There are also some fine engines to choose from, too, the most noteworthy of which are the 1.0-litre turbocharged Ecoboost units that come in a variety of power
outputs."
3808, 2 years ago,4,Nice car they’re always changing becoming more modern and comfortable but these die run a little bit with some maintenance issues they often have to be looked at and well I don’t think it’s the best investment but nice to ride in .
3809, 2 years ago,5,These cars are nice. The newer models go pretty fast and ride very smoothly. Great audio system
3810, 2 years ago,1,Not a fan of Ford cars as every single one I've ever owned had a lot of issues that were not my fault and I find them hard to work on as I like to do my own repairs when the car needs it.
3811, 2 years ago,2,Too tiny and lightweight. Hydroplaning is easy to do. The cute colored interior lights are festive. For a 13 year old girl.
3812, 2 years ago,5,Best first time car. reliable and fuel efficient. The FORD Focus has a special place in my memories. Unfortunately had to trade it in as the family grew.
3813,2 years ago,3,Not a bad car but it was not what I was expecting.  Quiet hard to get parts for and had trouble finding a mechanic.
3814, 2 years ago,5,"No puedo decir nada del producto nunca he manejado uno, pero como pasajero me gusto la comodidad"
3815, 2 years ago,4,"Such a good car for beginners or experts. Very good technology on the inside, feels like a very luxurious car even though it’s very affordable and great on gas. It is also very spacious on the inside and the seats are also very comfortable. The only thing I can complain about this car is that the version that I have has a lot of recalls."
3816, 2 years ago,2,We have a 2013 and and have put over $5000 into in the past 3 years....Never will i recommend this car to anyone
3817, 2 years ago,5,This car is great if you want to save money on gas to get to and from work. It is quiet and works great. It just isn’t the best if you want to load up your car to travel
3818, 2 years ago,5,"I recently upgraded to a suv due to having two kids under two and I absolutely love my car! It’s roomy, it’s comfortable, the only downside is my double stroller barley fits in the trunk. I would recommend this car two anyone who has two children!"
3819, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my 2018 Ford Escape! When i was test driving i thought it was way too small and wasn’t for me. When i went back to test drive and found one with heated seats i fell in love. It’s the perfect size for me, my boyfriends, and our dogs."
3820, 2 years ago,4,We have Ford Escape for about 2 years now. I like that it allows us to travel to the mountains and gravel roads. But the windshield sits in that position when all the bugs stick to it during summer and it’s hard to clean that out. But other than that it’s a good car!
3821, 2 years ago,5,I’ve been in love with my 2014 Escape Titanium since my first test drive. It had all of the bells and whistles I wanted in a car for my set budget. No other small SUV had that amount of features for the price. It’s pure luxury!
3822, 2 years ago,5,"I’ve been a ford driver for about 6 years now and honestly best and most reliable make of car out there. I’ve had my escape for about a year now and just upgraded to the titanium version of it. Best. Car. Ever. I wanted something bigger than my focus, but smaller than the explorer and this is the PERFECT in between. It’s got heated seats, a sun roof, a touch screen with backup cam and parking sensors. All around the best. <3"
3823, 2 years ago,5,"Its so great model! Mine is manual, 2016 Y. Motor is economic, the salon good for family and couple using.  Ford Focus"
3824, 2 years ago,3,"I love the car itself, I have the 2018. But I have had multiple recalls already, including a computer reset, engine rebuild, and other engine parts replacements. It’s barely a year old. I bought it brand new. It poses me off to have bought a brand new car and already have so many problems. But the set up of the car itself is great."
3825, 2 years ago,4,"Went for the Titanium package, primarily because I can't afford to go fully electric yet and this has eco boost. Unfortunately, I still pay way too much for gas,averaging 26 mpg. Overall, it's a comfortable ride.  Ford Motor Company"
3826, 2 years ago,4,Love my car I am a ford girl so I will forever love this brand .... Um they really solid and my car is my baby
3827, 2 years ago,5,"I bought the 2014 Ford Fusion EcoBoost to commute back and forth from work about an hour each day. This car is spacious, has a modern look and has hasn’t let us down yet. It costs about $30-$40 to fill up with fuel which isn’t bad."
3828, 2 years ago,4,"I love love love my car!!! Everything about it I love, except the fact the seats look so dirty all the time and are hard to clean"
3829, 2 years ago,5,You can always make a mustang unique and different from the rest. Any mod looks good and is worth doing. Have owned it for 2 years and it’s super reliable and fun to drive. Best first car for anyone and I highly recommended buying one!!
3830, 2 years ago,2,"Worst car.. So many little things on it would break.. Door handles, heated seats, windows going up, AC.. and major things like the engine over heating and fuel injectors needing replaced"
3831,2 years ago,5,"Excellent car, it is useful and comfortable to go everywhere, in addition to that it is beautiful Everything works wonderfully, I bought it with a lot of effort but it is totally worth having it, it has been so useful to me, I love its interior, it looks very good as well as its exterior and the color is very nice
If you are looking for a car, I recommend you 100%, I love it❤😍😍😍😍"
3832, 2 years ago,3,My husband purchased this without me. I was quite upset. Fords have very manly interiors and seem cheaply made. I prefer his built in gps to the one in my vehicle but overall the seats are uncomfortable and many features are failing too quickly. I expect better from this brand as I was hoping to buy a Mustang.
3833, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my Ford Fiesta 2016. For some it may be small, but for me it's perfect. It drives smooth and saves me lots of money on gas. Something that would need a little bit of improvement would be the radio system. Also, being able to connect my phone to the car could be a little bit challenging at times."
3834, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car, my partner has this and it is super spacious and has tons of room in boat and is really comfy leaving plenty of room for when we have kids. And when we go shopping. Great car if you do lots of travelling as really comfy"
3835, 2 years ago,5,"Its the best guys I would like to use it on my prome party and take out my girl friend awesome even my friends will like it I think that its the best try it 
Its affordable at low priced and good comfortable I recommend that guys you try it course ford is always the bestFord Fusion "
3836, 2 years ago,5,"Nice car. I like the interior design as well. Its my father in laws car, its huge compared to what I own but once you behind the wheel you feel like you own the road lol"
3837, 2 years ago,5,"It is a wonderful uto, it has a charming design, I like it very much, I would not change anything and it is very comfortable"
3838, 2 years ago,4,I’ve driven 2 focus and both were decent basic vehicles.  Reliable but not anything to fall in love with.
3839, 2 years ago,4,"I've driven and also been a passenger in it it's nice and okay. It does have a smooth ride but it's just not for me because I'm a tall person and it still feels like I'm riding low to the ground, which is the reason why I drive a much larger vehicle but other than that I recommend this vehicle to anybody looking for a crossover type of body style it's just not for me but if I have to drive it while then I have to drive it."
3840, 2 years ago,5,"This is a perfect first car! I’ve been having my Ford Focus for about 3 years so far and I hardly ever have any troubles with it. It has decent gas mileage and I don’t have to pay a lot of money for gas every week. It’s a small car but it’s not as cramped on the inside. I haven’t had to do any repairs on it yet but even if I do, they would not be expensive repairs compared to other vehicles."
3841, 2 years ago,5,I’ve had two in the past and I love it! The only thing is there has been a peice of the car on the underside that has came off on both cars. This needs to be fixed. But it gets good fuel and I take car of them.
3842, 2 years ago,3,"I've owned Fords in the past and they were all disappointing. This one had several recalls on the transmission. When I tried to contact Ford about what my options were with this transmission issue they basically said I had to wait to see if the trans faulted to have any repairs made. Now I am upside down in payments and the car is worth next to nothing. It sputters while driving down the road, acts like it might cut off while idling in a drive thru and it only has approx 40k miles on it. For a 2016 vehicle it is really not worth the money I was charged for it. I will never buy another Ford."
3843, 2 years ago,3,"Uncomfortable, felt cheap, luckily I only had it as a rental. Buttons East to use just not for me"
3844, 2 years ago,3,"So uncomfortable, not a smooth ride but controls are easy to use. Smaller version of an explorer"
3845,2 years ago,3,"This is a nice car, I wish I would have gotten something bigger. I haven't had very many problems with mine. The only 2 things that have went wrong was my fuel pump and there is a covering underneath my car that has to be zip tied because someone ripped it off and it broke all the things that held it up."
3846, 2 years ago,5,Love the color. Love the sound system.  I just wish it was a little better on gas like my Nissan rogue was . The color is nice and the dash board is very clean and easy to use.
3847, 2 years ago,5,I love this vehicle. It has everything I need. My kids are comfortable in the back seat. Alot of room in the back for traveling. Great on mileage.
3848, 2 years ago,5,"I've had this car for 7 years. Bought it used as a 2009 with over 150k miles. It's taken me from CT to NY, Chicago, MA, RI, DE, MD, VA and back many times. Never had a major issue this whole time and other than routine maintenance I've only had to spend a total of $730 for repairs during the whole time I've owned it. I'm now at 268k miles and going strong. It still sounds and drives like new. Best choice I've ever made. When it's time for me to get a new car, I plan on upgrading to the Explorer model for my next purchase."
3849, 2 years ago,5,"I love my lil car, great run around. It is not too big and easy to park, also very smooth to drive. Highly recommend as a first time car. Or even as a family car."
3850,2 years ago,3,"I had a 2014 Ford Focus and finally gave it up after replacing the third clutch in an automatic car. It was a nice vehicle for a first car, but after the repair guy said I'd need to replace the part again, I had enough. Won't buy another Focus, that's for sure."
3851, 2 years ago,5,"Everyone calls it a mom car, which is honestly my favorite. It’s super spacious, the trunk has an option of turning into a loading dock which is super helpful if you need to travel with things. It’s a good price range for people who want a starter car. As a commenter in college, it’s good on gas as well. The one I own is a 2014 model, so it is missing some of the newer gadgets, but still includes a backup camera and a small dashboard screen to show what music is playing."
3852, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford fusion hybrid. I work Monday to Friday and I normally only have to fill up once every 2 weeks. Even when I fill up I normally only have to pay at most 14 but this really depends on the gas price and when I am filling up, which I try to do when I get half a tank of gas left."
3853, 2 years ago,5,I love the my ford Escape there’s enough room for everything and everyone but it’s not to big. Perfect for my active family of 4.
3854,2 years ago,5,I owned this car for 8 years. Really good reliable car. Was used as a cart horse for me.
3855, 2 years ago,4,This is one of the car companies I was raised to buy. They have amazing new and old cars. It's American made!!
3856, 2 years ago,5,"Absolutely loved it. Ran good, didnt get stuck easily, not even in the snow, very spacious, runs great, goes about anywhere, amd good on gas."
3857, 2 years ago,4,"This car has a great predicted reliability rating, a spacious interior, and engaging performance, but its middling interior quality keeps it from being a class leader."
3858, 2 years ago,5,Great American car ! It is awesome on gas and very easy to park. Very sporty yet stylish
3859, 2 years ago,5,"Car runs ok.. very compact, great for parking. Although the car was easy to drive we did often have transmission issues."
3860, 2 years ago,5,The focus is like the bloke version of the fiesta. I love the focus and if I’d have known how much I was going to love driving I would have purchased a focus but it might be next on my to buy list. I have been in a focus and driven one and everything about it was comparable to the fiesta.
3861, 2 years ago,5,My cars my favourite thing I own. I’d be lost without it. My dream car before I could drive was a Ford Fiesta and by the time it came around to my driving test I was able to afford one. I love everything about my car and I would purchase another one if the time was to come and I needed to upgrade.
3862, 2 years ago,5,"Love love love my cute little focus, absolutely perfect for my family. If anything goes wrong its an easy fix and not to pricy on my bank account. And they last forever!!!"
3863, 2 years ago,5,Had as a car when I was younger. It was reliable and comfortable. Compact and great on gas.
3864, 2 years ago,4,Had a lot of recall issues and I don’t think the warranty is the best but is a good little suv. Rooms and I can fit two car seats in the back
3865, 2 years ago,4,"It's good on gas probably better for a student. It's small, but has some go power. Great gas mileage! Make a better clutch for it-other than that I dig it. Affordable for a new car. Comfortable. I would recommend for a student or first time driver."
3866, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. It’s American made. Decent gas mileage. Comfortable seats. Minimal upkeep
3867, 2 years ago,5,My family have had these types of cards since I can remember! I think they're an amazing family car also good for long distance driving as they get alot for the MPG! They are also very aesthetically pleasing in certain colours and have very very nice interior! Would highly recommend at alllllll costs
3868, 2 years ago,5,"I purchased this car back in 2014 to replace a car that was no longer functional. At that point, I had never owned a Ford, but after one drive of this car, it was the perfect match. It was affordable and just the right size for me (I have the hatchback body shape). It allows me to get to where I need to go and gives the plenty of room for me, my family and basics like getting groceries and transporting my music equipment. "
3869,2 years ago,4,Brilliant car. This is my first car and it’s so easy to drive. The clutch is smooth and the car is so fuel efficient! Nice smallish car but also really spacious and would fit 5 fine
3870,2 years ago,5,"This has been a wonderful vehicle. Purchased for strictly a work vehicle because of fuel economy, comfort, and value. It is driven nearly 400 miles per week and has never had a major issue. Only ownership costs has been routine maintenance and typical wear and tear replacements, i.e. tires, brakes, wiper blades, fluids etc."
3871, 2 years ago,5,I adore my Ford escape. It's the perfect size. Gets around like a nice little sedan but still gives you the SUV feel. Where I live 4 wheel drive is always a good thing and I've never had an issue with it sliding around. My friends for comfortably inside along with my dog! I have great gas milage. It's a smooth ride. Very sleek interior.
3872, 2 years ago,5,My boyfriend had one. Loved the heated seats option during those cold months. Had a sunroof. Rose really nice. Great radio and speakers from the factory and built in GPS.
3873, 2 years ago,5,Have had the car for 12 years. It's a great and reliable car. I drive it daily and alot of miles. They no longer make my version but I recommend getting one if you need a new car. It was affordable and is good on gas.
3874,2 years ago,4,This is a great everyday car. I wish it had more room in the back seat. I feel for a small SUV there should be more leg room for everyone. It does drive nice and smooth though and it is a safe choice for family.
3875, 2 years ago,5,"Love my Ford Flex. I was wanting 2 rows without getting a minivan. Perfect for my growing family. Very spacious my 6'3 hubby fit in the back row, so plenty of leg room."
3876, 2 years ago,5,I dont know at all. I dont have a car i never drive car here !  But love to have one h😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜😜🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮
3877, 2 years ago,5,Drives very nice. Once I’ve had my current car for at least 1.5 years ( if it lasts that long) I’m probably going to get a focus as my first new car. They are very affordable and gas is decent. Moderately recommended.
3878, 2 years ago,5,These are very nice cars with very nice features. My mom has this car and i love how spacious it is. I love that it has a sun roof and back up cameras
3879,2 years ago,5,"I own a 2017 Ford Fusion and I love it! It is the perfect size for me as a single mother of an 8 year old. The technology is great, all wheel drive takes me anywhere I want to go. If someone is looking for an alternative to an SUV and you don’t need a large vehicle, please check out a fusion! It would also be a great starter vehicle for a new driver."
3880, 2 years ago,1,I drive a 2013 and have constant problems!   There have been 6 recalls since owing it.  I would not recommend this to anyone!
3881, 2 years ago,5,"Love my little car. It’s perfect for short journeys, fits in any parking space and is even comfortable for longer journeys. Compared to similar models from other brands I’d say it’s relatively affordable. I don’t think you’re paying for the brand like you are with Mercedes or Audi for example."
3882, 2 years ago,4,Love this car and it is reliable however I got into a car accident and it was actually very expensive to fix with the other person getting a small dent and the whole front end of my car was crinkled. Also very small!
3883, 2 years ago,5,I love my 2017 Ford Fusion SE. It's charcoal gray color gives it a sleek look. It handles well. I have driven it a lot and the only things I have replaced are tires and brakes. It's leather interior is soft and comfortable. Great car for the money.  Ford Fusion
3884, 2 years ago,5,Had apple car play. Smooth ride. Wish there wasn’t as much road noice but that’s because my daily driver is a Luxery car.
3885,2 years ago,5,Was a smooth ride in the car. Been a while since I have been in one but high tech for the age but can be expensive to get parts for
3886, 2 years ago,5,I LOVED this car! This was my first adult car. I loved how roomy it was! The ambient lighting feature that Ford offers is so cool! I loved changing the light color based on my mood.
3887, 2 years ago,5,Great car with great features! This car is very economical and we actually purchased 2 at the same time! The gas mileage is great and is a hreat car for my mother-in-law!
3888, 2 years ago,5,I've constantly re rented Ford escapes since I first ever got one! I have my third one right now and I am always always going to love this car. We've driven Ford's in my family almost my whole life and man I wouldn't have it any other way! I completely recommend this vehicle!
3889, 2 years ago,4,I don’t like being low to the ground but the car was fine for a rental. I’m more of an suv person
3890, 2 years ago,4,"It's a good car, has great inside space and trunk. The engine is pretty good but it has two issues, the inside is falling apart every now and then, and it has a manufacturer's issue in one of the tires that makes the tire deteriorates faster than the other tires."
3891, 2 years ago,5,My mom and my grandma have a Ford escape they are great cards and a very smooth ride. Over all a great car. My mom and grandma love their cars
3892, 2 years ago,4,Great car reliable. The only downside is the hardware updates that need to happen. Sometimes they are not done right and I have issues.
3893, 2 years ago,5,Love the leather. Amazing interior design. Very comfortable and great for messy kids. Amazing sun roof and radio! We could improve the amount of miles. Lol very affordable compared to all the cars coming out now. Defiantly recommend this amazing car!!!
3894, 2 years ago,5,"I’ve had this car for 3 years and it’s great compared to others I’ve had. It’s small but roomy, easy to park and get in/out of tight spaces. Pretty smooth to drive for a Ford and looks good. If you need a car to get you from point A to B but don’t want anything too fancy, then this is the one to start with for a few years so you figure what you like and dislike in a car."
3895, 2 years ago,4,It's been a good car so far.  I've have for the last 7 years and have had no major problems.  I'd highly recommend buying it.
3896, 2 years ago,1,This car is hideous. I absolutely hate it. I felt like a smurf when driving around in it and didn’t feel safe on the road.
3897, 2 years ago,4,Great car for the family - we have owned two used Ford explorers in the past and we loved the car.Easy to manage and good mileage - we used to have a 7 seater and it was comfortable for the whole family and good for long trips. Nothing over the top but just what you need without all the frills.If I had a get an SUV again might go in for a FORD 
3898, 2 years ago,4,"I think a Ford Fiesta is a great first car. It is cheap to run, I have a 1.4l and pay around £45 for a full tank. I do find in some fords the most common faults are the gearboxs. But the cars are very comfortable and do have some speed to them!"
3899, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely loved my Ford Fiesta it was so spacious. I would highly recommend if you’re a new driver or even for a family car. I took my car everywhere and the petrol was so affordable a full tank wasn’t even that much money, it was about 30/35 pound to fill up. A full tank lasts quite a while I’m from Newcastle area and drove it all the way to Edinburgh and back and still had left over petrol. It is amazing!!"
3900, 2 years ago,4,"I have enjoyed my Fusion, especially in the summer.  However in the winter I find it extremely hard to deal with in my climate.  The front of the car is too low to the ground, and I get caught in the snow much more than I would like.  My next car will be much higher for that reason."
3901, 2 years ago,4,"Great little car.  For a basic small sedan, it has most of the features that you need in a car.  Rearview camera, bluetooth, multiple USB ports and easy to reach features.  The only thing I dislike is the overall size (it is a smaller car, even though this is now becoming the normal for average sized sedans), and my biggest pet peeve with cars is having a ""sirius"" button in them.  I can't find many people that continue to pay for the Sirius XM subscription past the free trial.  Waste of a button and technology that could be used elsewear."
3902, 2 years ago,4,SMOOTH RUNNING VEHICLE. INNOVATIVE SHAPE AND A CUTE SIZE THATS ROOMY AND SMALL AT THE SAME TIME.......
3903,2 years ago,5,"It has so good steering. Its fast, cheap, good equipped. Easy to drive. Give so much fun from drive to driver. I could buy IT again. New generations are so beautyful and goodlooking. I dream about focus rs but its too expensive for me so i tuningy car to make IT faster and looking better"
3904, 2 years ago,4,"I’ve ridden in this as a passenger only. Not really much to comment on. It was comfortable, roomy enough, & seemed like a smooth ride."
3905, 2 years ago,4,"Haven’t had a lot of experience with this particular Make & Model, but I’ve driven in at least a couple, & no complaints!"
3906, 2 years ago,4,"My daughter has this car, and I think it suits her well! Nice size bc she’s single, good gas mileage, enough room for groceries/shopping, etc."
3907, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford Fusion. It has by far been one of the best cars in regards to fuel efficiency, comfort, and safety. So far my car has been reliable, and durable. I would say on average these cars are very affordable, and worth whatever money you put into them!"
3908, 2 years ago,5,I bought my fusion a little over a year ago. It has been an amazing car overall. I use it for my work daily i put in about 70 to 80 miles just while working. The sync system works amazing. Very good on gas even with constant stop and go. If you're looking for a great car i highly recommend taking a look at the fusion
3909, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Fusion. Its been very reliable. The ecoboost engine is so fuel efficient. Ive taken it on more road trips than i can count. Mountains, cities and long stretches of highways."
3910, 2 years ago,2,"We had a Ford Escape for several years and had over 200,000 miles on it. The thing needed tune up after tune up and never ran perfectly. When they say Ford stands for Found on road dead they mean it. "
3911, 2 years ago,4,Spacious car with nice features. Great for families and safe. Nice front dash and roomy.
3912, 2 years ago,5,These are great small suvs and they can fit a lot of things in them. I used to own a 2008 Ford Escape and then was able to be a passenger in a newer one and they both had some great qualities. I now own a 2019 ford escape and it's better then I remembered.  They are easy to drive and have lots of room.
3913,2 years ago,5,Got my fusion in 2017 and it’s my favorite. Only thing I wish I had heated seats on it
3914, 2 years ago,4,"I have a 2015 fusion. I love the big screen, leather seats, and gps system. Although I am looking to upgrade to an SUV soon my fusion has been so good to me ❤️"
3915, 2 years ago,5,La verdad es que son muy cómodos y fáciles de manejar. Mi amigo no ha tenido ningún problema desde que adquirió el suyo. Excelente marca. 
3916, 2 years ago,5,First car I got out of high school was very reliable lasted many years and affordable I have nothing bad to say about the Ford Focus
3917, 2 years ago,5,It's a really nice car I like riding in it very spacious nice interior and from what I've known it is a car that is Affordable
3918, 2 years ago,4,Economic and affordable. Great gas mileage. Variety of color options. Great starter car for young drivers and also great for the driver who wants a small eco footprint.
3919,2 years ago,3,"Good power, very good handling and overall not a bad value for an economy car.  Compares nicely to General Motors automobiles in the same class."
3920, 2 years ago,5,This is a great reliable car. It looks sleek and drives sleek for a great fair price. It gets great gas mileage and has a nice big gas tank. I love the heated seats that is very convient in the winter time. I would recommend this car this another with 2 or less children.
3921, 2 years ago,5,A fun drive and a good first car. Looks very smart and the interior is also great. It’s not too expensive but very reliable. Gets you for a to b. I’m currently learning to drive so I find this quite easy to operate.
3922, 2 years ago,5,Ford dealership take your privacy seriously and is committed recommend to family and friends
3923, 2 years ago,5,I had a 2011 and it was one of my favorite cars and was actually amazing in the snow. The only thing I did not like about it was the sound system
3924,2 years ago,3,"I love my car, however, it has problems with the clutch. It's been replaced under warranty, and the replacement also is problematic. The interior is perfect for me, I prefer driving a Ford."
3925, 2 years ago,5,I love my ford escape. I find it to be the perfect size. It's intuitive to drive. My favourite part is the windshield and hope the wipers work. Easy maintenance. I have all the upgrades with the titanium trim and it feels luxurious lol everyone should get a ford!
3926, 2 years ago,4,Own an F150. The truck is great in the winter time. It can get through any snow. I also love it to move things since it's bed is huge!
3927,2 years ago,2,"Worst vehicle I ever had. One thing after another went wrong with it and my boyfriend and another good friend of mine had the same car and had the same issues. The windows fell inside the door twice, we had to get them replaced and this happened to my friends car also. After this and my hatchback I decided I won’t ever buy ford again until they can put more money into making their vehicles. This one cost me too much throughout the years."
3928, 2 years ago,3,"It drives very well through anything really the Ford edge is sleek minivanish looking however it will drive through literally anything almost but beware as Ford stands for found on road dead yeah this one after you hit it I'd say 100,000 miles you might as well scrap it because everything's going to start breaking in beautiful Ford fashion"
3929, 2 years ago,5,"Beautiful comfortable, refined and relaxing drive. Initiative and easy to use infotainment services with excellent navigation sistem"
3930, 2 years ago,4,I have been driving my Ford Fusion for 5 years.   I love it.  The only problem that I have is that sometimes the sync doesn't always connect to my phone and more then once it has either called the incorrect number or doesn't hear me at all without yelling.   Otherwise it is a great car
3931, 2 years ago,5,I like my Ford Fusion a lot. I’ve never had any severe problems with it and it gets decent gas mileage.
3932, 2 years ago,5,"Check out the all-new redesigned Ford Escape SUV see features like the heads up display ,stylish interior design"
3933, 2 years ago,3,"I am not a Ford person at all. They seem like a nice family car, however not something for younger ages"
3934,2 years ago,5,I done my driving lessons in a Ford Focus. Lovely car to drive. Nice size aswel not too big. I would of bought one myself if they wer more affordable.
3935, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car! It’s so easy to drive perfect for a first time driver. There’s plenty of space for storing stuff and I love that it has a usb charging port, much easier than using the cigarette lighter. Can easily fit five people."
3936, 2 years ago,1,It has been nothing but issues. I have had it break down countless times. If I could give it - stars I would.
3937, 2 years ago,4,"Best company to buy or rent a car, the cars ate super comfortable and they have a lot of space inside"
3938, 2 years ago,5,Ford has been a favorite of my family for as long as I can remember. The style and luxury of all Ford's vehicles is really impressive. They have stayed ahead of the game with their designs and their new selections over the years. Would happily drive any Ford
3939, 2 years ago,3,I had a Ford Focus for a few years. It was a mode pf transportation. It wasn't a car that had much comfort. It was a second hand car.
3940, 2 years ago,4,I own a 2012 Ford Fusion and it has been one of the best cars I have ever owned. It’s been very reliable and I have only had minor issues. I would recommend this car to just about anyone looking for a reliable and affordable vehicle.
3941,2 years ago,5,"I love my car ! It's nice from inside and out ! I'm in school so its great for a girl like me ! It's fancy, classy, just like me ! So I love it !!"
3942, 2 years ago,4,"I heard many horrifying acronyms for Ford and am very happy I didn't let it sway me from owning my first SUV! My Ford Explorer was a dream, not a nightmare. It was affordable, ran for over 250,000 miles before I had to sell it off because I wanted a car I could travel more in! I had a few minor issues with hoses and coolant and the major issue came after 250,000 miles when the transmission went out. At that point I knew it was time to part ways because I feared other issues that would supercede the value of the car. I truly enjoyed the the years I drove my Ford Explorer and side eye people who make jokes about Ford's unreliability before I tell them about the used Ford I bought and drove for 13 years!"
3943, 2 years ago,5,I drive a mustang daily and would absolutely buy another one. The only con is my convertible leaks but it’s amazing. 
3944, 2 years ago,5,"Love my Ford Escape titanium day td great fuel consumption, and the handling is amazing"
3945, 2 years ago,3,Great on gas and nice for traveling as well for 2-3 people MAX (when traveling far). They have nice and sturdy frames and are built with quality.
3946, 2 years ago,4,"Easy to park since its small and i think this kind of car looks elegant when a girl driving it. The only i didn't like about this car is i really dont have a knowledge in automotive stuff. Sorry guys, i only drive and my dad do the maintenance thingy 😅"
3947, 2 years ago,5,I used to drive a Ford Fusion and I miss it. It is an awesome car all around. High quality
3948, 2 years ago,5,I have always loved the look of this car and how it rides. Awesome SUV all around recommend strongly
3949, 2 years ago,5,"Very good car, easy to drive, has a great sat navigation system and very comfortable to sit in"
3950, 2 years ago,5,"Very easy car to drive, easy to use good to learn in, good handling and has very good pick up speed, cheap to repair"
3951, 2 years ago,4,"If you're going to get an escape, definitely get the upgrades models, like the SEL or platinum edition. The leather is like butter and super comfortable in comparison to the cloth seats in the lower models. Gps is always available without a subscription, which is nice. Back up camera comes in handy. And its a very smooth ride. Ford Escape"
3952, 2 years ago,5,My hubby has the Ford 150. It is comfortable enough for us to take on trips. Good on gas and no service issues.
3953, 2 years ago,5,"Ford fusion, really good car i think in everyday life, hybrid one i mean 👐 there is plug in one too, but better hybrid because u will be anyway on hybrid after 20-30 min and u lost space in the trunk, in pug in there isnt space at all... dont worth it.. very comfortable and reliable car ! Ford fusion titanium model anyway ❤"
3954,2 years ago,4,"Nice compact car, rides comfortable and blocks outter noise. Has okay cabin space, back seating is tight specially for adults. Lots of high tech options and it's an affordable vehicle."
3955, 2 years ago,5,I would say its an easy car nice comfort to drive if you a new driver i would advise you to be careful because you think you driving with a slow speed but its very speedy i don't know if that make sense but yeah
3956, 2 years ago,5,"Comfortable to drive, all controls within easy reach, low maintenance and good gas mileage. Easy to get in and out of parking spaces and maneuver in traffic."
3957, 2 years ago,5,Nice small suv.  Comfortable ride and drive SVC offers enough cargo space for groceries and luggage.
3958, 2 years ago,5,My mom has a Ford Fusion and it's such a stylish car. The body is so beautifully built and it so spacious. At night it looks so edgy! It definitely turns heads when my mom drives it around. It's also so great on gas. Hers is a flex fuel!
3959,2 years ago,5,I just think it a gorgeous looking car to be honest and it would hold a big family and it cheap.
3960, 2 years ago,5,"Excellent first car, my best friend has a white one and it is so smooth to drive and is quite fast. It is excellent for everyday use and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an affordable first car. It doesn't cost much in fuel either"
3961, 2 years ago,4,"Efficient and practical car. Dependable and has all the modern features you'd expect. Back up camera as a basic inclusion is nice. Great on gas and handles well. Great purchase for lower end price range. Only draw back is fitting two children in car seats in the back. My Baby needs to go behind me and when his infant seat is installed I am crammed into the dash. So we have to move him behind the passenger seat. Which means no passengers can fit without also being jammed into the dash. Not a great family car, as far as room goes. But still a solid purchase for my price range."
3962, 2 years ago,5,I love this car! It’s spacious without being huge! It drives so smooth and handles bumps and curves very well! It’s great on gas mileage and lasts forever! I’ve had mine for over 7 years now and it’s still going strong!
3963,2 years ago,3,"My husband and I own a '14 Ford Fiesta in their most basic model. It's not anything I would be impressed with. Everything in the car is as basic as you can possibly get. There was also a huge settlement with Ford and the buyers of vehicles from certain years for the transmission, I believe. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy a Fiesta when it actually has less features and power than my Chevy Malibu does."
3964, 2 years ago,4,This was my first vehicle when i was younger. I felt safe when i drove. It’s very small but reliable. I would buy this vehicle for my kids i. The future. It’s a very affordable vehicle and great on gas.
3965, 2 years ago,5,My family and I love our little sedan. I personally don’t ever care for small vehicles but i fell in love with this car. It’s great on gas and it is very reliable. I recommend this vehicle if you like saving on gas.
3966, 2 years ago,3,I have a Focus from 07. It is still running great. It was my first car and has been reliable for me. Not the most stylish of cars. Mine doesn't have any fancy features. But it gets the job done. Overall a good car. Mine is just on the older end. Hence the 3 star review.
3967,2 years ago,4,"This car was just ~okay~ it drives pretty smoothly but it has a lot of blind spots. Seems pretty sturdy and reliable, though, so can't really complain too much! "
3968, 2 years ago,5,"This is the best vehicle I ever have, I don’t think I would change for never, i just love it."
3969, 2 years ago,5,"This is my first car ford focus SE and I love it, it’s confortable and have a good price."
3970, 2 years ago,5,"Great car for family, inside is so big, the children have so Many space, you need this for family trip, is elegance,"
3971, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford fusion. It drives very smooth. M
I have keyless entry and heated seats. The navigation screen is a nice size and links well with my phone."
3972, 2 years ago,4,"Runs smoothly and very comfortable in the inside. Very spacious in the back. I did like it, but I wouldn’t trade my Subaru for it."
3973,2 years ago,5,"Love this car, i have it a year old, it’s amazing all the different modes it has (sports mode/eco mode). I travel to work and home a lot, and also tend to drive miles to different city’s and it’s so reliable!"
3974, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car it has taken me so many places and the engine is still in great condition its a 2010, we’ve taken it to Cali 3 times, Denver  twice and  Arizona like 100 and It still hasn’t given any problems"
3975, 2 years ago,4,"I like the car, however there were issues here and there that had to be resolved mechanically."
3976, 2 years ago,5,"Well functioning vehicle that is very dependable in all driving conditions, rarely ever any issues."
3977, 2 years ago,4,Ford is not really my favorite car but I like it. There’s no pro or cons to it. I would improve the seats. Not really my type. Not my car was borrowing from my aunt. I would recommend to any one who like Ford’s.
3978, 2 years ago,5,"I just got this car within the last 6 months, but so far I love it! It drives really well, has a lot of cool features, and the exterior is really nice! I don’t love big cars, so this is the perfect size!"
3979, 2 years ago,5,I actually had a Ford Taurus the Ford fusion took over the Ford Taurus but I had a 2012 or 2013 brand new Ford Taurus and had 3200 miles on it it was a great car so comfortable seats grade heated seats the free features for just amazing the car was absolutely perfect it was my best car I've ever had was in my car cuz I don't have a license but it was my boyfriend's at the time but I still got to drive it even though that's not allowed but that car that was I fell in love with a car that was the best car I've ever had in my life.
3980, 2 years ago,5,This car feels so good when inside it you feel the road so smooth. This car has so much cool features.
3981, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford escape. I have a 2018 that I upgraded from a 2012 escape. The seats are comfortable. The touch screen is a great feature that connects to your phone. With the app you can locate your car, start it, lock it, get any recall information, etc. It's very cool. I haven't had any issues with it."
3982, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car! My boyfriend has this car and it will probably be my next car. It’s roomy, techy, and just overall nice looking. Highly recommend! Drive smoothly and had heated seats. Probably one of my favorites."
3983, 2 years ago,5,I live my little Ford Focus! It is so reliable and great on gas mileage! I have taken many trips with this car! I found my to be very affordable! Plus I think they look cute! I would recommend! Plus it’s popular so repairs and finding parts is easy
3984, 2 years ago,5,Great suv but drove more like a truck not as smooth a drive as our Subaru. It was very roomy and had nice upgrades but a bit of a bumpy ride
3985, 2 years ago,4,"My mom has this car. IDK I feel that it's a little cheaply made. I mean it's no BMW, but it's economical. Good grocery getter."
3986, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVED my 2008 Ford Fusion! If I had the option that's the car I'd still have. It had a faulty hood latch, but other than that I have no complaints. Miss it."
3987, 2 years ago,4,"I have owned my car for many years now. It has been a great car that has served me well.
I would change the cloth used on the seats.and the clear coat over the paint as it does not wear well in the sun as well as the material the hub caps are made from. The overall drivability is good, it’s comfortable, reliable and gets good gas mileage."
3988, 2 years ago,5,Love the way the car handles and looks. The seats were not comfortable. Ford can have overpriced vehicles.
3989, 2 years ago,5,"This has been my favorite car. The gas mileage is perfect, the interior is so easy to clean. The seats are able to adjust the curves for backs and this has helped me so much on my long drives."
3990, 2 years ago,4,"I love my Ford focus, he gets great gas milage and works for my life style. My husband can take it to the mountain bike trail, and all three of my kids fit in it."
3991, 2 years ago,4,"I own a 2015 Ford focus hatchback, the issue I have with it is more of the dealership issue. The clutch has failed bit there's a nation wide warranty on it but it has now expired. I have the titanium package which for that model is the highest level. I have an issue with my sun roof it won't close so it'll re open, the sensor is the issue. It's made cheap and not for big people as I have learned from my parents it's uncomfortable for the legs. It has rises on the out sides of the legs. I bought this car used with only 25k miles on it for 10k it is what I could afford. It's a great car for what it is, great MPG love the storage and access to the trunk. And there's a hide away so they can't see what's in the trunk. I have tinted windows so no one can see inside. All and all for a cheap car it's great luxury purpose no."
3992, 2 years ago,4,"Great economy vehicle, basic but doesnt feel boring.  Perfect size for a family and always has a huge truck to carry all your stuff.  Reliable and never had a major issue."
3993, 2 years ago,5,I currently have the 2020 model and i love it! It’s easy to drive and the perfect size for me. I love the screen it comes with and Apple car play is so helpful!
3994,2 years ago,5,Very reliable and affordable car. This is my first car I have ever bought and I have added accessories to make it look cool and fast.
3995,2 years ago,4,"It is my first car and has always been reliable, comfortable and easy to learn how to drive in x"
3996,2 years ago,5,I like the Ford Escape. They have bluetooth which i love your not to float the ground as some cars.
3997, 2 years ago,3,"I had a 2006 focus. Good car and extremely reliable. Got me where I needed to go at the time and had decent gas mileage (around 24 mpg). Nothing too luxurious. Very affordable, would recommend for a new driver."
3998,2 years ago,5,Nice car great gas mileage cozy seats drives nice and smooth. Seems small  for an SUV tho.
3999, 2 years ago,5,incredible car that I had in my beginnings I was very happy with the performance very aggressive look a real muscle car high quality interiors and powerful engine I recommend it
4000, 2 years ago,5,This is my first car and I love it! Super cool and trendy but also reliable and a decent size. The car has never let me down and whilst it’s safe still allows me freedom and a bit of fun. Would recommend to anyone looking for their first car.
4001, 2 years ago,4,"I am not a fan of the newer designs however, I had an escape a few years ago and I loved that design. It was reliable, good on gas for being an suv, and comfortable. I am a big fan of Ford and have been happy with their cars. I’ve leased a total of 3."
4002, 2 years ago,5,"I have own a fusion as well as a few family members have them. This car is very reliable, pretty good on gas, and comfortable. Ford has been our go to car for my family and the fusion is a great option."
4003, 2 years ago,3,"My uncle owns a car like this, he doesnt like luxury brands or cars and I think this could the perfect car for people who like simple things"
4004, 2 years ago,4,"I think it’s a great car to buy. Ford have a-lot of equipment for a low price. Food quality, and the price doesn’t drop so fast after buying. Finishing touches in interior could be better, and visibility on the back should be improved, because it  have very small windows on the rear part. "
4005, 2 years ago,4,This was the first SUV i owned and I loved it. I’m not too fond of the look on the newer models. I much prefer the more traditional SUV look. Felt very safe. Great gas mileage.
4006, 2 years ago,5,Me and my husband rented this car for vacation. Very nice car. Really good gas mileage. Very expensive tho. And kind of small.
4007, 2 years ago,5,Have been riding in my sister's 2014 Ford Focus and it still runs perfectly. Has been through a lot and still has very few problems.
4008, 2 years ago,4,"Got a 2019 Ford Fiesta for my first car and I love it. It is just odd to me because my sister owns a 2014 Ford Focus and the interior is the same. The screen, the buttons, everything. I would think that they would change the interior some within the 5 years."
4009,2 years ago,5,"UMA, Amei, simplismente amei cada carro tem um design único proporcional e confortável, meus irmãos tem carros e cada um  com sua própria comodidade "
4010, 2 years ago,5,Great car! Its gets awesome gas mileage. It drives and rides smooth. There are no cons about it. It's safe and reliable great for every day commute. Its inexpensive and need no improvement.
4011,2 years ago,5,"Ótima estrutura, ótimo manuseio espaçoso Etc, sempre achei esse carro muito bonito e elegante e um dos que eu quero ter futuramente "
4012, 2 years ago,5,I now own a 1997 Ford Taurus. This car is well built and has low miles for its age. It has cruise control but doesn't have a CD player. It is a very roomy car and it makes a person feel very safe because it is built with metal and not plastic!!!
4013,2 years ago,4,Plain Jane! Affordable but not very exciting. It is just the type of car you purchase to get yourself from point A to point B. I have it 4 stars though because of its reliability.
4014, 2 years ago,5,This compact car has great gas mileage and very affordable. It’s a great car for high school and college students.
4015, 2 years ago,4,My friend actually owns it so I can't really comment on it. It gets us from Point A to Point B...  she has definitely ran it into the ground but all in all it still runs good. She delivers pizzas in it so that must say something lol
4016, 2 years ago,5,I love my suv runs good plenty of space and great on gas! I wouldnt drive anything but a Ford!!!! Its never given me any issues thankfully! The only thing i would like is a 3rd row seat but i can upgrade to a explorer for that! But i highly recommend
4017, 2 years ago,2,"The upsides to this car for me are the size and comfort. The downsides are a small fuel tank, mechanic issues, and look."
4018,2 years ago,3,I personally do not have one and would not want one. Almost everyone that I know who had gotten one has had to get so much fixed on it and not normal wear and tear. It's affordable but many have had technical issues even the sync. 
4019,2 years ago,4,A good little car for the price but I have had some issues with it. Overall it does it's job and has worked well but it definitely is not the type of car to last decades. 
4020, 2 years ago,3,"I test drove a Ford Escape when looking for a new vehicle, because my best friend owns one. It has a backup camera, and a nice radio/audio/camera display. There is key free entrance with a code on the door which is really nice, and different security."
4021, 2 years ago,2,"When looking for a new vehicle, I drove a Ford Focus. It sat so close to the ground, I felt like I had to pull myself off of the ground togl get out of it. It drove pretty smoothly, but felt a little loose with steering. I've never been a huge fan of Ford, and this vehicle didn't help."
4022, 2 years ago,5,Our Ford Escape is dependable and I love how it looks. Was nice having it to sneak out to see the sunset during quarantine hehe
4023, 2 years ago,5,I have had 3 ford escapes since 2008 and loved all of them. Each time I got a new one was simply to upgrade. My current escape is a 2013 and I do love it but I now have a almost 2 year old son and the back seat isn't very roomy with a car seat in it. But that is just temporary!
4024, 2 years ago,4,Loved loved loved my escape! Upgraded to an Edge that I also love!! Ford Escape was amazing on gas!
4025, 2 years ago,5,We absolutely love our Ford Escape.  We’ve never had anything but minor issues with it the last five years.  It’s a smooth ride and worth the money we have put into it.
4026, 2 years ago,4,I would like to drive the Ford Fiesta st. It’s a small car with a good amount of power and looks fun to drive. It’s a great car to have as a fun commuter.
4027, 2 years ago,5,"Smooth drive, but I don’t care for the looks of the vehicle. Not sporty enough for me. But good value."
4028, 2 years ago,4,"Decent everyday driver. No serious issues after 3 years of owning. One small design problem is it collects tons of leaves under the corners of the hood where the hood meets the windshield. Plenty of room inside the car/trunk, drives well, and is very comfortable."
4029,2 years ago,4,Great little compact midsize car. Fits my family for perfect for a nice little road trip or running around town to do errands. Great on gas which is a huge plus￼
4030, 2 years ago,4,This handled nicely on the road and had a smooth ride. The Interior was comfortable and had plenty of room for a smaller SUV.
4031,2 years ago,5,This was a really nice car. Great on gas mileage no problems with it when I got it. It was brand new off the lot!
4032, 2 years ago,5,Very smooth driving. Interior is sleek and classic. Is automatic and is a great starter car
4033, 2 years ago,3,I like this car but is not so comfortable inside need like a little bit of more space
4034, 2 years ago,4,"Very cute car. I used to have an edge which was my favorite car and this is a close second. Only issue is that if you need a part, it’s very expensive."
4035, 2 years ago,5,"Roomy and comfortable. Plenty of ports to charge your phone :) And it has a pretty good sound system, too."
4036,2 years ago,5,"Such a smooth car to drive.
Good on fuel, cheap to run
Comfortable interior
Easy to clean, though I do typically take 6 hours to clean throughly
Great for city driving"
4037, 2 years ago,3,I test drove a lightly used Ford fiesta a few years ago and really liked it. I was going to purchase it but when I had it looked at the mechanics I took it to said it really wasn't a good car. Especially for me since I drive so much. He said the Ford fiestas almost always have problems with the AC and the engine within the first few years and that it would not be a purchase for me.
4038, 2 years ago,3,"This is a very sporty car. The handing is amazing!! However, it kept having mechanical issues. Thankfully it was just a rental."
4039, 2 years ago,1,Nope nope nope I don’t like fords at all they break down easily and aren’t as powerful I would totally improve this car 100% the price for them are too much for what they do I wouldn’t recommend.
4040, 2 years ago,5,We rented this car a few months ago and now I want one! This car drives extremely well! We had a hybrid model which was perfect for driving around the city of Miami and long distance traveling. High recommend this vehicle if you’re looking for something to save on gas but have plenty of leg room and trunk space.
4041, 2 years ago,5,"Got the St line around a year ago for my 2nd car, love it! Never had a problem with it, it's good on fuel and with it being an ecoboost it's free on road tax. Think it's a very affordable car, and not too bad on insurance either. Would definitely recommend"
4042, 2 years ago,4,"Very heavy duty car! It can handle many things like snow, rough terrain, and heavy rain. The maintenace is also easy."
4043, 2 years ago,3,"A well-maintained Fiesta will almost certainly be a more reliable car than an abused and mistreated Honda, and vice-versa. Statistically speaking, brands like Toyota or Honda, will have better dependability in the long run over American branded vehicles."
4044, 2 years ago,4,"The one I had was a lariat, was very nice and had all the bells and whistles. This truck was sleek and smooth riding. I don't really have any recommendation for improvement. I think it's a bit expensive but worth it in the end!!"
4045, 2 years ago,5,The escape is very roomy and does well on the hill side. I do not like the blind spots in the vehicle along with the mirrors on the newer models. It looks very sport and is a great family car.
4046,2 years ago,5,I drive a 2008 Ford Expedition daily 100 miles round trip to school. Its is a well built low maintenance vehicle!
4047, 2 years ago,4,"I have a Ford f150 and I love it. Gets good milage, hasn't had many bad things happen other than normal stuff"
4048,2 years ago,1,"Very bad experience with Ford and a transmission in a car I bought. Was given the run around 4 times. Asked them to replace the whole thing they said it would cost too much( it was under warranty) . Car kept breaking down to the point we are going 65 and it abruptly slows down and won't accelerate over 35. Cars had to swerve to miss us and the kids in the back. Not once but three times it broke down like this. 
     3 years and a lawsuit later I've moved on to Chevy.

I know my experience is my own. But I was VERY disappointed in the service provided by not only the dealership but corporate as well.
      Our concerns need to be taken seriously. When it comes to our families  and their lives,  nothing , and I repeat NOTHING ! will ever justify putting them in danger to save a little money on manufacturer/ dealers end."
4049, 2 years ago,4,My mother owns a ford suv model and it's pretty nice. Helping me be able to get from place to place with my son and being 6 months pregnant it's a great spacious car to drive. The gas is great with mileage. The stereo system is great it has booth wireless and you can hook your phone up to listen you your playlist it has a touchscreen monitor that's great with rapid touch response. Ford Motor Company
4050, 2 years ago,4,I have the hybrid and I really like it. The only thing I don't like is the engine seems really loud for a hybrid.
4051, 2 years ago,1,Horrible and dangerous car. Gas mileage is great and the car is very inexpensive. I was the car had more features. Very basic
4052,2 years ago,4,rent these frequently when we travel. easy to use four doors  and  good sized rear seat with when traveling with 2 carseats
4053,2 years ago,4,"I've rented a focus a couple times in my life. They're alright. A little cheapy, and the backup camera was crap, but other than that, it drove fine "
4054, 2 years ago,4,Good gas mileage. Great for a work car but definitely not a family car. Can fit passengers but not very comfortably. Interior is nice but a little cheap
4055, 2 years ago,4,For the price you can’t go wrong with affordability for the car. But I have heard a few things about Ford and I do not like the brand overall so I would not personally buy one.
4056, 2 years ago,5,"Live my truck, has all the bells and whistles...... have to support local....... buy domestic ..........."
4057, 2 years ago,3,"2010 #Fordfusion sport
Very sharp looking car! Bought it new was a good running car until about a yr ago! The car started to shake when you started it?? Took it to the ford dealer said theY fixed it yudayudayuda.. however a week later same problem! Ive had it in and out of the shop (ford shop) well its sitting in the garage unable to drive bc of all the issuse its having $2500 later & still not fixed!! NO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE VEHICLES!!"
4058,2 years ago,5,This is a nice car want to own one  day look like a very reliable car I would love to be riding in one weather is going to the grocery store or out on a date
4059, 2 years ago,4,"I live my Escape. It’s a 2014. For an SUV, I get pretty decent gas mileage, average 25 mpg. It drives well. I’m not much of a car person so this might not be the best review. However if you’re looking for dependable and want to stay on budget, this is a great choice. My only complaints: if you lose a key, it’s crazy expensive to get a new one; without the master key, you could get stuck in MyKey mode which limits speed and radio volume; and it’s not 4WD. Other than that I’m really happy with it!"
4060, 2 years ago,5,"While I like the Explorer better, this a great option for those not needing something as large."
4061, 2 years ago,5,Great full sized vehicle. Lots of space all around and wonderful features. Super comfortable.
4062, 2 years ago,5,"Having bought the car in March of 2018 and driven 15,000 miles , both highway and in town, we are still extremely pleased with its performance, comfort, and trouble free performance. The automatic (dct) transmission performs flawlessly. Acceleration in traffic is smooth and quick. MPG ranges from 36 to 38. We are satisfied Ford customers."
4063, 2 years ago,4,This is a large sedan. Visually spots could be better. Had a nice drive in it and the gas mileage was great
4064, 2 years ago,5,Love the ford escapes! Such a smooth ride and good on gas. I would definitely recommend.
4065, 2 years ago,3,This was a little small for my taste but it was a great car for the time that I drove it. Umm if you like a smaller vehicle it’s perfect it gets GREAT gas mileage. It’s quiet and it’s reliable it would serve great as a first car or for a student going off to school or as a commuter car.
4066, 2 years ago,5,I’ve only driven a newer model and it was a rental. It was great on gas it was quiet and it was enough space to carry what I needed. This car is very much affordable and stylish! I can’t say too much bad about it it’s reliable has tons of features and it looks great!
4067, 2 years ago,3,It is a cute car and gets you where you need to go. I haven’t driven a Ford but was the passenger in my friends car.
4068, 2 years ago,2,Small and comfortable car to be in.  good gas mileage convenient vehicle for an every day ride.  Not roomy
4069, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVE my Ford Escape!! I have a 2017. I had gotten into a car accident and as a rental, had a Ford Escape which pushed me to look into purchasing one because I loved it so much. It's perfect size and has all the bells and whistles I could need! Not the BEST on gas, but I really can't complain "
4070, 2 years ago,4,"It's a good vehicle but I dont know if it's because of where I purchased the vehicle or if it's the vehicle itself but the tires are always low. It could just be because of where I live there is a lot of pot holes and it's very cold here. I would reccomend to anyone who has enough money for parts, or I'd suggest you buy it new or from a good trustworthy place."
4071, 2 years ago,5,"My first car was a 2006 Ford Fusion and I loved it. It was a great first car and I think would be for any kid. Despite what people say about Fords, I thought it ran great and lasted me 7 years (I got it in 2013 and my parents had it before me). I just bought my first car over a year ago and gave it back to my parents and it's still running. It got great gas mileage and did everything I needed it to. Granted, the newer version(s) have a lot better features on them now so they probably run a lot better even now. Plus they aren't very expensive and I think are priced fairly for the quality. I'd recommend this car to anyone!"
4072, 2 years ago,5,"My mom purchased her Ford Escape about a year and a half ago and she loves it! She decided to downsize since my sister and I are all grown up now so she only has to lug around herself and her dog. It's a great size for a single person, but I do not think it is big enough to be a family car. My sister also purchased one a few years ago and it was way too small for her, her husband, and their two kids. It runs and drives great though and isn't too expensive. "
4073,2 years ago,5,"I love it! For the beginners it s the best car EVER! You can’t drive it so easily, it s pretty fast for start"
4074, 2 years ago,3,"Reliable, comfortable, long lasting, good travel car if well maintained, good on gas, can be expensive to fix depending on make and year, decent reliable vehicle"
4075, 2 years ago,3,"Mostly reliable, sporty, fun, somewhat realible, comfortable,  can be good on gas, if breaks down could be the end of that vehicle , expensive fixes, least reliable vehicle in my opinion, I would mostly recommend"
4076, 2 years ago,5,This car has done right by me I have it 5 years. And not a single problem. Runs smooth. Over all a great little sedan.
4077, 2 years ago,5,"Got this car with around 85,000 miles on it, and it was made in 2012. The car is amazing as it gets me from point A and point B with no issues. I have owned the car for over a year and have not had any major service issues. It has feature such as bluetooth audio and sync which make receiving calls on the road easier."
4078, 2 years ago,3,"I've had a lot of problems with this vehicle. It looks nice, but it's a mechanical nightmare. I've put about $5,000 into it, even with a warranty."
4079, 2 years ago,5,"My husband recently purchased this car and we love it. It’s a great size for a small family, and it’s super roomy and safe."
4080, 2 years ago,5,"I love my fusion. I have a 2012, so it is the last year of that body style which is the one I like. It also is the last year, so by the time mine came out Ford had already fixed all of the kinks. It is pretty reasonably priced and it is fair priced to fix! "
4081, 2 years ago,5,Love my Focus! Super reliable and great on gas! Also holds oil very well. Every time I go to get an oil change (every 5k miles) they tell me I really didn’t need to yet!
4082, 2 years ago,4,"I love my little car! It's my first car that I've owned, but not the first or even the best car I've ever driven. But it gets the job done. I feel like in the year and some change I've owned it, it's proven to be a tough car. There have been a few mechanical issues (I bought it used) that were easily worked through. The car can handle a lot"
4083, 2 years ago,4,I love the Ford F150 trucks. My mother owns one and it drives extremely smooth. I love sitting up so high when deiv2or in the passenger seat. We have had no issues with this truck. Sounds great too! I would recommend a Ford F150 as a truck to give a chance to own.
4084,2 years ago,5,"Voiture de très grande qualité a un prix raisonnable, idéale pour partir en vacance et idéale pour les jeunes conducteurs. Véhicule fort recommandable"
4085, 2 years ago,5,My first car when I turned 16 was a 1999 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer Limited Edition. It had light tan leather seats and a sun roof. The color was a silvery green with silver trim around the bottom of the car. It even had a key code so I would enter a 4 digit code to unlock my doors. I loved that car.
4086, 2 years ago,5,"This was my first car out of a concessionary, and I loved it so much, I could drive everywhere because its small but at the same time so many people use to fit comfortably on it that i think it gave the the best of both worlds!! PLus, its not an expensive car , so go for it"
4087, 2 years ago,5,Love my ride!! Wrecked once and the car kept me safe the car didn't get tore up either it was great! But this is a safer car on the market! I would buy one again! The price on them are fair.
4088, 2 years ago,3,It's okay. Haven't had it long enough to really say anything. Kind of old. Seems like a good car. Really pulls through. I'd recommend a buy if you're into ford cars. Go for it. I don't think you'll regret it. Cars a car. Definitely gets things done.
4089,2 years ago,5,The greatest car I have ever bin deriving  #lexus #astonmartin #bentley #prilaga #supercars #vw #volvo #fiat #chevrolet #cadilac #renault #dodge #tesla #skoda #rollsroyce #mitshubishi #jaguar #volkswagen #smartcar #mazda #opel #maserati #rangerover #suzuki #jeep #bugatti #hummer #citroen #smart #alpine
4090, 2 years ago,5,"My brother leased a Ford Fusion a few years ago, and I loved that car so much! It was insanely roomy with a very sleek interior, comfortable seats, and lots of leg room! It was a really great car for the price, and I miss when he had it! I would definitely purchase one of these cars."
4091, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my Ford Edge! It's roomy for it's size and the back can carry a ton! Mine is a 2011, and we gave been having a lot of electrical problems over the last 2 years. The backup camera went out a couple years ago. But overall we've had to have very little work done on it."
4092, 2 years ago,5,The escape is a great family SUV. Seats five comfortably with reasonably storage. My model had a sisterly opening back glass door as well as full hatch that made groceries easy to pack in.
4093, 2 years ago,5,"Nice car, somewhat spacious. Runs smoothly. Lasts forever! Great gas mileage!"
4094, 2 years ago,5,Cute car! Great for parallel parking.                                                 ￼
4095, 2 years ago,1,Worst brand EVER. Car had a transmission problem. Dealership denied it. Had a recall and lawsuits for the car but got nothing because it 2mwas a lease. Drove a car that was in and out of the shop for 3 years. Wouldn't ever recommend anyone ever lease or buy them. Not to mention the dealerships i dealt with had inappropriate sales people and unprofessional managers. Would recommend anyone avoid this brand as a whole.
4096, 2 years ago,5,The size was great for the room needed for kids and adults as passengers. Handles more like a car which is a plus!
4097, 2 years ago,4,Esta marca es muy buena y sus repuestos se consiguen mucho mas fácil y rápido en cualquier parte
4098, 2 years ago,5,"Ford fusions are nice cars. They are not only appealing to the eye, but my husband owns a 2014 and it has a lot of great features. Heated seats, bluetooth, adjustable seats with memory. My biggest complaint is how low to the ground they are, which makes them extremely susceptible to potholes."
4099, 2 years ago,5,"I own a 2014 Ford Escape and I absolutely love it. I like the look along with the features. It is nice cause it has a lot of room for groceries. I love to have a car that has heated seats, bluetooth, and the overall necessary functions.
I also like being a bigger car as I feel a bit saf Ford Escape er in it!"
4100, 2 years ago,5,"Loved driving and riding passenger in this car. Super smooth ride. Also, super comfy. I would love to buy one."
4101, 2 years ago,5,"This is a great little car. Yes, it is little, but is great for what we need it for. My husband travels a lot around town for work, so we wanted something that would be good on gas. This car has been perfect for his long trips and runs well! I would highly recommend this car"
4102, 2 years ago,5,"I love my escape! It’s great on gas and is very roomy. It is the greatest size SUV because it’s big enough to fit everything and everyone you need, but it also is small enough to parallel park in a city!"
4103, 2 years ago,1,Personally I did not like it I didn't like how it was made that see its I did like the look and all like just did not like it
4104, 2 years ago,5,"The Ford Fusion is a great family car. It has awesome gas mileage! It’s best for a family with smaller kiddos. Once the kids are older, there isn’t much leg room. I would recommend this car to anyone looking to save on gas and looking for a smaller family car."
4105, 2 years ago,4,I love my car. I couldn't have made a better choice. The Ford Sync option is the best and the Sirius XM Radio subscription is a bonus.
4106,2 years ago,5,"Carro popular de fácil direção, confortável e com uma direção macia e suave, gostoso mesmo que para viagens longas. Recomendo"
4107, 2 years ago,5,"My little car has been great. The luxuries are awesome, it is fully loaded and after owning it since 2015, I can honestly say it has given me few problems. It has tons of room, even for my family of four!"
4108, 2 years ago,1,I do not like my 2013 Ford Escape.  I have had issues with it since day one. Everything you can think of has gone wrong with it has.
4109, 2 years ago,4,"I used to own a Ford Escape. I really liked this car but unfortunately I only had a FWD model and needed 4x4. The technology in the Escape was great and the pickup with speed was awesome. I hated trading it in but again, I need 4x4."
4110, 2 years ago,4,"one of my favourite cars, I like the salon and the design of the car 😍 it doesnt need much fuel and offers you the best comfort"
4111, 2 years ago,5,Love my car. Best decision I’ve ever made. It drives nice and I’ve never had a problem with it. My back up camera helps so much and I love how sleek it looks. Keyless entry is a must have always once you have it you won’t want to live without it!
4112,2 years ago,5,Das Auto ist ein Traum sehr gemütlich und komfortabel einfach nur Traum es sieht nicht nur es ist auch Preislich perfekt.
4113, 2 years ago,5,"I often have to walk in the city, and this car is quite comfortable for the city, the ax is very good seats so that the driver does not get tired, it is quite comfortable and I feel safe in this car, by the way it is quite economical, and not only in the city It is also very good on long distances. To a person who is often on the road I really recommend this very good and comfortable car"
4114, 2 years ago,5,Our truck is the best truck I've ever owned. Roomy and terrific running. Looks nice while also being comfortable
4115,2 years ago,5,"Fusions are fantastic! We’ve had them in our family for a few years now. Very reliable, dependable and efficient. Comfortable and they include modern features."
4116, 2 years ago,3,"I am owning this car for two months. I like the interrior of this car and also its design, but its not quite economy and also has some troubles with transmission"
4117, 2 years ago,5,This is my boyfriend’s car. It’s a reliable car in my opinion. He got it used and it’s still going strong.
4118, 2 years ago,5,I love my Ford Fusion. It’s a 2016 so it’s pretty nice with the touch screen and Bluetooth
4119, 2 years ago,4,Love this car!! It’s great on gas and I’ve never had a problem with it! One thing is there have been a few recalls and I’ve had to go in and get that fixed but it’s not a problem
4120, 2 years ago,5,I love the for focus. So sad that they have stopped making Ford Focus. Still have mine in the driveway.
4121, 2 years ago,3,"The car is great on gas but honestly after 50,000 miles,  the car really starts to go downhill. I had nothing but issues towards the end of owning this car."
4122, 2 years ago,4,"My first car was a 2007 Ford Focus - just a little silver thing, and it fit me perfectly! I drove that thing to the ground. Fond memories of little babe! It was a very good first car, and the new versions look super nice"
4123, 2 years ago,5,Leased my Ford escape last year. Its the best car I've ever owned. Great on gas and is very roomy inside for it being a smaller SUV.
4124, 2 years ago,4,"Absolutley love our Ford F150 truck. It is roomy and comfortable for long trips. My only issue is the moon roof. Don't get me wrong I love it, but there are several known mechanicals issues and they have not come up with a decent and reasonable solution to the known promblem."
4125, 2 years ago,3,"I really like the back up camera, but the pedals are super touchy. It's my husband's car, so I don't drive it much,  but I don't really like driving it when I do. Its still a good car.. we got it from a dealership. It was pretty affordable. But I personally like SUVs better."
4126, 2 years ago,5,I love how this car drives. I also love how much storage it has! It'll be great for when my husband and I have kids. I honestly don't think I'll ever get a different kind of car. It's also perfect for long trips! I highly recommend buying an Escape!
4127, 2 years ago,5,"I drive a Ford flex. This vehicle has been absolutely amazing,! I have seating for 7! This vehicle has all the bells and whistles you could want in your vehicle! Seating through out provides plenty of leg room  for everyone"
4128,2 years ago,5,"I have owned a 15 plate 1.6 Diesel ￼focus for over a year now, it is a very good hatchback. It is easy big enough for a family of five as long as you don’t need car seats!!! If you have two car seats in the back you loose all hope of having a third person back there. The boot space is reasonable however it isn’t the biggest on the market, the body is also sculpted so it does eat into the space!!! ￼￼the mpg is reasonable and the ride is amazing. Overall it is a very good car and makes a golf family car"
4129, 2 years ago,3,"Not a Ford person at all so this is a totally biased review, my mother in law owned one of these and I used to drive it. The brakes were VERY touchy I didn't really care for the seats. They were uncomfortable."
4130, 2 years ago,5,"My brother owns a ford focus and he enjoys it very much. I have ridden in it several times and is very good on gas and a quick little vehicle. I personally wouldn't improve anything because I find it to be great. I would also recommend this vehicle as well, another great vehicle made by ford."
4131, 2 years ago,4,I trust drove one when I was looking for a new car. I drove a v6. It was nice but not my cup of tea. It was kinda momish. I liked the look of the inside though. It had leather and a sunroof but ultimately I got a mustang.
4132, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford escape. I purchased my escape when we had a child. It has so much room compared to what I use to have, the mustang, and it drives so smooth. I pay less for the escape a month then what I paid monthly for my mustang. I would highly recommend the escape to anyone looking for a very classy mom vehicle."
4133, 2 years ago,5,"I drive a mustang v6 pony package. It has leather seats, pony stripes,and a Bose 6 disc CD changer. It's my baby. Its charcoal gray with white stripes. I love my car. It sucks in snow but surprisingly not too bad on gas. Everybody loves to drive it. My fiance has tried to take it over several times.  My son learned how to drive in it and ended up buying one himself. But of course he had to get a v8 super charged."
4134, 2 years ago,4,We own a 2017 F250 four by four. Usually we are strictly Chevrolet people. But after driving our Ford for about a year now. I am very impressed. Parts are easy to find. And also replace by yourself. Low maintenance and high performance vehicle that we are very satisfied with.
4135, 2 years ago,4,"I grew up loving Ford! My entire family only owns ford cars and trucks. I love how reliable the cars are and they are affordable to all. They last a long time and I would reccomend ford to anyone looking for a new car. However, I do love my new jeep as well!"
4136, 2 years ago,5,My first purchase after college was a Ford Escape Titanium and it’s been an AMAZING first car! I’ve moved cross country and it’s still in amazing condition. Wear and tear is minimal for the average driver!
4137, 2 years ago,3,"One of my siblings has this car. It is a tiny gas saver. It looks cute and has nice features. The downside is that it’s small. My sibling is 6’ 3” and fits in the driver’s seat, surprisingly. This means there’s no room in the back behind him, essentially making the car a 3 person vehicle. However, if you’re not tall and are looking for a small, around town car this might be the one for you."
4138, 2 years ago,3,This car is pretty good. It was kinda small for me and I felt kinda crammed. But it drives smooth.
4139, 2 years ago,5,Love this car. I have had it for 13 years and it has held up. It gets great gas milage and it so easy to drive. Would definitely recommend this car.
4140, 2 years ago,5,Great a d reliable car company. I have a 2011 FordEdge and it's before the Bluetooth era which I really enjoy. I don't mind using the AUX plug. I definitely recommend this car maker.
4141, 2 years ago,2,Nice car but it seems like it is cheaply made. I don’t think it would last very long.
4142,2 years ago,5,I just recently upgraded from a 2008 ford fusion to a 2014. I loved my old fusion and I love the new one just as much. Not much I would even have to improve on honestly. I think these are pretty affordable cars and the up keep really isnt too terribly expensive. I would definetly recommend getting a Ford.
4143, 2 years ago,5,"Imagine a city the size of Glasgow. Now imagine every single person living in it driving around in the same car. Well, that gives you a fair idea how many people have bought a Ford Fiesta in Britain in the past decade. Yep, Ford's humble hatchback has been the country’s most popular car for years."
4144, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my fusion. I leased a 2016 and ended up purchasing 2019 because I loved it so much. The car rides smoothly, has all the updated technology, and I love Ford’s customer service. I couldn’t be happier with my vehicle."
4145, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. It feels very roomy and spacious but is still small enough to fit into small parking spaces . It is very comfortable
4146, 2 years ago,3,"This car was exciting in the beginning but I noticed the same problems happening in this car, that happened with my expedition with the door lock panel. I know now, it is a Ford issue."
4147,2 years ago,3,It's handles good and handles great on the back roses just needs more powers and lower suspension the suspension is too high and on some turns its feels as if itll flips its cheap to purchase and i understand why the quality is not very good
4148, 2 years ago,4,My dad and step mom bought one preowned and haven't had a lot of problems with it mechanically but there is a lot of road noise and it drives like a boat
4149,2 years ago,3,I'm not a Ford person but I have used a Ford Escape and it is a nice car with no major issues and plenty of room.
4150, 2 years ago,4,"Generic car. They're okay. Nothing too spectacular about it. Gets average mileage, not the best but not a gas guzzler."
4151,2 years ago,4,"I have the Ford Fiesta SE and it meets all my needs. It doesn't necessarily have the power or speed I'm used to, but for my lead foot, it's slowed me down quite a bit."
4152, 2 years ago,5,"I previously owned a Ford Focus and it served me well for many years! The compact style and good gas mileage won me over. When my son started driving, I was very comfortable handing over the keys ."
4153, 2 years ago,5,I have a Hybrid and I love the excellent gas mileage! I drive 40 miles round trip 5 days per week for work and I fill up every three weeks or so. I also get compliments on the expensive “look” of the body style...people are surprised to realize it’s a Ford!
4154,2 years ago,4,I loved this little car. Excellent for people without kids. I had it when I was single in college. We upgraded to an Edge once we had kids because we needed more space. It’s zippy and nice and comfortable to drive. Just not comfortable if you’re tall and have car seats behind you. Excellent fuel economy as well.
4155, 2 years ago,1,Too small for my needs and not enough room in back seat. I was disappointed in this case
4156, 2 years ago,5,"I love speed so if you are like me you better choose this car. Is perfect, have enough space inside. Awesome ❤️"
4157, 2 years ago,1,"My sister purchased a Ford Fiesta in 2013. Almost immediately the transmission started giving her trouble, and after dozen of trips to the dealer’s service department, my sister filed a lemon lawsuit. It was an unfortunate experience to have to ensure, especially with her first car."
4158, 2 years ago,5,I love love this car I have a 2009 have have donuts since 2010 bought it used has been im on the freeway a lot and get 18 miles per gallon in it.  It’s a great reliable car with lots of family space. We have been on plenty of trips in ours and pack lots of stuff in it. It’s a great family car everyday car with lots of space
4159, 2 years ago,5,My husband has always had a ford mustang. They are truly the most reliable cars ever. Never had any issues with it. Very luxe and very spacious. Great for road trips.
4160,2 years ago,4,My mum loves this car it’s her favourite she takes it every where would totally recommend if you want a car for your mother.
4161, 2 years ago,4,Great little car not my car but I drove it a couple times I drive truck so that is the only thing I don’t like is that it’s a car lol
4162,2 years ago,4,"My god mother has a Ford Escape and it’s excellent. It’s simple and easy, but has many great features that makes it perfect!"
4163, 2 years ago,4,I owned a 2014 Fusion and loved it just needed to upgrade for more room for carseats. Great gas mileage. Loved the touch screen and the stereo system. Rode smoothly.
4164, 2 years ago,5,"Super car! Resistance, beautiful and easy to maintain. It deserves all the money. It is my first car and it would be very difficult for me to break away from it."
4165, 2 years ago,5,"I own a Ford Fusion and from the day I purchased it, I love it!  I haven’t had many issues other than a recall or two.  Since I purchased my Ford Fusion I have had at least three people I know purchased one too and they all loved theirs as well.  Very pleased with my Ford Fusion."
4166, 2 years ago,3,"Not a bad car at all. Its on the small side. Great on gas! Parts are inexpensive. Has some electrical problems, like connecting to bluetooth. On really hot days it might take a few tries for the car to stay connected to the phone. And the screen behind the wheel can also be faded on hot days"
4167, 2 years ago,3,"The standard Ford Focus is pretty basic.  So basic its standard shift(SUCKS IN TRAFFIC), has automatic windows in the front, manual windows in the back amd has no fancy car options. I wish it atleast had automatic windows all around and bluetooth capabilities. I suggest getting all the good options when purchasing a Ford Focus. I do not suggest going used either. Too much money for what its worth."
4168,2 years ago,5,"Nice get up and go, without sacrificing gas mileage. I love the space, though the backseat is like 1 inch too narrow for my kiddos' car seats. I have taken it on road and camping trips, and I like the way it handles. I enjoy the dash arrangement and all of that. I just wish mine had come with a tow package"
4169, 2 years ago,5,It's a nice little car. It gets the best gas mileage ever! I enjoy driving it on long road trips. I would highly recommend it.
4170, 2 years ago,5,My best friend owns a Ford fusion and she absolutely loves it. When we take road trips together shes always the passenger and I take over the wheel. This vehicle is so smooth on the bumps along the way. It definitely drives very well. The interior is nice and gives you lots of seating room in the back. Lots of  leg room. The seats are amazing compared to my Chevy Cruze. There is an option for the lumbar support for your back that chevy didn't give me. Having back issues while driving can be terrible and very uncomfortable.
4171, 2 years ago,4,i dont like how the car looks but when you are a passenger it is quite a smooth journey
4172, 2 years ago,4,We have owned 2 different Fusions. My husband has a 2010 Fusion and I had a 2014 that I traded when I had children for something a little bigger. I prefer my husbands car over the one I had simply because I like the older body style. He has really had no issues with his vehicle 11 years after purchasing brand new.
4173, 2 years ago,4,Cute little car.  With cute little turbo sounds.   I’m small and would consider buying one.  Like how much leg room there is up front for such a little car.  I’m 5 ft tall and the back seat for me Insnt as comfortable.  So I’d hate to see someone really tall have to sit in the back.
4174, 2 years ago,5,"I love this  ar I have had nothing but ford vehicles all my life I have never had any problems with this car I bought it 5 months ago it is an eco boost and run great, good on gas. I got a really good deal on it. My son also owned one too. This is the second one I have owned and only trade my last one for a newer model."
4175, 2 years ago,5,"Escape from the everyday in this sporty, yet comfortable Ford Escape. Lots of leg room and head room. Plenty of trunk space. Not too intrusive but the perfect size for an afternoon cruise or a road trip. Take your Escape..."
4176, 2 years ago,4,"It's a good starter car. It's okay on gas on the highway but not so great if your just driving it around town. Keep in mind I live in a town where there is alot of hills and mountains so that is a factor to add in. 
I had some problems with the transmission of the car and took it in to find out a part was recalled. I am still trying to get that fixed. 
Otherwise it's a decent car if your looking for space this car is limited."
4177, 2 years ago,5,"Love my little Ford Ranger truck ❤️❤️. It's compact, easy to drive, great on gas and perfect for me. Wouldn't change anything about it and definitely will be a loyal customer of Ford."
4178, 2 years ago,5,Really useful and great on gas! Really spacious specially the XLT has the best interior accommodations! I truly would change it for anything else i love my ford! Totally recommend for anyone looking for an suv !
4179,2 years ago,5,Loved this car very good no problems & when it comes down to filling up your tank it’s very cheap
4180, 2 years ago,5,"My father in law has this car, it is a 9 seater including driver seat. The back seats are very comfortable and lean back. The seats can go down all the way for storage or moving purposes. I recommend this car"
4181, 2 years ago,5,Great car. This has held up well! Easy to drive and gets good gas mileage. Fits my kids well enough for a small car
4182,2 years ago,3,"I'm not a huge fan, honestly I only bought it because it was cheap at the time. I've had so many tiny parts break off recently. The inside handle broke off and I couldn't even get out of my car without rolling done my window. I get the part to repair it, only to find out it's a cheap piece of plastic..."
4183, 2 years ago,5,My best car yet! Drove it to California from Colorado and back it gave me no issues at all. Very affordable and reliable.
4184, 2 years ago,4,Runs smoothe and great on gas. Definitely a great company and car. Wouldn’t call it the safest for family
4185, 2 years ago,5,I love my escape. I purchased it in 2017 and still love it. I purchased it in white and updated to the sports package and so glad I did. Tons of space in the back seat and has a large trunk. Amazing car
4186, 2 years ago,5,"Honestly I love this car. I walked in to the dealership and said “I want the lowest payment, best warranty, and best gas mileage” this was the first car they brought out and without further shopping i bought it new. It’s versatile, dependable, and everything I needed."
4187, 2 years ago,4,"This has always been a great vehicle for me. Trustworthy, decent gas mileage, not super fancy but has everything you need for sure. Roomy enough but not too big! I would definitely recommend! Unless you want a luxury vehicle that is"
4188, 2 years ago,4,"This was my daughter first car. Great price, good gas mileage and a very safe car.  Would recommend this for anyone's first car or a commuter car."
4189, 2 years ago,5,"Ford Escape great car for the money. Very spacious, good gas mileage. Perfect car for my 25 year old daughter. She got 1.4% financing and its great that I don't have to worry about her."
4190, 2 years ago,5,"I own a 2006 Hybrid model, it is an older vehicle so it doesn't give me the great milage I used to get, but it is near and dear to my heart because it's such a great car.  It has never given me any problems and I'm not the first owner (or the second).  Parts are expensive but again, it has never broken down, so it's very well made.  I love my Escape."
4191, 2 years ago,4,"I drove the escape for a month while my SUV was being shipped while I moved across country. The Ford world - the build it equipped with a lot but then don’t charge a ton- it’s a great beast, I know a lot of folks who have loved their fords. I was super happy to get my SUV back but I think:
Great for short folks who need a lot of adjustability in seats and wheel and pedal, and doesn’t have really annoying blind spots that many of the more condensed SUVs do. It’s a great family vehicle. I personally plan to invest in my next vehicle for it to be something that will run for many many ages, and I doubt these have the life span and quality I want but if you want a great SUV that has lots of easy features and is affordable for a 2 year lease? This is your best friend."
4192,2 years ago,5,"I have had my 2007 for 13 years, it has been a wonderful family vehicle! Plenty of room for 5 people and large trunk/lift gate area. Very comfortable with great back support in the seats. Ford is typically a very affordable brand and I highly recommend."
4193,2 years ago,5,"#ford #f150 pick up truck is a great vehicle for work, home, and to take on fishing adventures. Dependable and great motor."
4194,2 years ago,4,So much room in the interior. Nice lifted driving allows you to see everything but since it's a compact SUV it's still really easy to park and fit in smaller spaces. Plenty of room for cargo esp bc back seats are removable. Lots of cup holders which everyone wants.
4195,2 years ago,4,"Nice, smooth driving. Good on gas, not cramped inside. Built in USB is practically worthless but I'm not sure if that is universal or a problem with mine. Heated seats are great."
4196, 2 years ago,5,I love my car!! It’s high tech  and cute! Feels luxurious with the price tag! ❤️ it has a ton of room and nice safety features and everything is well made.  Any mechanical issues I’ve had have been easy and no expensive to fix.
4197,2 years ago,4,"Reliable. Great space for big family, I can sit my three kids with no problem. Mechanic is good too . This is my third ford escape"
4198, 2 years ago,5,"My friend bought this car brand new 3 years ago, and I love it it’s perfect size for the city and also good for travelling. 100% recommended"
4199, 2 years ago,4,It was my first car. I loved it. I has many adventures with this car. It was so good as city streets also mountains. I recommended it. ❤️🤍
4200, 2 years ago,5,I love my car.  It's the perfect size for me and my business.  Low maintenance and cheaper parts.  I find it last longer than most other brands and keeps its value.  I also found that you can customize it fairly easily too!  I would recommend this to my friends
4201, 2 years ago,4,"I've been driving a Ford escape (different model years) for the last 5 years. Its been a tried and true car, and has always run well. Rating a 4 bc I personally want more backseat room. Also my lease doesn't have heater seats which I wish it did. Great car."
4202, 2 years ago,5,A bit small but enjoyable ride. Gets you where you want to go and I’m a reliable fashion.
4203, 2 years ago,5,Perfect car for me! I am in my early twenties and just graduated from college. This is the perfect car to get me where I need to be. Not to small but also not to big. I can carry everything I need in it. very reliable!
4204, 2 years ago,5,The Ford Escape has a lot of room and has you feeling trip ready. Great family vehicle.
4205, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car. This was the first brand new vehicle I’ve ever had. With 1.5 kids it was the perfect sized starter SUV. I will ride it until the wheels fall off. Never had any issues with it since 2016. Moonroof, auto gate lift, and navigation were the selling points for me. Looooove my car."
4206, 2 years ago,5,Love my Ford Escape. It drives great and has plenty of room without being too large. Gets pretty good gas mileage as well!
4207, 2 years ago,5,My 2014 ford focus is very everyday like car when you want to be on DL around town perfect for work and daily traveling and shopping is small so parking spots are a plus it fits most places
4208,2 years ago,4,It was nice and functional. My mother in law had basic model. Friend had a hatchback n I loved hers. But features meet price and you get what you pay for.
4209, 2 years ago,5,I love this SUV. It’s not to talk or long. You can fit a lot in it. Good on gas. Great turn radius. Nice and compact and drives very smooth.
4210, 2 years ago,4,2005 escape was a good vehicle had some recalls but I think all vehicles seem to these days. It's a decent SUV and affordable.
4211, 2 years ago,5,Best car ever. It is so good on gas gets 30 miles to the gallon it has all great fictions even Bluetooth its awesome yo drive I recommend
4212, 2 years ago,4,"I own a 2012 Ford Fiesta SE. It’s an automatic, silver hatchback. It has a moonroof, and the winter package (heated front seats, heated mirrors, rear defroster). Bluetooth, cruise control, AC, all the usual stuff. I really like the seats, mine has a blue accent/stitching! Other than the transmission....the car has been great. The clutches were replaced, so the car shifts differently...but doesn’t have issues like it used to. It gets me from point a to point b. Would I buy another one? NO. But, it’s paid off and I’m going to keep it until something does very wrong. Overall, not a bad car! I wish there was rear cup holders/arm rest and a center counsel. Other than that, it’s been great! I don’t drive a lot, I only have about 62,000 miles on it. I get about 27 mpg. I don’t do highway driving, only city and it’s usually a lot of stop and go & short drives (less than 20 mile drives)."
4213, 2 years ago,4,This was a pretty nice car. More compact than my Ford Escape that I currently own though
4214, 2 years ago,5,Overall I think this is a pretty good car! It gets good gas mileage and can get up there in speed a little bit. It’s also very spacious
4215, 2 years ago,3,"I own a Ford Edge... the whole reasonI bought this car, was I loved the panoramic sunroof. Ford uses plastic clips to hold this glass in place, and so many people have had these clips break, including me!! Ford will not stand behind their vehicle, and bad design and fix it!! Instead, they want to charge customers over 1,000.00 to fix..only to replace it with the same plastic clips, that will break!! Not happy at all, cannot use my sunroof at all!!"
4216, 2 years ago,5,"My mom has this car & I have drove & rode in it several times. Has plenty of room, drives smooth & is very comfortable."
4217, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVED this vehicle!!! Big and spacious. Great features, but like almost all SUVs they can be a bit pricey.  I don't know what they could do to improve this truck, other than possibly offering the XM-radio as a part of the car's sports package or ""standard equipment.""  I definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy!"
4218, 2 years ago,5,Not that I have favourites but I do love my ford gang always reliable and they are ideal for everyday life
4219, 2 years ago,5,I have a 2005 Ford Fiesta and I’m over the moon with him he’s got so much personalality never broken down on me always starts up first time even in the winter 😂 you can easily do cheap modifications the original speakers are on another level and even if he did go wrong parts are super cheap ideal first or family car big enough boot to fit shopping in :)
4220, 2 years ago,3,"The Ford Focus is one of those cars that probably had potential to be a really great car at some point but the manufacturers decided to cut some corners here and there and what we have is a result of that. The Focus my boyfriend owns is from 2003 and since he purchased it a few years back it has been a lemon. There have been problems on top of problems and thousands of dollars spent to fix those problems. Overall it has been a nightmare to say the least, but a shame because I can tell this could have been a great car if it were taken care of."
4221, 2 years ago,5,Love my car!! Had it for 8 years now and still going strong! Handles so well and super smooth ride. Had some issues with recalls but ford fixed them straight away with no issue. Would definitely get it again and recommend!
4222, 2 years ago,5,Very cute and small very feminine but I like big cats so I would personally wouldn’t get it but my cousin has one and there really nice and depending on the year it can be pricey but gas can last you for the longest very economical
4223, 2 years ago,5,Love traveling & nothing better then getting away. Love our Ford Fusion but definitely looking to get car #2 just for me and the kid/s mostly SUVS
4224, 2 years ago,5,"Me gusto mucho este vehículo si llego a tener la posibilidad podría ser que lo comprara, es comodo, confortable y no gasta mucha gasolina"
4225,2 years ago,5,"First off I have the Ford KUGA not this but as it it wasn’t on the list nor would it let me add it I just rolled with it. 
My KUGA is awesome!! I’m on my second one now (motability) so I had my first one a titanium x 2l turbo d I was so reluctant to see that go... it had served me so well.. it fitted my family, my wheelchair, the shopping , car seats... school bags everything at one and no one was squashed in.
With new great features such as heated seated, panoramic roof, in built full lcd screen to control everything... 
I love the version I have now.. another titanium x with full leather seats, heated seats, tinted windows and much much more x"
4226, 2 years ago,5,"Mustang wasn't on the list of vehicles to choose from, but the newer models are solid. Had a 2012 for a few years and it was amazing then, so I can only imagine what a 2020 model is like today. Like to go fast? This has your name on it! Just be careful when it's wet outside."
4227, 2 years ago,5,I currently drive a Ford F150 and absolutely love everything about it. They have been a great company to us and always provides great service. I have no complaints.
4228, 2 years ago,4,"My husband and I rented one of these while on vacation. The drive was smooth and there is adequate space inside. The passenger seat was comfortable and the overall driving experience was great; it has good handling and you don’t feel every little bump, which is nice."
4229,2 years ago,5,"Yaaazzz I just can say that I love it! I own a 2015 Ford Escape. Must confess that I was affraid of getting a jeep type vehicle but since the first time driving it I felt so confortable as if it was a car! It is really soft to drive, user friendly, good bluetooth and the original interior is cute tho!"
4230, 2 years ago,4,Love my fiesta! It’s so small and cute and it feels like I’m driving a race car. It’s also great on gas. Can’t give it 5 stars because it kicks back sometimes when driving as if it has a standard engine which is weird.
4231, 2 years ago,4,I had a 2012 focus and loved it. The only reason I got rid of it is because I moved to Alaska and saw a moose accident that shredded off the roof of the same type of car. The tech package in the titanium is worth it and I would recommend it.
4232,2 years ago,4,"Great fuel efficient first car! Was a blessing on the road, especially long trips. The only con was the space. You can fit 4 ppl conveniently but 5 is pushing it. The trunk however had quite a bigger space of room in it. And if you're moving, the head rests detach in back and the seats lay all the way down. We were able to fix a 55' Big screen in there! If you're looking for a nice ride that is excellent getting into tight places but won't make your pockets that way, a Ford Focus is the way to go!"
4233, 2 years ago,5,I loved this car . Seats are super comfortable.big screen to play music . Helps not use your phone . Has chargers in the back seat apart from chargers from the front making this car a family  friendly car
4234,2 years ago,5,High quality parts. Used various parts to upgrade Ford mustang including exhaust and racing springs with no issues!
4235, 2 years ago,5,Great SUV with tons of space...dont own one but have rented before and driven...love this vehicle. I'm a shopaholics so it's great for loading up all my purchased
4236, 2 years ago,3,"We got a 2002 Ford Focus back when it was new. It worked well for the first few years of ownership, but by the time I started driving, it was rather old and hadn't aged well. We had an issue with the car flooding if it was in the rain about 10-11 years after we purchased it. According to the repair shop, the only reason we hadn't earlier was because it was always parked in a garage before then; when I started driving and parking at my school, it started to fill with water on rainy days, as the lot was uncovered. We sold it soon after the estimate to repair the issue came in (it was too expensive to maintain the car)."
4237, 2 years ago,5,I've had my Ford explorer for 7 years and it is one of the best cars I have owned. Love it. If I get another car it will be a Ford.
4238, 2 years ago,3,"It's an ok car. I wanted to buy it before my first. But it didn't have many features I like on my current vehicle. It could come with it on a higher tier fiesta an ST when I wanted an Ambiente. Naaa. 
It's one of the affordable compact cars but just not for me. It's an awesome drive with a sexy schich look. But it has its people. I'm just not a fan. 
The ones that have been upgraded I haven't tried. My experience was over 5 years ago"
4239, 2 years ago,4,A little on the smaller side but has everything I need. The back seat is a little snug.
4240, 2 years ago,4,This vehicle drives well and is comfortable inside. It has nice features and is easy to drive. It handled ok in the snow and ice. Would’ve preferred something bigger with 4-wheel drive.
4241, 2 years ago,4,"In all honesty, I LOVE this car. It hasn't given me too many major issues and I've had it for about 4 years. There have been recalls on it and it does do a little stutter motion whenever I accelerate, but it's been doing this ever since I bought it and mechanics have told me it's ""just bad gas"". Overall, it gets me from Point A to Point B, and that's what really matters."
4242, 2 years ago,5,"Ford Escape is not only a quality vehicle, but also very appealing to the eye. Love the design and gas mileage! Great for long road trips"
4243, 2 years ago,4,"I had a 2011 ford fusion while in college. It was a car of the year... there was a manufacturers recall on something and it actually happened to me. Scariest moment of my life. My breaks went out on an upward hill, the only thing that saved me was my e-brake. Changed cars after 3 years.. not the best but not the worst."
4244, 2 years ago,5,"This is a Compact car, smooth ride! Easy to park. Comfortable to sit in, no leg room issues for me or my husband!"
4245, 2 years ago,5,"Bought this car for our expecting growing family!! Smooth ride, nice modern features, easy maintenance. Not bad for the price, good gas mileage"
4246,2 years ago,5,"The Ford Fusion is a very easy driving car, and it has been a joy since day 1 of ownership. The car has been ""bulletproof"" in reliability, needing nothing more than oil changes and scheduled maintenance. I think the interior is what surprises people the most. The leather padded dashboard and steering wheel coupled with diamond stiching looks very high end, for anyone who is looking for a stylish and just overall nice and reliable daily driver, this is it."
4247, 2 years ago,4,Amazing car. Price is affordable. Mileage is great. The overall look of the car is sleek. It's a lil cramp inside in the backseats. But overall perfect for work or just a quick weekend getaway.
4248, 2 years ago,5,"Sencillo tanto por fuera como por dentro, muy comodo, puede adaptarse a muchas personas que busquen un coche tamaño medio, de estética es normal y calidad precio esta muy bien. Lo recomiendo!"
4249,2 years ago,5,"Excelente coche cómodo para transitar en ciudad o carretera, interiores muy cómodos, además de ser cómodo al manejar"
4250, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love ford, i have my car for nearly fours years now and it hasn’t caused me any problems, it drive nicely I’ve got a 1 litre but with a turbo very inexpensive to fuel up and I only pay £20pound tax a year 😄 I love my car it’s my second focus"
4251,2 years ago,4,"Easy run around and good for a first car, insurance is inexpensive and young teenagers would be able to afford this"
4252, 2 years ago,5,"The best among all the cars I own @morningstarrentacar - 043979266, 050-4560539 #Dubai, it's got the extreme comfort at everything, driving is super smooth, just a wow car!!"
4253, 2 years ago,5,I LOVE my Ford Escape. My husband and I purchased it almost a year ago and we haven't had any issues what so ever.
4254, 2 years ago,5,"My first ""big girl"" purchase was a ford escape. man did i love my escape. Pros- remote start, heated seats, backup camera, keyless entry. I don't really have any cons. Gas mileage was great on it and it was roomy. I would buy another ford escape. "
4255, 2 years ago,4,Great on gas! Not a luxury car but it’s a fair price for sure for a first car or someone on a budget!!
4256, 2 years ago,4,We use our red Ford F250 for a work truck and a hunting truck.  We always rely on the 4x4 to get us to hunting camp in the fall.  It never fails us.
4257, 2 years ago,5,This car is a great gas saver you can go all over the city with $15 a week and it is fast and has great space for when you travel.
4258, 2 years ago,5,This is a really great car for the price. It has really good gas mileage. the only draw back is that for a 4 door car you do not have a lot of leg room.
4259, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely loved my Ford Escape, mine was a hybrid! It was a very comfortable vehicle. I used my ford to drive for Lyft and Uber. My kids and clients stated that the back seats were very roomy and comfortable during transportation. I would highly recommend this vehicle."
4260, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car there is no complaints it has been a good car for the 3 years that I've had it and it gets me to where I need to go no problems and it gets very good gas milage as well, the bill on it is also not bad as well and for anyone looking for a good car i would recommend!"
4261, 2 years ago,5,This is what my boyfriend drives and honestly it’s one of the best cars on the market. My mom drives a BMW and honestly there is zero difference in how this car feels versus the more expensive Beamer. I love the fusion and would buy one myself.
4262, 2 years ago,2,I didn't like driving this car because it was to small for me. The seats were not comfortable and my sister told me that hers is very hard to clean. There is not a lot of space in this car.
4263, 2 years ago,1,"Very uncomfortable car, the transmission feels like it bounced around alot. There isnt much room for passengers and also has a problem with burning batteries up"
4264, 2 years ago,3,"Unfortunately many 2014 Ford's have issues with transmission... To the point where there are recalls and extended warranties in place. Before spending on fixing it, do some research, might be under extended warranty. Very inconvenient"
4265, 2 years ago,4,I currently drive a 2006 Ford Fusion so it is a little out of date. But it still drive nicely. It's a very smooth drive that you can't even tell you're speeding until the cop lights go on behind you! My mom drives a newer version and the interior is beautiful and each model keeps getting better. 
4266, 2 years ago,5,"This was my favorite car I have ever owned. I love the feel of being in an SUV but it also didn't feel as large and bulky as something like the Ford Explorer, which drove like a tank. I think the new models are sleek and beautiful! I do not currently drive an Escape but I am counting down the days until I can purchase a new one. "
4267, 2 years ago,5,"This was my very first car! I absolutely loved it (even if it was short lived since I was an irresponsible teen). Despite the ditch that I took this car into, it kept myself and my other two passengers completely safe and walking away from what could have been a fatal accident. It drove smoothly and had lots of trunk/storage space. I adored this car and miss it dearly. "
4268, 2 years ago,3,horrible transmission issues . i will never in my life buy anything ford. i was beyond happy to get rid of it .
4269, 2 years ago,5,Cool car easy on gas very comfortable lots of legroom runs very quiet and drives very good for a small car it has plenty of room for people with long legs
4270, 2 years ago,5,"This car is the best choice if you live in the city or love to travel in the mountains! The Ford Escape is incredibly smooth, comfortable, sharp and sized right. Sync is a better and more complete driver-assist package than that offered by any other vehicle. I recommend it."
4271, 2 years ago,5,"So far so good, we havent had it long so I cant say too much about it yet, it's the newest car me or my husband have ever had. It's a 2014. Theres a ton of room inside compared to our vehicles we have had. The interior is really nice. Hopefully it will be as good of a car as it seems to be."
4272, 2 years ago,5,I have a 2005 ford escape. I've had it for about 4 almost 5 years and I absolutely love it. I've always liked the look of older escapes and it's the perfect size for my family. It's my daily driver and has given me minimal problems. It's not terrible on gas and gets me where I need to go.
4273, 2 years ago,4,This car is very similar to the Ford Focus but a little bit bigger and a little more luxurious. It has great gas milage and a very sleek look. This is a very comfortable car to ride in and I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an affordable modern vehicle.
4274, 2 years ago,4,"I love this car 😁
It gets great gas mileage and handles the road with no problem. Back in NY it handled the snow and ice without a second thought."
4275, 2 years ago,4,"This car is a very good starter car. It's very minimal and very basic. It's very compact with not that big of a back seat. I wouldn't suggest this as a good car for a road trip, as it might get a tad uncomfortable. It has good gas mileage and cheap upkeep though."
4276, 2 years ago,3,"This is the car I learned to drive in and it has done me well, the pros of this is that it is small engine for a learner to control but also have much space, it is and affordable car and ea6to maintain"
4277, 2 years ago,2,"We had this as a family car and none of us ever wanted to drive it. It always made weird noises or felt weird when it braked or started. It was a 2012 so maybe they have made improvements since then, but my family has all agreed that we will never buy Ford again."
4278, 2 years ago,3,"Not very roomy, but it's comfortable to drive. I just wish it would give a little elbow room lol I like my space and to be very comfortable driving, I'd most definitely would make it a little bit bigger, and yeah it's affordable and I'd recommend to Skinner folks"
4279, 2 years ago,5,"That’s my dream car actually, next car will be definetley Ford escape (hybrid). I love the light green colour especially. But will drive any of them. It has enough space for the family and at the same time, it does not require too much petrol."
4280, 2 years ago,5,I love my ford fusion. Its incredibly safe and has all the great extras that a person might want. It drives smooth and i have not had any problems with it at all. I would recommend a ford focus to anyone.
4281,2 years ago,5,"Hello! It's a great car. Not too big. Absolutely comfortable for woman. It's easy to parking with this one, which is my biggest problem. 😀 I recommended with two hands. Thank you to read my review. Follow me for more info from me. Cheers folks! :)"
4282, 2 years ago,2,"Sadly but true, I got a truck because I needed a bigger family car, and after a year just broke down, I wouldn’t recommend to get a Ford Car at All, there’s cheaper cars that you can trust."
4283, 2 years ago,1,I have owned two of these and I hated both of them. They were from different years. They are cheaply made and always need work done.
4284,2 years ago,5,"This car loved. With gas, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid powertrain options, the 2020 Fusion is where technology, style and responsible driving meet. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid options can help improve your vehicle’s efficiency and total driving range.* In all-electric mode, the plug-in hybrid can even reduce CO2 emissions, helping leave a smaller footprint."
4285, 2 years ago,4,"The model is so nice, it’s super reliable and gas wise it’s very convenient. Amazing family car, very specious with plenty of space in the trunk"
4286, 2 years ago,5,"I have been driving my Fusion for almost 6 months. I really love it, the options being provided by Ford. I totally love it because it’s too good on gas. Overall, You can say it’s a classy affordable car which you can flaunt infront of anyone ;)✌🏻"
4287, 2 years ago,5,"Love my car!!! I have a 2009 and she’s my baby. A super comfortable, affordable, and dependable vehicle."
4288, 2 years ago,3,"En realidad no me gusta mucho, se daña con facilidad. No es de mi agrado, es más el tiempo que está dañado que el que está bueno"
4289,2 years ago,4,"I just bought a used ford escape a month ago, so far I have noticed it is good on gas, easy to drive, has plenty of room for storage but wish it was a little wider to fit my three carseats in."
4290, 2 years ago,5,"My Ford Edge 2013 is the best SUV I have ever had. I love the interior, exterior, I live that the SUV is really powerful. If you have one of these one's you know that when you just touch the gas pedal just a little bit the car runs with a lot of power you won't noticed you're going fast!"
4291, 2 years ago,4,I've driven this car a couple times and I honestly didn't like the handling much. My moms rearview mirror literally melted off of the car's windshield and nothing is strong enough to reattach it. I don't really like the car as much as I've liked other models from that Brand.
4292, 2 years ago,5,"I've only driven this car once, but it was a very smooth ride. Its survived a crash, a drive by, and a boatload of coffee spilled inside and it's still doing what its supposed to! It wasn't badly priced and I think my sister likes it a lot. Would reccomend!"
4293, 2 years ago,5,"This car kept me alive in a horrible crash that put me into premature labor, I'm so thankful for its durability! (And remembering to use my seatbelt.) I quite enjoyed this car when my mom owned it, I would highly recommend. Its really just a good car."
4294, 2 years ago,3,I had one for 2 years - wish it had more pick-up to outrun aggressive drivers cutting me off. The model doesn't  seem to have presence on the road.
4295, 2 years ago,3,"It's a good car, but it could be more comfortable. A bit too basic for me - but I see quite a few of them on the road."
4296,2 years ago,5,Smooth driving. A lot of space. Very good in winter conditions and on bad pavement. Good vehicle overall according to my sister and aunt.
4297, 2 years ago,5,I love it! I like the feel of being up higher than a car and it handles well. Not quite as smooth of a ride as a car but that’s the only negative. Affordable.
4298, 2 years ago,3,My husband has a 2004 f150. I love it! It caught my attention when I first saw him. I have also always wanted an f150 since I was little. That and a jeep wrangler soft top.
4299,2 years ago,5,This is the best car it does not break easily and does not need constant service like Chevrolet the only con is the seats the seats are not really ment for slime loving kids  slime makes the seats hard when it dries
4300, 2 years ago,5,"My friend has a Ford escape. I like the speakers in it, and I like the controls. I feel like they do need more space for a SUV though."
4301, 2 years ago,1,"Had the 2011 version. 3 recalls later and tons of money spent on fixing it, I ended up trading it in for a lease. Got great gas mileage but tons of electrical issues. Literally so many different issues. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone ever."
4302, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutley love my Ford Fusion, havent had any issues with it. Luxurious for a reasonable price. Great gas mileage. Love the look."
4303, 2 years ago,4,Pretty good cars. My friend owns one. The interior is very nice and i like the big sunroof.
4304, 2 years ago,2,TERRIBLE CARS. They always have problems with the transmission and they over heat bad.
4305, 2 years ago,5,Really good cars! I normally do not like fords but these cars last awhile and are not bad at all
4306, 2 years ago,5,Very good on gas and reliable. I used my fusion for work and never had any issues with it prior to trading it in for an suv
4307, 2 years ago,5,I had to get a rental car when I hit a deer a few years ago and I was given a newer Ford Fusion. I loved the gas mileage it got which made driving 100 miles a day to work and back very affordable.
4308, 2 years ago,5,Our Ford Fusion is the best sedan we have owned. We have the Hybrid and can do alerrands around town barely using ANY gas. I wish it did hold a charge longer though. Ford vehicles are way more affordable than luxury vehicles but I really feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle when I'm in it. H
4309, 2 years ago,3,"I drive a reliable Ford F-150. It is a very great truck good work horse. The truck I have has a strong motor capable of pulling cars, boats, and other things. For my vehicle it is very affordable it’s very easy to make payments! I would definitely recommend my vehicle for anyone "
4310, 2 years ago,4,"Love my Ford Escape. Bought it brand new two years ago and I haven't had any problems. Black interior, bright blue exterior. Computer and speakers are the best part. Speedy little SUV."
4311, 2 years ago,5,"This car is the best around and ours has a hatchnack and it's a must have. Shore, city, long drives it's amazing!"
4312, 2 years ago,5,"Me and my husband bought it couple months ago , it is perfect for family . It’s so economy , and so comfortable car ."
4313,2 years ago,4,Definitely worth the investment! The way the car handles and how comfortable the car is when you are driving is absolutely amazing!
4314, 2 years ago,3,My first car was a Ford Focus wagon! It’s was super fun cruising around but it definitely has some issues and it was a waste
4315,2 years ago,4,I love the style of inside of a mustang. I had a 2009 mustangs convertible. I only wished it was a V8. The v6 engine was long lasting and gave me no problems. It was very reliable Mustang Ford Motor Company
4316, 2 years ago,5,Great car. Great on gas. I’ve had two fusions thus far. Thinking of getting another one when it’s time to buy another car.
4317, 2 years ago,4,It is comfortable. you can use it for a long journey because it consumes a small amount of gasoline. price is affordable.
4318, 2 years ago,5,"Me encanta esta gama de coche. Es amplia puedes irtes la playa con él y puedes hacer largos viajes, sus asientos son muy cómodos."
4319, 2 years ago,5,"I bought a 2015 ford escape, used in 2017. I love this car, has never had any major issues. The only issue I have ever had is the bluetooth not working sometimes."
4320, 2 years ago,5,"My mother has a Ford Fusion and so does my sister, they’re a pretty roomy and comfortable car"
4321, 2 years ago,5,"I have the Ford Focus Hatchback and I LOVE this car!! Great gas mileage!! Hands free capability, Sirius radio!! ￼"
4322, 2 years ago,4,"My husband bought me this car for my 40th birthday! I love almost everything about it. The size is perfect for my family. Heated seats, power everything.  Great gas mileage.  My only complaint is the Auto Off setting. I keep turning the thing off in my settings,  however, it keeps turning itself back on. It will shut the car off completely at a stoplight. Very annoying.  No mechanic, even Ford mechanics, seem to know how to fix it."
4323, 2 years ago,5,"Great on gas, very roomy. The gear shift is a dial instead of a stick when is very unique"
4324, 2 years ago,1,"The 2014 Ford focus is the biggest regret I've made. The transmission issues are nonstop, and Ford refuses to do anything about it."
4325, 2 years ago,4,"Specifically, I drive a 2015 titanium hatchback. It's coming up on four years since I've had it, and I've loved (almost) every second of it. This car has wonderful gas milage, which was an important factor for me, and has taken me on countless amounts of road trips with little manufacturing issues. It also rides like a dream. My primary issues with this is getting service done at the dealership; the employees at my particular one aren't always the most helpful or polite, but I have certain ones that I am able to request who always go above and beyond as much as they can for me. Most services I am able to get done at a third-party shop, but one of the most annoying is that battery services have to be done at the official ford  dealership due to it's placement. This is inconvenient considering the one I got it from is roughly ~45mins away from where I live. Back to the car itself, parts are relatively easy to find, and not the most expensive to replace. I anticipate being able to hold on to this for a while, which pleases me because I love my focus!"
4326, 2 years ago,5,esta fue la que más me gustó de todas las que he visto y si me encanta y me encanta y me encanta y me encanta y me canta solamente voy a decir que me encanta
4327, 2 years ago,5,Me encanta el carro se los recomiendo aparte ahorra mucho en gasolina y eso me ayuda bastante
4328, 2 years ago,5,Love the new and old escapes the new ones are clean and slick and new age nice interior and sterio system inside
4329, 2 years ago,4,I just recently bought a 2020 Ford Escape and so far I enjoy owning a compact suv. I dislike it doesn’t have a trunk pop button but has an automatic engine power button for when you stop and go which is incredibly annoying but I feel like all vehicles are going to these now 
4330, 2 years ago,4,This suv has a very spacious area inside. The bluetooth capabilities of it are outstanding. Especially when trying to be a safe driver and use the hands free applications
4331, 2 years ago,5,"I have owned a Ford Focus. It was a good car, decent priced , decent gas mileage . Overall I had a good experience with this car."
4332, 2 years ago,4,"I had one when they first came out in the 90’s(?) it was a decent car for a low price . Got good gas mileage, but that sucker was small !"
4333, 2 years ago,3,"Its a normal car used for different companies as work car... with a lot of space. I dont like a feature in the 2015 model, its a little uncomfortable as a driver,i dont have where to put my arm xp"
4334, 2 years ago,3,"Its a bit long and a little bit difficult to park in tirana ,especally to find a spot to park :/"
4335, 2 years ago,5,Great car for a student or a single adult. Awesome on gas mileage. Very reliable vehicle. Pretty cheap fix if something may need replacing.. Nice interior as well as exterior.
4336, 2 years ago,5,Love this car! So smooth. Has the best turning radius and i feel so safe and secure in it
4337,2 years ago,5,Great car for everyday driving. I use this a lot as rental cars and they get great mileage. The ride is very smooth and the car is quiet inside which is nice. Interior is simple and the backseat is roomy
4338, 2 years ago,4,"I loved my Ford Fusion! Mine lasted me 10+ years. I recently upgraded to an SUV, but I definitely miss my car. It got great gas mileage and was super comfortable. I wasn’t a huge fan of the body style, but overall it was a great vehicle."
4339, 2 years ago,3,Not the best for comfort or ride. Gets from point A to point B. Parts seem go quick and need replaced often. The body and paint also seems to dull out after a few years.
4340, 2 years ago,5,"For anyone under the age of 40, there has always been a Ford Fiesta. Such longevity confers on it the kind of rarefied status that makes a car synonymous with both the brand and its proclaimed values.
Certainly, the outgoing model – launched back in 2008 – has been not only the bedrock for Ford’s sales in Europe but also the prime conveyor of its ‘Feel the difference’ dynamism and peach-pretty exterior styling."
4341, 2 years ago,5,It honestly is an amazing car overall.. The engine is really powerful to be a middle class car. I like the style of it since it's a really modern car. My boyfriend has had it for years now and it works perfectly! Also something I really love is how powerful the music sounds!!
4342, 2 years ago,4,this car is a great every day driver. Plus it is a nice looking car inside and out. The gas mileage is excellent. No complaints really
4343, 2 years ago,2,"I don’t love ford, I feel like the car is about to break down any minute. I have had past issues with owning these cars and I will never get one again."
4344, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2007 Ford Fusion. It’s a good, reliable car. I bought mine from my grandpa."
4345, 2 years ago,5,"These are great cars, old and new. They are high up, but not too large. They ride very well. The new ones have a sleek design, and great electronics in the vehicle. They also come in great color choices. The Escape is also an affordable ride. I would highly recommend this car."
4346, 2 years ago,3,My experience with my Ford Escape has been a little rusty. I’ve had my car now for 6 years and I’ve replaced 90% of the parts in my car. I get 16 miles per gallon on a good day.
4347, 2 years ago,4,I drove this and it drove pretty good but I would never buy a ford. I've always had a lot of issues with fords on the road
4348, 2 years ago,5,I purchased a 2014 ford escape titanium about 3 months ago and absolutely love it. This was down size from my last suv. So I do miss the extra room I had in my Durango but this is perfect for what I currently need. We love to travel by driving so this is alittle nicer to fill up at the pump
4349, 2 years ago,3,I own an older version with a lot of miles on it. It is quite loud but gets me where i need to go. The details in the design are quite amazing.
4350, 2 years ago,5,My husband has an F150 and we love it. It's great for hauling and rides wonderfully on the road. He bought an Eco-boost and we have had no issues with it! 
4351, 2 years ago,3,"Nice car, nothing special about ir, just a nice car with a nice quality, not much else to say"
4352,2 years ago,4,So I’ve recently purchased this suv and it’s a great choice drives smooth not expensive
4353, 2 years ago,5,"I don’t own the car, I’ve only done a test drive and gone based off my friends that own an escape. It’s the perfect size if you have a little family, it gets good gas mileage and it’s not hard to park. The trunk on the one I saw was a little small compared to other vehicles similar to it, but overall it’s really nice."
4354, 2 years ago,5,This is the first car I used to learn how to drive and I found it easy and enjoyable to drive. Ford is a reliable car manufacturer and never had a problem with the Ford Focus. I like how the design is always simple but modern enough
4355, 2 years ago,4,"My 2013 Ford edge has had a few problems but nothing too major.  At one point the car would only blow hot air. Unfortunately this occurred in the middle of the summer.   A quick Google search revealed it was the blend door actuators. Although I'd taken it to Ford,  they did a system update and the issue still existed.  They did not fix the problem.  My boyfriend fixed it in an afternoon."
4356,2 years ago,4,I love the gas mileage on my car. I've had it since 2015 and the only problem I have is trying to keep it clean.
4357, 2 years ago,5,It's speed is so good and it's breaking handled is also very good it's very good to see and stylish also sits are very comfortable to sit
4358, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. I had a 2008 and drove it until 2019. We recently bought another one and I look forward to driving it for many years to come.
4359, 2 years ago,5,This car is my boyfriendz daily and I think its a great little car and very family friendly! We feel safe in it with our 2 year old! Very reliable!
4360, 2 years ago,5,"THis is by far my most favorite suv. When lockdown is over and I’m over my ocd from this pandemic, I’m getting this. In black... with seat protectors... to protect the inside from my children 🤣"
4361,2 years ago,5,"100% recommended a decent radio, super- slick shifting 5-speed, rear defroster, even came with floor mats & makeup mirrors. Three free oil changes from Ford & another free oil change from the dealer."
4362, 2 years ago,5,"It is my first SUV I love it! The style is lacking compared to other competitors, like the Hyundai Santa Fe but I really enjoy the comfort, the quick acceleration, and  maneuverability my whip has.  The ride is so comfortable especially having black leather heated seats which is great for my low back pain.  I agree that the inside panel could use some updating but it does have optional voice/touch navigation and ambient lighting with a variety of color choices. The cabin has plenty of room and it's easy to get in/out of. I did drive the 1.5L and it just didn't cut it, it seemed very resistive to acceleration. I test drove the Hyundai Santa Fe, Honda CRV, and Kia Sorento the styling and amenities were tempting (especially in the Santa Fe) but the comfort, quietness, and acceleration just didn't cut it for me. My only complaints are gas mileage (doesn't compare to my 2015 Hyundai Sonata) and that I have to remember to shut the idle button off because the vehicle will ""shut off"" to conserve gas and it's annoying when sitting at a stop light or the drive thru."
4363, 2 years ago,4,"So I have had a Ford Escape since graduating high school in 2006. I am currently on my second one and it is doing the job of getting me from point A to point B but I cannot wait to be able to afford something different. I have had the rear hatch break on both of my escapes as well as the tire sensor. Both of the Escapes are over 10 years old and still run just fine without any huge repairs needed but again, I can't wait to get something else."
4364, 2 years ago,5,"I love driving my moms Ford Escape! It handles extremely well, has a clear backup camera, and doesn’t have a problem connecting to my Bluetooth, which is big for me."
4365, 2 years ago,3,It was alright to drive I found it was a little small and cramped to drive or ride in
4366, 2 years ago,3,"I have Ford fiesta se 2014. It has a problem with the gearbox. When I change gears, the car shakes. It is very economical. Consumes a small amount of gasoline. The exterior tin of this car is very thin, so I have a sense of insecurity in it. It is good for those for whom fuel economy is important."
4367, 2 years ago,4,I loved my little Ford Focus. It got great gas mileage and was easy to maintain. The inside was easily cleaned and the upkeep was easy. Mostly the inside just needed wiped down and the plastic coverings on the inside were easily wiped off.
4368, 2 years ago,5,"An economical car, quite comfortable overall, sophisticated cabin and attractive visuals Ford Fusion #amazing #comfortable #economy"
4369, 2 years ago,1,This car was pushed on me as a last resort when my car died while I was working with Ford. It is tiny there are transmission issues (I constantly get sent recall notices but when I go the dealership tells me there is nothing) funny because I am having all the problems started in the recall... Oh well. Do not recommend
4370, 2 years ago,5,"I bought my 2004 Ford Expedition used from my aunt, in 2015. She bought it brand new and it only had 150,000 miles on it. Here it is, 2020 and it now has over 250,000 miles. It still runs! The only major repair I made was the transmission, but replacing that was still cheaper than buying a newer car, and honestly it lasted that long! Built Ford Tough, their motto, is true. I love my Expedition and as a family of 6, it works best for us, as far as room goes."
4371, 2 years ago,5,My favorite car ever!! Very roomy and great on gas. Rides very smooth and comfortable
4372, 2 years ago,2,"Love the way it looks but it has been a pain in the neck. Lots of recalls since we bought it, had a lot of work done and still not in good conditions. I wouldn't recommend this car at all. I can wait go change it for domething thst worths my money."
4373, 2 years ago,2,I'm not a big fan of fords because it seems like there's always a multi million problems that happen with fords. With that being said the newer fusion is actually not bad. Its comfortable and an easy ride. I still probably wouldn't buy one myself though
4374, 2 years ago,5,I owned a Mustang - the car of my dreams! Loved it but had to sell it after only 1 year because of a divorce.  I will own another one one day - soon!
4375, 2 years ago,5,It was a great vehicle with lots of room. The perfect size for me and my son and all of his buddies. My son and I traveled and made great memories with our Escape.
4376,2 years ago,4,Not roomy enough but a good car when I had it as a rental for a week. I would recommend it if you want a standard size sedan and like Ford.
4377, 2 years ago,3,"Really not a fan of this car. I’ve had mine for about 5 years and it’s been decently reliable, but the 6 speed transmission is faulty (which is why there is an ongoing lawsuit on this model and similar models). I’ve had multiple services to the transmission but still have issues with the gears shifting during acceleration. It gets good gas mileage... that’s the only redeeming quality."
4378, 2 years ago,5,I love my fusion for me its one of the best car ever i love the color i have its unique and stunning. Love how it work with me on daily basics i mean its a gas saver doednt take that much space.
4379,2 years ago,4,The new Ford Fusions are super comfortable and roomy. I like everything about it except for how low it sits to the ground.
4380,2 years ago,5,I love my Ford Escape. I drive it for business and personal use. I have leather seats and all wheel drive. It is roomy and comfortable for my clients and has no trouble driving mountain roads.
4381, 2 years ago,5,I have an 1998 Ford F-150.  I am a southern cajun girl and I wouldnt be caught dead in a car. This truck as been through everything I could throw at it and it's still running.
4382,2 years ago,3,I didn't drive this vehicle but when I was younger my mom had one and had nothing but problems with it ... I will probably never buy a FORD vehicle.
4383,2 years ago,3,Ik weet hier niet zo veel van maar is een mooie auto ik zelf heb nog geen rijbewijs dus hou me met auto’s nog niet bezig #fort #auto
4384,2 years ago,5,I loved the probability of the fusion. The colors I chose were really nice too but my favorite part was how smooth it was and how fast it was. Super safe for my family I would but again.
4385, 2 years ago,4,"This was a rental from when I had a car wreck. It was very reliable, great on gas mileage , but way too small. I liked the newer settings it had but would rather have something bigger. It also had the auto turn off at a red light but you could also turn it off."
4386, 2 years ago,5,"I love my focus! It's the most reliable, least problematic car I've had! My only complaints are very minor things that could have been added if my budget had been bigger at the time."
4387,2 years ago,5,Ford F150 and all the F series are really well made trucks. As far as the up keep on how often maintenance is needed it truly depends on the use of the vehicle. Ive seen F150 in excellent condition and not needing much other than the usual cahnge of oil etc because it was used to go to work and come back and ive seen bigger f series vehicles actually put in work like hauling that need new alignment sooner than it would. Very good trucks.
4388, 2 years ago,4,The vehicle is a smooth ride. Its not too big but not extremely small either. I wish it had a little more space due to all of my bags but concidering that i always keep it clean. The payments weren't outrageous and they were very manageable for a smaller SUV.
4389, 2 years ago,2,Not a ford fan! But this car ran literally until the wheels fell off! My sister has had two of them and they both lasted a long time.
4390, 2 years ago,5,This car is perfect!! My first car was a ford focus and it was everything I could ask for and more. It never let me down and it was very affordable for a first time car owner. I would highly recommend!
4391,2 years ago,5,"It a good car because you have a lot of different models for everyday driving, for going on a long trip, for racing. Ford have  good machines and you don’t have to be at mechanic all the time."
4392, 2 years ago,2,I had an Escape a few years ago and it wasn’t very reliable. I would usually ask for rides because I didn’t want to drive this vehicle. I wouldn’t recommend it to people who are looking into buying a new vehicle.
4393, 2 years ago,2,It doesn't handle driving well. It feels like the wind pushes it as you drive on the freeway. It is scary because it is already such a small car to begin with. This is a good vehicle for short traveling and not very often if you need to save gas. Other then that not for me.
4394, 2 years ago,4,I love my car but I have noticed with all Fords that they have somewhat of a delay when you go to accelerate. I'm not sure if that is intentional but it is pretty annoying. I love how the windows are I basically have zero blind spots and it's safer to drive then my focus was.
4395, 2 years ago,5,"Very nice car, super comfortable for the average person. Some may say it sits really low though."
4396,2 years ago,5,A very sporty suv great to take it to an adventure feels great driving it and its very comfortable as a passenger
4397, 2 years ago,5,This car has been amazing for me and my 3 kids.  Although i have 3 kids all in carseats.  I got it when i had two kids.. then the third came along and it became difficult to fit the 3 carseats without constant struggle. One of the features that is most important to me was the back up camera.  One other thing... if you get in a wreck... it costs a ton to fix damages.
4398, 2 years ago,5,I love my 2017 Ford Escape! My car has CarPlay and really nice speakers. I love the layout and the custom temperature controls on both sides of the vehicle. Very spacious
4399, 2 years ago,4,"Ford out did themselves with the redesign of the Escape. I was always a fan even with the late 90's and early 2000s design however Ford mixed size, design, technology and engine performance for a great price. I would recommend this vehicle for a entry size SUV with available AWD... especially helpful living in the Northeast"
4400, 2 years ago,5,"Bonne voiture , on est bien à l’aise dedans . De l’extérieur fait petite mais une fois à l’intérieur sa fait beaucoup plus grand"
4401, 2 years ago,3,This car is nice ONLY because it’s new but and up to date on all the bells and whistles but this car it’s extremely small and you do not feel safe in on especially when you are driving next to a Mack truck I wouldn’t recommend this car unless you like being scared when you get in a car and start to drive
4402,2 years ago,4,"My Ford fusion gets really good gas mileage. Easy and fun to drive. Easy to keep clean, easy to manage. My seats aren't the best in comfort, but everything else makes up for that part."
4403,2 years ago,5,It’s a very reliable vehicle and I use it on a daily basis. I love how big it is on the inside but still a compact vehicle. It is a very affordable vehicle if you’re looking for a compact suv. I would recommend this to any of my friends.
4404, 2 years ago,1,"Not my typical car I would drive but it is a smooth car to ride in, more like a mom car to me which I am not yet so maybe I’m the future"
4405, 2 years ago,5,My truck is good to run errands and easy to drive also really spacious from the inside my kids fit perfectly .
4406, 2 years ago,5,Stop it cuz I have to work in kind of helping us for dinner in one my aunt had one when I was like ten so about 7 or 8 years old and yeah yeah from where I remember it was super smooth and easy on gas and everything like that yeah I highly recommend it
4407, 2 years ago,5,My aunt has his car and she's had it for a long time and I love it in your eyes super smooth is great on gas and it's super technology advanced I believe her isn't she is a really nice car I highly recommend it
4408, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford Fusion! I have a Hybrid so it's amazing on gas. When I used to live down the street from my job I would fill my gas once a month. It's perfect for road trips. We've driven from Southern California to Vegas, San Francisco, and even Texas. It was pricey but totally worth it!"
4409, 2 years ago,3,It's a nice looking car in and out.. but it not the best car I've had it's good on gas but since I got it I had problems with it..I have a 2011 ford Taurus
4410, 2 years ago,5,Love how comfortable the seats are and this car is like a mini SUV. It’s not too big or too small
4411, 2 years ago,4,"Very surprised with the technology being a ford. I was disappointed when I order a push start car and the dealership gave me a key start one felt I over paid because of this. The ride is smooth. I'm proud to be driving a hybrid. At this time, everyone should be switching to some kind of hybrid or electric vehicle."
4412, 2 years ago,5,Road in this car once to go on a date out of town and I fell asleep in there the seats are very comfortable the air was very refreshing sound system my go-to was good so yeah I like it
4413, 2 years ago,5,I loved my Ford Focus! If I didn’t want an SUV then I would probably still have mine. It’s a nice little car. Trunk has a lot of room too!
4414,2 years ago,5,The car is really good. It’s good on gas and the ride is very smooth. Very modern car.
4415, 2 years ago,5,Excellent car with great gas mileage. Fairly spacious inside. I highly recommend the hybrid model because you save so much money on gas. 
4416, 2 years ago,2,Not impressed with Ford and their vehicles. They are not roomy and I am not a big fan of their looks.
4417, 2 years ago,2,I was not impressed with Ford and their service. I use to own a Fusion and my husband still owns a F-150
4418, 2 years ago,5,"I adored my ford escape. I had a 2009 and it was my first car. it lasted me until I graduated college and the only reason why I didn't keep driving it was because I got gifted another car and then my sister took it. It is still running today, it was such a good size- not to big but could fit 4 people and had ALOT of trunk room. "
4419, 2 years ago,4,"I used to own a ford escape which I adored. It was my first car and I had that thing until I graduated from college. I adore it- it was a perfect size, not too big but not super small. I had to get experience with that SUV. My father has an F150 and we love it. The inside is super nice and the red color it came in is sharp. "
4420, 2 years ago,4,As a passenger riding in this car I can say it was a smooth ride. I love the media center and the design of the car. I prefer SUVs but if I had to get an affordable car I would look into purchasing this. I love how easy it was to connect to my cell phone. I would recommend to others.
4421, 2 years ago,5,I had a Ford Fusion as a rental a few years ago & I absolutely loved it. I considered purchasing one but ended up getting something else.
4422,2 years ago,2,My car was recalled due to coolant backing up into the motor.  Pros it's a good vehicle.  Cons it's been recently recalled.  I don't know how I would improve it.  Affordable yes .
4423, 2 years ago,5,"Ford Motor Company 
Very comfortable car for all family ❤
For girls its Easy to drive👩‍🦰👩‍🦰 I recommend as this car as company 👌👌"
4424, 2 years ago,5,my dad drives a ford fusion and i’ve used it a few times. i really enjoy it and it is a great quality car
4425, 2 years ago,3,This car wasnt large 3enough for my needs but it was nice on the inside and would be perfect for somebody who didnt need to put carseats in the back and tote around a bunch of childs stuff. Sleek and pretty on the outside!
4426, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car! I lease it and it is the first nice and new car I've had. The model I have only has a small screen which I do wish it was bigger but that's okay. Very affordable car, good on gas, and I love that it shows how many miles until empty"
4427, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape! My family has always been a Ford family, so I grew up driving Fords. My Cord Escape is my favorite car I’ve ever driven and I wouldn’t trade it!"
4428, 2 years ago,5,I just bought my car a year and a half ago and I’m absolutely in love with it. Ford has been a very trustworthy company for me and I will recommend fords to all of my friends and family.
4429, 2 years ago,2,Bought this car because it had all the whistle and bells but every month seems to be some other issue.
4430,2 years ago,5,"Overall, the car had comfy seats and the drive went well. No issues. I would probably buy one if I could. Loved being a passenger!"
4431,2 years ago,5,"My fiance before we got married actually bought me a ford escape, at first I was thankful but not too excited... I ended up LOVING the car! So much space and such great features !"
4432, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car! Its got a lot of pepper, and it's a fun smooth drive. It's also not very expensive to maintain, my last service bill was pretty low for what I had done. It may not be for everyone, but it's a good one."
4433, 2 years ago,5,My father had a Ford Focus.It was really good car.He never had any really big problems with it.They are nice looking cars.
4434, 2 years ago,5,Drives smooth. Seating is comfortable and spacious. Didn’t drive it much it was confortable though.
4435, 2 years ago,4,Love this car is modern and up to date. The look is awesome as well with the new models. And I also love the brand which is Ford.
4436, 2 years ago,4,My Ford Escape is my daily driver! Plenty of leg room in the front while the other passengers in the back have leg space as well. This is a neat little car for the money. Id like something a little bigger but it serves it purpose for now. My escape has cloth seats which don't work out very well with two kids and a dog. Perhaps that isn't always the best option.
4437, 2 years ago,5,"Great handling car, awesome acceleration and all around a great spacious car, i would highly recommend this vehicle."
4438,2 years ago,3,This car is good for a teen. The acceleration isn't great and it has a pretty small interior. I have a car seat in the back and I can only fit one more person back there. The car seat also means less space for whoever is sitting directly in front of it. I'm really short at 5 ft so it's manageable for me but not so much for anyone else. Definitely not a family car
4439, 2 years ago,1,"My wife had a Focus sport. The transmission went out at 8,500 miles. It was worth about half of the sticker price when she drove it off the lot. It was a money pit."
4440, 2 years ago,5,The FORD Escape has always been my favorite small SUV. I love how small it is while still having plenty of room on the inside. 
4441, 2 years ago,5,I had a Ford Fiesta for two years before I switched to a truck and I loved it ! It was small but still seemed to have plenty of room on the inside and was great on gas. 
4442, 2 years ago,4,Love the fuel mileage. Seats are a little rough on the behind on long trips. Drives and handles great for what it is. Overall ive been happy with it for the 3 and a half years I've owned it
4443, 2 years ago,4,Bought the top end model and the heated seats are nice and remote start is handy on cold days but beyond that it's just a daily that gets good gas mileage. Hopefully won't have problems with the auto manual transmission.
4444, 2 years ago,5,I love Ford!!I purchased a 2003 Ford Escape and it is still on the road. It's not the prettiest thing but it runs great!
4445, 2 years ago,5,"This is a nice car , I am doing my driving lessons with it and I like it , good looking"
4446, 2 years ago,5,Lovely car. My mother drives in this car and she has it almost 10 years and she never had a big problem with the car
4447,2 years ago,4,I took this car for a test drive..brand new. I overall loved the look and interior however it just was not for me. It gave me rent a car vibes. Although very affordable and drove great it just was not for me. I would reccomend this to maybe a first car for someone.
4448,2 years ago,3,"not a big fan of the colour selection, uncomfortable seats, inside the car gets a little too warm in summer. would improve by adding more colours, too expensive for what it is. wouldn’t recommend for tall people."
4449, 2 years ago,5,"what I can say, it is just amazing, comfortable, there are no words that describe it. 😱😱only such kind of smiles are proper ."
4450, 2 years ago,5,Best car for younger adults my second oldest sister had one we loved going all over town in it it drives amazing
4451, 2 years ago,5,Its great i love ford i have a ford explorer but my mom has this one and loves it all fords are amazing they are the best cars for kids i think so if you are looking get this
4452, 2 years ago,5,"My coach has this exact car. We used to drive long distance from state to state so it was very important for me to be in a comfortable car. This one is so good for that! Its so smooth, comfortable to be in! I totally recommend it"
4453, 2 years ago,5,I think this is a great running car. My friend owned one and it was very reliable. I Would for sure recommend! They have cool colors too.
4454, 2 years ago,4,"A friend of mine owns this model of Ford.  It was okay, it drove well and it was comfortable, but it was not really the best when it came to maintenance.  "
4455, 2 years ago,4,"We have owned this truck for many years.  We have had no issues, except regular maintenance
This truck seems like it will run forever plus if there is a problem my husband can get into it and fix most problems."
4456, 2 years ago,5,I love my husband's 2016 F150. I always feel like a badass driving it and I love the features. Has some really nice creature comforts. Leather seats and wood grain have always caught my eye. Plus I love the adjustable pedals. Great for short ladies like myself.
4457, 2 years ago,5,"I drive a Ford Fusion Hybrid and it's so quiet. You can't even notice the car is on. I love it. The mpg is around 35 which is fantastic. Takes around $30 to fill up, depending on where you're at but ya can't beat it. Great first car, great daily driver, oh and great car to drive with uber/lyft in. Barely any issues. Highly recommend this car. "
4458, 2 years ago,4,It rides smooth. Too big for my taste. Looks great in the inside. Nice smooth leather. Not great on milage.
4459, 2 years ago,4,"i had a 2014, drives great and nice leather interior for a low great price tag. pretty simple and basic car but it looks nice and is a good size. "
4460, 2 years ago,5,"I love my little fiesta! I’m a very small person so the size of the car doesn’t bother me at all, I can’t have super tall people in my car though, they just don’t fit! It’s not a tiny car but it’s probably the smallest a sedan can get while still being normal. All the features are awesome and I’ve had zero issues in the 3 years I’ve had it."
4461, 2 years ago,5,The Ford Fusions are beautiful cars. They're nice and roomy. They don't have the same transmission issue that the Focus has. They're wonderful on gas and they ride really smooth. My aunt loves her Fusion and shes had it for years. They definitely last.
4462, 2 years ago,3,"I love Fords and grew up in a Ford family. My first car was a Focus and it ran great, but the newer ones have some issues. I just recently sold my newer one and ended up going with a Toyota. They have transmission issues that they really need to work on."
4463,2 years ago,5,"I own a Ford F150, a pretty old pickup but it's a very solid vehicle. Minor issues with brakes,  but fixed easily,  otherwise I had no problems with it"
4464, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVE my mustang, not so much the new designs they have came out for eco boost but the older styles are my favorites and no other car(apart from supercar) can top it."
4465, 2 years ago,4,"This car handles well in the suburbs, it is not the best in winter. It is surprisingly roomy and a great first car for a new driver. There is great trunk space and cool features like mood lights. The best feature of all is that it is excellent on fuel! Depending on your location and commute, $10-$20 will fuel your tank and you only have to refuel once every two weeks."
4466, 2 years ago,5,Good car. Specious. Drives nice. Maintenance is not so expensive. Details are good.
4467,2 years ago,4,Was a decent reliable car. Was comfortable from the passengers perspective. Small but good gas saver The Hatchback makes groceries a breeze when I go with my hubby.
4468, 2 years ago,5,This is a great car. It gets great gas mileage and is dependable. I would highly recommend it to everyone
4469, 2 years ago,5,I love my fusion! I haven’t had any issues with it. I have can my car for about a year and a half and love it.
4470, 2 years ago,5,This car is soo cheap to run. So efficient hardly spend any money on fuel. I love the colour way. I wouldn’t improve anything. It’s one of the best if not the best car for its price. Must buy if looks for a small engine car
4471, 2 years ago,5,Good good. Had the car for 1 year nothing wrong. Gets me from a to b with no problem. I only use 30 pound of fuel each week.good price. Very affordable. I would recommend this car to anyone. Soon going to buy a newer one.
4472, 2 years ago,5,"Love this vehicle. My grandma owns it, and she’s never had an issue with it. Very roomy, lots of advanced features."
4473, 2 years ago,5,"The Ford Focus is a pretty reliable car I’d say. It’s decently small, but roomy. Good on gas mileage."
4474, 2 years ago,3,"The Mustang GT is one of a kind when it comes to power. Handles well, but the backseat is not easily accessible. A hidden their door for the back seat. Mid range pricing makes it affordable."
4475, 2 years ago,5,"people this car really deserves a great comfortable luxury neat trim Of course if you keep it fast it doesn't break easily and car parts are pretty cheap I think it's worth buying it Because this car is a real boom, it picks up speed and is really cool"
4476,2 years ago,1,It was trash.this thing broke down and me and the dealership guy were stranded in the middle of nowhere.
4477, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Fusion and will drive it until it won’t run anymore. It’s sleek, good on gas and it’s great in almost all weather conditions. I have the sport model and I love that it takes almost no effort to go from 0-60."
4478, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford Focus is a great car but I had a bad experience only because I bought mine used and the person didn’t take care of the vehicle. It was very reliable, until it wasn’t obviously. It doesn’t do well in snow at all but is great on gas."
4479, 2 years ago,5,Muito bom para dirigir adquirir um deste carro no futuro para ter meu proprio carro já que eu uso é do meu pai
4480,2 years ago,5,"Pequeño pero con suficiente espacio, económico, comodo, no da mucho problema, es moderno. Los asientos traseros son algo reducidos, así que deben considerar eso."
4481, 2 years ago,4,"Easy to use, affordable and perfect for families. I would highly recommend this one , especially if you’re a new driver."
4482, 2 years ago,3,"I love everything about my car EXCEPT the consistent recalls and transmission issues. I have so many problems with it, it’s frustrating."
4483, 2 years ago,4,"Roomy, great for family vehicle. This vehicle will take a lot and still keep on truckin'. Good price point as well"
4484, 2 years ago,3,"Fords are not my favorite. They're just kinda meh in my personal experience. I've owned one when younger and had many issues with it. I've also had family members that have had ongoing issues/low quality experiences with them. I will say though that these things happened years ago, so new Fords could be better. Idk."
4485, 2 years ago,5,The Ford EDGE is wonderful.  Lots of leg room so either of you are short or tall it works for everyone. Lots of space in the car for almost everything.
4486, 2 years ago,3,"i likes my car in the beginning. had great mileage and it was reliable. coincidentally, as soon as i decided i was ready to upgrade, the car just began to fall apart. i had diagnostics ran and they couldn’t find the cause of the issue. glad i got rid of it."
4487, 2 years ago,5,I honestly love my Ford Focus.  I have had it for almost four years now.  I've never really had a problem with this car.  The only thing that can be bothersome is there can be quite a few recalls on parts.  Would definitely recommend
4488, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car, a Ford Focus gets really good gas mileage. I’ve never had a problem with mine. I wish it was a 4 door. It is very reliable and I bought mine second hand so it was very affordable. I recommend to people that drive frequently."
4489, 2 years ago,3,Not my favorite car to be honest. I got in a car accident before my Jetta and literally the car is so small I feel like my whole car was totaled! The car is so small it's hard to have multiple passengers in the vehicle. THE GREAT PART is that it did automatically call 911 after I got into the accident without me even knowing. 
4490, 2 years ago,5,great gas mileage which helps a lot and is very affordable. Very much worth the money. I loved driving this car it felt great on the road and it was great in the snow!
4491, 2 years ago,5,my sister owns this car and she loves it! it gets great gas mileage and is so cute! its awesome having her own car and loves this one
4492,2 years ago,5,Este ainda não testei mas gostaria muito de ter um para poder ir trabalhar e nas horas vagas trabalhar de motorista de aplicativo
4493,2 years ago,4,Great dependable car! Accelerates quickly and has a lot of room so it doesn’t feel cramped
4494, 2 years ago,5,My dad has this car. When I was in high school he use to let me drive it. It’s a really nice car that lasts for a long time !
4495, 2 years ago,4,I purchased a 2018 Ford Echosport and I enjoy it. Not my favorite in looks but is AWD. It is medium in size and automatic. I feel like it is a very good car for the money. I would recommend it.
4496, 2 years ago,4,"It really has great mileage, $25 can get me to and from work for two and a half weeks, and as someone who can only work part time due to being a student, I really appreciate that.  The sound system is great, and I can just connect my phone and listen to spotify"
4497, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. It has been a great car with regular maintenance. It’s a good every day car. And it’s a good road trip car as well.
4498, 2 years ago,5,I love my 2017 Ford Fiesta! Fantastic gas mileage. Can feel a little small at times but the trunk is surprisingly roomy. I’m able to fit 2 car seats in the back comfortably but a third person wouldn’t fit back there with them.
4499, 2 years ago,3,This was an okay vehicle I prefer an escape though because I dont like driving cars. I hope this is helpful although many people have their own preferences
4500, 2 years ago,5,Love this car! I would recommend to anyone. Best vehicle I have owned. 2014 Ford escape! Love it! I think anyone else would love it too since it has ran amazing and was affordable!
4501, 2 years ago,5,"My sister owns a ford focus and besides being a small car which is not my taste the car is actually really nice. It drives smooth, has very little mechanical issues, and it is great on gas mileage. "
4502, 2 years ago,4,"Good little car, although I dont like fords but if your looking for a good comfy car with good gas mileage this is it."
4503, 2 years ago,5,"Many of you have been asking me lately, how many cars I have driven!!! Actually, to be real, I haven’t driven many!!! But I really fell in love with this one! It’s a cheap and cute, affordable one!!!! Love it!"
4504, 2 years ago,5,"Many of my close friends have had the same model cars just like me.... A friend of mine have actually gotten the exact same as me, just in an other color!!! Really affordable but expensive, really good tho!"
4505, 2 years ago,5,"Since a baby I always wanted a Jeep! I finally got to get my first one by the age of 16!!!!! I am really glad I got this model, it’s white and so so affordable! It is very expensive but I would definitely recommend it!!!"
4506, 2 years ago,4,I've owned 2 ford escape's. Mine had a sunroof and a rear glass hatch. Perfect for my traveling and adventures
4507,2 years ago,3,"Personally I didn’t like this car so much. Pro: saves gas, it’s not expensive when it comes to fix it, it’s modern, comfortable. Cons: If you get into an accident feels that you have no protection, car feels like made with plastic, at least for me that’s the first and most important thing when gettin a car."
4508,2 years ago,5,Looks great on the inside. Nice interior. This car will get up to speed in a very quick manner. You do sit low to the ground
4509, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford focus, it is great.  Doesn't take alot of gas, so that's a plus. Pro is the gas mileage. Con is I have an older model so it needs a few things"
4510, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Escape! It looks great both inside and out, it's easy to drive, and has great gas mileage. I prefer small SUVs and the Escape is perfect for me. "
4511, 2 years ago,5,"Great sedan. Lots of options including eco-charging. Run on battery power, when battery has power. Generating power occurs by driving the vehicle or charging the battery  from an electrical outlet.  Other options I've used are heated seats, auto air, SiriusXM's radio for 6mths. Great car, great gas mileage. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a sedan. Ford Fusion"
4512, 2 years ago,4,This car is a cute little first car. Itd be good for a college student. It doesnt have a whole lot of space but its enough. Wouldnt recommend for a family of 4+
4513, 2 years ago,3,I have this car at the moment. It's nice inside but it has a lot of blind spots. It's so much bigger than it looks and that makes it hard when parking or backing out of a parking spot. It's also very low to the ground and seems to scrape a lot of things.
4514,2 years ago,5,I personally owned a 2006 Ford Fusion is a cute little car and is very roomie I loved it was a great car good on gas
4515, 2 years ago,4,I honestly hate this car but it gets me from point a to point b with minor problems however ford shouldn't have made cars witha. Double clutch automatic.
4516, 2 years ago,3,"I've been in the passenger seat of this car and besides how my best friend drove the car was absolutely lovely. Drove sweet, quality dash design, very good on has and the seat were comfy, lost of leg room for everybody. Her car was in red tho not blue."
4517,2 years ago,5,I used to drive a Ford Fusion very regularly. It rides so smooth and so nice and I was sad that I don't have it to drive anymore! The one that I would drive was a 2011 and it was amazing! I would go back to it if I could! the only thing I wish it had at the time... was a rearview camera. besides that it was perfect
4518,2 years ago,4,I love how the Ford Escape rides. Some mini suvs make you feel like youre just bouncy or jerking back and forth but this one doesn't do this!
4519, 2 years ago,4,I'd rather live with my mom she on that car back in the day and striped Brandy I just drove and drove around there. Went very nice and I love this great
4520, 2 years ago,3,August 29th I just drove one for about a week or so I like it's not that big of a deal but it's a nice little car and
4521, 2 years ago,5,I wish i had a car like this which can be affordable on gas to go to work and easy to use and its not that big wich is great.
4522, 2 years ago,5,"My 2010 Ford Fusion was purchased a little over a year ago used of course, but every since day one we have had no problems whatsoever. It gets very good gas mileage and has lots of trunk space. For someone with my credit line it is somewhat affordable."
4523, 2 years ago,5,I had an escape as a loaner and was very impressed with the comfort in the seats. They had added lumbar support that can be adjusted. The gas mileage was great and had a lot of pep in it.
4524, 2 years ago,5,My mom has a newer model and she loves it! She loves all the features! I know she highly recommends this car.
4525,2 years ago,2,When I drove a 2013 it was not a very reliable car. Had a few issues that seemed to be persistent.
4526, 2 years ago,5,The new escapes have everything to fashion and comfort. These cars are so high tech and spacious. I love the new look and the interior is just amazing!
4527, 2 years ago,4,It doesn't accelerate well. I need to bring in it because of a recall. I like the leather seats and gas mileage.
4528, 2 years ago,4,"I like my car, It gets goof gas mileage and it is all wheel drive. I drive a 2013 ford fusion titanium and the only problems I have with it is that the sensors seem to be a little touchy. The place that I got it from charged me a little extra for what I got but I love my car."
4529, 2 years ago,5,Super smooth ride and spacious enough for me and 4 kids/ preteens. Love how fuel efficient it was and fun to drive!
4530,2 years ago,5,"An amazing first car. Little to no problems throughout the 5 years I had it! Really love how small it is, would like It a bit taller. Very affordable!"
4531, 2 years ago,3,"wasted! Are good cars and I definitely like them but I've heard a lot about the engines having issues and going out requiring replacement. I'd consider buying, but wouldn't shop without a mechanic."
4532, 2 years ago,4,"Fun to drive, comfortable, easy controls. Definitely a great way to travel! You can easily carry the kids with you and everything you need. Great shopping room. Very easy to see why it's so highly rasted!"
4533, 2 years ago,5,"Me parece que es una SUV bastante completa, la verdad es muy cómoda, tiene una muy buena motorización, tiene una buena altura con respeto al piso y su interior es bastante tecnologico, la verdad me gusto bastante, considero con Ford ofrece muy buenos acabados en su interior y mucha tecnologia, lo cual es muy importante hoy en dia!"
4534, 2 years ago,4,"Considero que para el segmento donde se encuentra este vehiculo, cuenta con una excelnte calidad de construccion y ofrece demasiada seguiridad pasiva y activa para los ocupantes, ademas de que es bastante comodo, solo considero que es un poco estrecho, no es muy amplio, pero no esta pensado para eso, su objetivo es moverte muy seguro y confiable de un punto A a un punto B!"
4535, 2 years ago,4,I have an older model escape that I used throughout college! I loved it because the seats folded down flat and it was easy to transport dogs and people. The under belly did rust a lot and the exhaust ended up separating.
4536, 2 years ago,4,My friend recently bought this car it is nice and good for daily travel throughout the city. Really comfortable!
4537,2 years ago,5,I love my car. I have had zero problems with it and the mileage is outstanding. Drives perfectly and I plan to drive it until it dies.
4538, 2 years ago,5,My moms car is a ford and she loves that brand. Even when she had to get a new car she still chose a ford car again. I honestly dont this this car needs improving. This is definitly a affordable car to buy. I would also definetly recommend it.
4539,2 years ago,4,the 2010 ford escape was my first car ever in 2015. she ran well until 2018 when she kept turning off on me and even at one point didnt turn on at all. i kept taking the car to different places to get her fix even the ford place but nobody knew what was wrong until april 2019 when she gave out completely in the middle of the freeway. she had a good run
4540, 2 years ago,3,"Expensive compared to similar vehicles of other manufacturers. Great screen as a radio. Very roomy in front, and extra room in the back. Can hold 5. I would improve by a fancier interior to match the outside of the car. Overall would recommended for traveling"
4541, 2 years ago,4,"I love my ford focus 2012. I have the s model which I got at 75k miles for just around 5k . Great deal! Car drives very smooth and is cheap to find parts. I do have the manual transmission due to automatics having failure . Great first car maybe , and great if you just need a daily driver that's good on gas . Has alot of upgradable parts as well.  Ford Focus"
4542,2 years ago,4,It’s a ok car my daughter has one of these she loves it only thing I don’t like about it is it shits off when u stop the moment u hit the gas it starts back up
4543, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car it’s a cute little car, the only thing I don’t like about it is that it’s really small inside so it’s always crowded in the back."
4544,2 years ago,5,"I love this car so so much , i usually love big cars and this is absolutely one of my favourite . The car is so fancy and the interior is so chic and comfy . I love the colors this car came in . I recommend it to everyone looking for a cool car"
4545, 2 years ago,3,"Had this car for 6 years and had a lot of issues out of my control. It had amazing gas mileage, but was in the shop a lot. It had a total of 4 transmission replacements within those 6 years and it was a known issue."
4546, 2 years ago,3,I found the Focus rather clumsy to drive as I wasn’t used to it. It had a better specification than my Fiesta and the interior design was better.
4547, 2 years ago,4,Had my fiesta for 3 years now and it was second hand when I bought it. It has had a few issues with trackrod ends and springs but no major issues. It’s a nice compact drive and gets me from A to B
4548, 2 years ago,4,"I'm disabled now but before when I could drive I drove my friend's Ford Focus and loved it.  Easy to drive, plenty of room, and stylish too!!"
4549, 2 years ago,5,"I own one. Great gas mileage, it's held up great for the last 10 years or so! Zoomy little thing (2005) I get the feeling it's going to keep going and going and going..."
4550, 2 years ago,4,I have a 2009 and I really enjoy it. I got it second hand so can't attest to it's original condition but I've had it for a few years now and I'm content!!
4551, 2 years ago,4,"I love my ford edge, except I feel like they saw me coming and I got a lemon. I've been back there getting more things fixed than ever"
4552,2 years ago,4,I personally enjoy this type of cars love the seeting it's so comfortable . The space is so good you're not to crowded & seat warmers .
4553,2 years ago,5,Very good gas mileage nice and comfortable to ride in sporty and compact but roomy as well. Love the car.
4554, 2 years ago,4,"Ford has never been my first choice, I prefer a vehicle with fewer breakdown issues. This is just my personal opinion, to each their own"
4555, 2 years ago,5,There’s only two kinds of cars I get into a Ford or Dodge and then I got my jeep now there’s three kinds of vehicles I get into Ford Dodge Jeep￼
4556, 2 years ago,5,This is what I want if I ever get rid of my jeep but that ain’t happening in time soon my jeep is my baby
4557, 2 years ago,5,Comfortable ride Pretty decent car actually good gas mileage decent sound system good breaks￼
4558, 2 years ago,3,Overall a very nice roomy car. A great ride. I love all the extras in this model. The dash console color changing lights were a unique feature. I felt it could have had more power. A extra large trunk with plenty of space. Comfortably seats 5.
4559, 2 years ago,4,"I've been a passenger and they are very comfortable, perhaps too small sometimes but personally I would like to purchase one for myself"
4560, 2 years ago,4,"Es cómodo para una familia pequeña, pero para una familia grande puede ser un lugar muy apretado. Me gusta el diseño y desde que mi mi mamá lo adquirió no hemos tenido problemas."
4561, 2 years ago,4,It gets me where I need to go and it’s been dependable. Great in gas too. I recommend for college students
4562, 2 years ago,4,"seems like an ol car, co worker has one and she really likes it. it's nice but not for me, I'm kinds over fords after all the issues I've had with my focus"
4563, 2 years ago,1,I have had SO many issues with my car. I have had it fixed numerous times and am still having issues with me 2012 with less than 95k miles on it. I do not recommend this vehicle AT ALL
4564, 2 years ago,5,This was probably the best car I ever owned. i loved how the car was spacious on the inside but wasnt a huge vehicle. the bluetooth was amazing. I miss it so much!
4565, 2 years ago,5,Very nice and comfy ride. Its a tow truck so its a whole lot of sitting. But its comfortable enough for a man who works all day and allows him to get up the next day and do it all over again.
4566, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Escape! I have an older hybrid, but it's still running great. Awesome gas milage and a comfy ride. Can fit my large teenage son and his friends, or a load of groceries to feed all those teenagers! I have taken multiple 1,200+ mile roadtrips in this and actually enjoyed it. My next vehicle will just be a newer version of this same SUV."
4567, 2 years ago,4,"It is a good little car to get to point A to point B. This is a 2014 and they have a history of the stereos going out but they won't recall them. My backseat floors leak and we can't figure out where the water is coming from. Other then that it is a great car, I get 31 miles per gallon. "
4568, 2 years ago,5,This car is so good. I recommend this car I like its mechanism. The cabin is very sophisticated
4569,2 years ago,5,"Love the Ford Escape. Great fuel mileage. Excellent handling . Whether you need thos car for a family or just for comfort and style, this is the SUV for you!"
4570, 2 years ago,5,This was my first car and I loved it. Is a really good SUV and good space. The car is good for road trips and everyday use.
4571, 2 years ago,4,"I have been thoroughly surprised with my vehicle, which is the first ford I've ever owned or thought about buying."
4572, 2 years ago,5,I drive a 2012 Ford Fusion SE. I haven’t had very many problems with it and it’s great on gas!! The leather seats are perfect and the seat warmers are a great touch in the winter. I’ve been putting tons of miles on it since it was purchased and I don’t see myself getting rid of it anytime soon.
4573, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2015 ford focus titanium that i really love! This car is reliable, comfortable, and gets the job done! The only issues i’ve had were company recalls that were fixed promptly by the dealership!"
4574, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVE the Ford Fusion. It's fast, it's spacious. It is just a generally food car. I just wish Ford would make a car that's better on gas. If they did better on MPG Ford Fusion would be a great all around car."
4575, 2 years ago,4,"Good everyday car, not the best on gas. Good for someone who needs a little extra space and a bit of power. Okay on hills, but size and longevity I'd prefer a Honda CR-V."
4576, 2 years ago,5,Literally only would drive or purchase a Ford Edge or escape they drive so smooth and are very safe. I love the backup camera. The digital screen inside the car. The heated and cooling seats. There’s so much to this car 
4577, 2 years ago,4,I don't drive anymore due to my epilepsy but I remember this was a ver nice car. My Mom had one and she loved it. She never had problems with it.
4578,2 years ago,4,"Smooth ride, maneuvers well and safely, sleek 
look and great gas mileage. The Ford Escape is great for long road trips or short distances. Pretty  good stereo. Attractive and excellent crash rating"
4579, 2 years ago,5,"I had the 2011 fusion in the blue metallic, gorgeous! One of my favorite cars to date, I'd have another one if the roads weren't so badly paved I'd go through lots of rims. It's a little expensive for the average but the engine is what you pay for and it handles beautifully can keep up with some sports cars! It was beautiful inside as well as the outside. Black rims we're a plus checks all the boxes"
4580, 2 years ago,5,"Engines are the best in it's class and makes my commute from NJ to NYC a lot better. The escape has smooth, quick pick up, handles closer to a sports car than a truck. I test drove other SUVs and the engine revs so high when you hit the gas and that drives me crazy. I do think Ford could make the interior look nicer, seems a bit cheap. Oh and one more improvement...the sound system! Then it'd be perfect!"
4581,2 years ago,4,This was my first car. It’s. 2012 model and is great on gas. I wish it had more of the bells and whistles but it does a great job as a car.
4582, 2 years ago,4,"I loved my 2015 Ford Focus. It was such a fun, peppy little car to drive. The back seat is a little tight, but to be expected on a sedan this size. The finished inside also are just cheap looking. But overall it’s a solid car"
4583, 2 years ago,5,I drove a hybrid which took some getting used to but let me tell you I loved that thing!!! It got about 44 miles a gallon I drove it all the way from Texas to Washington state and back and only spent $300 max on gas!!! It was by far my favorite car I’ve ever had and the nicest car I’ve had ❤️
4584,2 years ago,5,"not a lot of words for this one : easy to drive, cool design, the interior looks modern and futuristic, has a lot of options. the only downside that I would improve is the space. affordable price range"
4585, 2 years ago,5,"Generally I not the highest fan of ford vehicles. However I wouldn't ever trade in my focus in a million years. The easiest car that I had with simple maintenance, little if no issues. I would buy again"
4586, 2 years ago,5,"A very reliable and safe car. Repairs, Tax, I insurance and parts are all relatively inexpensive. It is efficient to run and is sleek and comfortable. I love my Fiesta. It gets me where I need to go and I have never had any issues in the 3 years of owning the car. Never had any major issues and always passes it's MOT. I have it in a beautiful lime green colour which makes it stand out. Highly recommend purchasing a Ford Fiesta as it is a good investment."
4587, 2 years ago,3,"I love my fiesta, however I've had issues with it since the beginning. The year of my car is a 2015 and it had a transmission recall on it; which took a couple years to actually fix. Other repairs on it have been quite expensive for only being a 5 year old car. My fiancé says that's what you get for having a Ford. Just wish it had more miles on it before it started having all these issues (<40,000).

Some positives: it looks nice, spacious for such a small car, i.e good trunk space. Great gas mileage currently getting 36 mpg. Good at both city and highway driving."
4588, 2 years ago,4,This car is good and my family members have this it's perfect 👌 car and I really like it because this car have good quality and some perfect option
4589, 2 years ago,3,"I rock a 4-Door Jeep Wrangler Rubicon (JL). Once you go Jeep, you only go anywhere else because you are broke or scared!   The new Bronco look bad arse, and gives the Jeep tough look a run for its money. However, due to the history of the Bronco, I would be an apprehensive owner. Plus I would only consider a Bronco if they stopped making the 4 Door Wranglers, and Cherokees....and the old ones were all broken beyond repair. #JeepGirl4Life "
4590, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford fiesta is a lot of car for less money. It is very compact and narrow, but it does not skimp on the features. A surprising option is the changeable ambiance lighting! Blue, pink, green... you decide! Great car for commuters. Could be a good first car or college student car, but it will not hold much! Gotta borrow someone elses car to move into campus. Great on gas mileage, and a 10 gallon tank. "
4591,2 years ago,2,"I have a 2013, which apparently was a garbage year for cars. I've had nothing but problems since I got it. The navigation is faulty despite numerous updates, and the clutch constantly fails and needs to be replaced (we're talking once or twice every year). There's a reason Ford is called Found On the Road Dead... Don't get one of these. Ford Focus"
4592, 2 years ago,5,I love my Ford Focus Titanium Hatchback. I get great mileage and a super smooth ride. I love all the bells and whistles in the titanium model. I couldn’t ask for more. I definitely recommend a Ford.
4593, 2 years ago,5,very comfortable and sporty leather seat with seat warmers sun roof siruos radio and great sound system gas efficient
4594, 2 years ago,4,It’s very comfortable family car with some nice leather seats and some modern touches. The Ford Escape gets wonderful gas mileage and has lots of space and storage good for big grocery trips I like the Ford Escape
4595, 2 years ago,5,"I am not a car type of person. What I mean by that long as it drives, safe, gets me to point a-b I am happy. I love the having the back up camera it really helps at night this is the first car I own that had it."
4596, 2 years ago,5,You can never go wrong with Ford. Comfortable and roomy but not too big like an SUV. Good gas mileage and comfortable...
4597, 2 years ago,3,I was looking at buying this vehicle in 2018. The car drove smooth and had some get up and go and all the bells and whistles but if felt super small and compact. The pricing was decent for a new car but I was just looking for a 4 door vehicle with a little more room.
4598,2 years ago,5,I love my car!! I’ve had it for about a year now and it’s great on gas.. we take several road trips as well. Rarely have issues under the hood.
4599, 2 years ago,4,My boyfriend has this car and it is very hard to park because of how long the car is. Other than that I believe this car is very reliable and dependable. This car is also one of the most common cars I see on the street so I would be inclined to say that everyone agrees it is a very pretty car.
4600, 2 years ago,4,It’s super good fast and family friendly love it because it has four doors and doesn’t consume slot of petrol very economic
4601,2 years ago,4,"My 2003 Ford Focus, I love my car. I live in Northern Jersey and often have to drive into NYC, having a compact car in a city like New York is the best way to go. Finding parking is always an adventure, having the Focus makes that adventure a lot easier for me. Other than the size, the car has been good for me. I enjoy driving it. "
4602, 2 years ago,5,"The best car, litteraly. Had it for 3 years, kinda old, bur does the job perfectly. Good thing it does’t “eat” much."
4603, 2 years ago,2,"I mean...it's fine. It gets me from point A to point B, but it's a newer car (2018) and the suspension has already been replaced by warranty. There have been several recalls. I don't think Ford is as tough as it once was. "
4604, 2 years ago,3,I can't really give a good enough review it's comfy to ride in but u have never gotten to drive one. Myself I'm not a fan of cars I prefer SUVs just more room. It's a nice slick design inside as far as cars go but I don't think I would own one myself.
4605, 2 years ago,3,"I had an older 2001 model that died on me so I upgraded to a fusion. This car was not great for the Wisconsin winters but did get really good gas mileage. The backseat was way too small to fit adults comfortably, I'm sure kids would be fine but I don't have any kids so I can't say for sure"
4606, 2 years ago,5,I love this car. Mine is a 2009 so it's a little older but it's still great. It looks nice and it gets great gas mileage. I upgraded to this from a focus and the extra space in the fusion is really nice to have. Full grown adults fit in the backseat but I'm 6' tall and I wouldn't want to be stuck back there for a long trip but kids would be just fine
4607,2 years ago,3,"I’m really not a ford person! I prefer Chevys! I do enjoy my car and it is nice to have! My Air Conditioner is not the best, but I can get over that! I am grateful to have a car! I would recommend this car to a student or a 2 person family!"
4608, 2 years ago,5,Love my husbands mustang. He loves it more. I rarely get to drive it. But that okay. The ride is just as good.
4609, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my Ford Explorer, I'd highly recommend for bigger families. Mine seats my family of 6 comfortably, and the vents are set up perfect to keep all rows happy. I'd make it personally a little longer so I had more of a trunk, otherwise he is perfect!"
4610, 2 years ago,3,"I have two years left on my car loan and I can't wait for it to be done with. I hate this car. It rattles and shakes and feels like I'm driving a go cart. Mine is a 2014, of course one of the year models that has a transmission problem. There isn't a permanent solution either. You go get it fixed and you have to go back again. It gets me to work but I would not recommend."
4611, 2 years ago,5,Fusions are so nice! They are roomy and comfortable. The gas mileage is pretty decent. The ride is smooth and you feel safe. The price is really great for what you get. The color options are really nice too. It really is a great car and I would definitely recommend it
4612, 2 years ago,5,They are good on gas and it gets me from point a to point b. The car is very reliable.
4613, 2 years ago,4,I have a f250 King ranch truck it's a very nice to drive diesel truck it gets ok fuel mileage if you can afford to drive it you will like the room in this 4 door truck they are on the higher priced side for the quality of vehicle they have quite a few issues  Ford Motor Company
4614,2 years ago,5,Such a great car is not too big not is it too small! I loe the size and I love all the great features the vehicle has to offer. I'd defendant day it is a car to have no matter the situation great to have wether you want it for the family or just for yourself!!
4615, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Fusion.  It’s reliable, good on gas, and gets you where you need to go in one peace."
4616,2 years ago,4,The Explorer is a nice looking vehicle. It has evolved throughout the years and has finally improved on it's interior and exterior. It's a nice SUV but could use some more space in the third row seating.
4617, 2 years ago,1,Do not like my car at all! I believe I drive a 2013 & the car has a flaw... Something to do with the transmission causes the car to flutter when I drive & it is BEYOND unenjoyable. This car is also SO small!!!
4618, 2 years ago,4,"I have a 2008 Ford Taurus AWD, it goes surprisingly well in the snow/slush/mud. I also have a 4WD Jeep and I've gotten that stuck more than the Taurus. It heats and cools quickly, has decent speakers, and a decent amount of extra features. Overall, only complaint is that the body has seemed to rust fast but that's my complaint with any new age vehicle."
4619,2 years ago,3,"My mom owns this car, it’s OK. I’m not the biggest fan of Ford. It does have some awesome features but it’s not that roomy on the inside. My favorite part is the door sunroof and the entertainment system￼"
4620,2 years ago,5,"Gas milage is great and it runs smooth and mostly quiet! Its a bit small and is tough to fit a lot of friends in, but it’s functional, compact, good MPG! Affordable too. Great for going to and from work and/or school!"
4621, 2 years ago,5,Huge fan of this vehicle since it came out. The modeling of exterior has only gotten better and the Ford Sync system is great!
4622, 2 years ago,4,Perfect midsize SUV. Great for road trips with 2 or 3 other people. Gas mileage is a plus!
4623, 2 years ago,5,Ford Focus is my first car and although she’s a little old she’s such a trooper! So reliable and affordable
4624,2 years ago,2,Not the most reliable vehicle I’ve owned. Lots of maintenance  required and cause a wreck because the reverse was constantly troubling. The one day a car was coming at me at full speed all I had to do was back up to get away but my reverse was sticking and the car hit us full force causing the windows the shatter and air bags to split open my arms
4625, 2 years ago,5,"Great car as most Fords are its dependable and good on gas and is very comfortable, a great every day car."
4626,2 years ago,1,"Nothing but problems. I bought this car brand new in 2000. Recalls, ball joints, 100,000 miles transmission went out, and it went to the junk yard! HATE FORD"
4627, 2 years ago,5,"The Ford Fusion is an excellent vehicle! I have owned a Fusion for going on 7 years and highly recommend. It is great on gas, spacious trunk, as well as generous leg room for passengers in the back."
4628,2 years ago,4,Ford cars are cool in my opinion. I would do anything to drive a Ford everyday if I had the chance. I recommend Ford because I grew up with family that all they ever drive is a Ford car so obviously I like the brand too.
4629, 2 years ago,4,It’s taken us all the way to the beach. It’s been well loved and manhandled. We appreciate it.
4630, 2 years ago,5,"very comfortable and clean car, has lots of room to occupy any products you need to carry"
4631, 2 years ago,4,My min owns a Ford Escape and it’s a very big car super comfy cheap on the gas side and it’s very smoothly to drive. Amazing car
4632, 2 years ago,3,I have transmission issues allot. I have a 2012. 😳😳😳😳 other than that it’s okay. Not very roomy
4633, 2 years ago,5,It is the  best car I have driven. It is very economical and yet  affordable. It saves me gas and rides very well. It is very roomy and comfortable for  my whole family. I love that  there ae  sensors for backing up so I never hit anything or anyybody
4634, 2 years ago,4,My boyfriend owns an f150. I ride in it often. It's older but it gets is where we need to go without a problem
4635,2 years ago,4,I rent cars all the time and these are always available.   Safe reliable and up to date with technology
4636, 2 years ago,5,"I have had my Ford Focus Hatch back for 10years and it was already three years when I bought it.  It has just started to really cost money to fix so I will be buying a new car soon, but I will be heart broken to see it go.  It’s been great, it hasn’t needed a lot of maintenance and is amazing on gas.  I could fit a lot in it when the back seat is down. Love my car!"
4637,2 years ago,5,I love this car and hardly ever have any issues other than needing motor mounts. As long as you keep up with normal maintenance then everything the car is great!￼
4638, 2 years ago,5,I bought a 2019 Ford Escape. It is perfect. I love that there is a lot of space (especially trunk space). I love that it has AWD... which is a must for Minnesota winters. Smooth ride. Beautiful interior. My only wish was that I could have got the titanium package.
4639,2 years ago,5,"Love this car so much. Its so roomy and has all the essentials like being able to connect your phone, etc. Really smooth drive and feels very safe"
4640, 2 years ago,4,"Overall I’m extremely satisfied with the car. However, I have one issue which is the petrol gauge. This will quite often show I have a different amount of fuel than I actually do but with some research, have found this is a common fault with the 2013 models. This is the only problem I’ve had and it’s proven to be a great first car"
4641, 2 years ago,5,Looks like a luxury car at an affordable price. Drives well and is very reliable. Have had no issues with it.
4642, 2 years ago,4,"Love my car! Comfortable cheap insurance cheap tax and super easy on petrol, I love modified cars and when I bought it it was stock so I bought a modified kit online and modified my car, it was a adorable car perfect for first time drivers and I woukd récommend"
4643, 2 years ago,4,Loved my Fiesta!! Was easily the best car I've owned. Only got rid of it because it was too small for my family.
4644, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2009 Ford Focus SES and it is by far the best car I’ve had. Nice and compact, so it’s easy to park, but comfortable to travel in, and room for all of your things. Seats fold down in the back to make more room. Genuinely fun car to drive. Super reliable too!"
4645, 2 years ago,1,I am 5'10' i did not fit in the car very well. the seats were not comfortable at all. The transmission had issues from day one. and ford blamed for them. i would never own a ford again after the way they treated worse car i ever owned 
4646,2 years ago,3,Good. But it is very bumpy. My partner bought it a while back. Dont mind. It is very high. It looks very nice. Not that bad. Would improve it by being smoother on the bumps on the roads. It is also affordable. Other than it being bumpy would highly recommend.
4647, 2 years ago,5,Ford Focus is one of the best brands my family loves boards as they are good family car the great space economical to the environment they're spacious for children as a lot of room lots of storage and it's a great family car if you got children my family gets forwards because we think it's one of the best brand that can ever be in car.
4648, 2 years ago,5,Ford Fiesta Titanium one of my most common brands to buy from forward because I think they are a reliable they're easy to manage their cost-effective because they don't break as much as another car would it's economical if you get the economical car I think I would carry on by me from food because I think they are reliable if you have a problem they would sort it out straight away if they can't get the part you need for your car they will order it
4649, 2 years ago,5,Great car ! Is very easy to maintained and easy to drive . Is not an expensive care and the interior is beautiful and easy to clean :)
4650, 2 years ago,4,"My vehicle is partially old being a 2010 Ford Escape XLT. This car is only including a 4-Cylinder vehicle, which broadly is running partially fine (except only have 4-gears within the Trans & terrible changing automatic gears when driving. My minor car replacement has only included the overall exhaust pike being replaced while that's almost it. But this vehicle brand new within 2010 (including approximately $25,500 fully being loaded then except a moonroof), has repetitively (in all cars) for primarily having their only Right-Rear fender being rusted excluding anything else upon this Vehicle. Even the local Ford Dealership have confirmed that this area has always begins there compared with any other fender within while that's it."
4651, 2 years ago,4,They drive really smooth and very comfortable. I just like a bigger vehicle like the explorer. It's a nice crossover for the price and everything you have with it. 
4652, 2 years ago,4,I've owned a Focus for 2 years now and it's very little maintenance.  Gets me where I need to go and great on gas mileage.
4653, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. This is the first time I've ever owned a nice vehicle that I didn't have to worry if it would break down or suddenly stop working. I'm definitely a fan
4654, 2 years ago,5,"I love my 2017 Ford Escape Titanium.  It has all the bells and whistles I really wanted without the price tag of a ""luxury"" vehicle.   It runs smoothly,  has plenty of power,  and is great on gas."
4655,2 years ago,5,I have a 2017 Ford Focus and it’s by far the best car I’ve ever owned. I have no cons to say about this car.
4656, 2 years ago,5,"I love my ford explorer, best vehicle I've ever owned. Very luxurious and functional. We have the heated leather seats, the 3rd row and the back up camera which were all a must for me when searching for a new vehicle. The exterior is very sharp as well. The only downside is the blindspot but the mirrors are very essential in making up for that."
4657, 2 years ago,4,Loved the car! Had it as a rental after I was in an accident and it was a great drive. It was a little smaller than I am used to but overall would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new vehicle!
4658, 2 years ago,5,"I drove my fusion, from Charleston WV to El Palo, Texas and back. 1680 there and 1680 back, it was a very long drive, but it was very comfy and smooth. I had no problems out of my car. It's safe, I know this for a fact and reliable."
4659, 2 years ago,5,"My sister has this car.. it’s very quite. It’s a good thing compared to the others. It’s a hybrid, which makes it very gas efficient saves you a lot of money"
4660, 2 years ago,5,love my lil white Ford Fusion ! so easy to get into with no need of a key & saves gas like ! It couldn’t get any better !
4661, 2 years ago,4,I would give Ford focus a 4 because I don't like the cars that the company make. Some car or truck yes I like to buy. My mom has one ford focus car he love that car. For me I love the car but not to much for my opinion for the brand. I would like to see more stuff in that brand.
4662, 2 years ago,3,Horrible handling and everything just feels cheap and rough. I hated even test driving this thing
4663, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford focus.  It's very dependable, great on gas.  It's a great carfor the price.  I've owned several Ford focus cars and have never been let down by any of them.  It is very durable no major defects.  I couldn't be happier with any other car. "
4664, 2 years ago,5,I love my hybrid and it saves us so much money in gas! Brought it when it was only one year old and won't trade this car for a ehile
4665, 2 years ago,5,"The Ford Fusion is great! My husband has a fully loaded 2017 Ford Fusion and it is awesome. I love the hands free capabilities, the navigation, the safety monitors, and the heated seats. The gas mileage is pretty good considering he drives roughly 80 miles a day (round trip) to work everyday (Monday to Friday). "
4666, 2 years ago,5,"This is another great car. The model I am familiar with has all the bells and whistles you could want in a car. It's so comfortable and obviously reliable because it's a Ford. I know people who have had bad experiences with it, but not me! My first car was a Ford Taurus, so I am a little biased toward the brand."
4667, 2 years ago,5,"It's a good family car. The heated seats are comfortable. The back up camera add safety. The back lifts up to put groceries in before you even get to the car, nice for rainy or snowy days. It gets great gas mileage and drive well on snowy roads. The automatic four wheel drive sensor adds extra safety on bad roads."
4668, 2 years ago,4,For compact vehicle it serves it's purpose it's affordable drives OK with minimal issues custom lighting features need for under glow inside vehicle hopefully safety ratings are OK girlfriend owns the car it works to get her to and from point a to point B up for work.
4669, 2 years ago,5,Good vehicles gets you to any location. I used to travel alot in my truck such as drive to philly or new York which was an adventure. The steering wheel becomes loose and yes affordable but nowadays are little crazy prices and yes would recommend.
4670, 2 years ago,5,great car for a 1st car gift. i love my car so much and it doesn’t waste a lot of gas
4671, 2 years ago,5,I love my focus. The only issues I have is it isn't very old and its falling apart. I wish they put more effort into allowing the car to stay great.
4672, 2 years ago,5,"I got a great deal on a 2016 Ford Fusion to have as a second vehicle. It is not the fully loaded or sport model, but does have a nice amount of standard features. There is a fair amount of leg room, a huge trunk, nice sound system and it gets amazing gas mileage. I can easily get 35+ miles per gallon highway and it averages about 27+ miles per gallon city. I would recommend a Fusion for anyone looking for a peppy, fuel efficient and good looking vehicle!"
4673, 2 years ago,5,I gave it five stars even though I drive a Ford edge and that wasn't one of my options but that was the closest thing to what I drive absolutely loved it there is enough room for me and my husband and my kid and a couple of our friends and still have room in the back good gas mileage rides nice very roomy comfortable
4674, 2 years ago,2,"Definitely would not recommend. We have the 2008 model. Probably just bought it from the wrong place but we had the power steering go out the day after we bought it, and then the transmission as I was driving, and more often than not—even with multiple fixes from a mechanic, the brakes are super mushy and it’s terrifying when you’re not expecting it. Also the sunroof gets clogged so if it rains really hard our car gets poured on on the inside."
4675,2 years ago,3,My sister had this kind of car before so I like the design of the car. I thought it was nice on the inside. It also it rides smooth.
4676, 2 years ago,3,Decent car for the size but after time becomes harder to maintain. I loved the hatchback glass trunk for storing and accessing fishing rods. It was roomy inside and a great car for road trips but after a while things started to go downhill consistently.
4677,2 years ago,5,"I absolutely LOVE my vehicle. It has a turbo eco boost, back up camera and drives amazing in the snow. It is a mid sized SUV so not to big and not to small and the millage is reasonable. This SUV is fairly inexpensive for the overall quality. I will 100% recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an SUV."
4678, 2 years ago,4,Smooth ride and was roomy! I liked the look of it a lot! My only complaint was that the backseat wasn’t as roomy as I like!
4679, 2 years ago,5,I have had my Ford Edge for a year and a half now and I love it! I feel like all Fords are great cars and are very reliable! I feel very safe in my car and love all my features. I think Fords are reasonably priced.
4680,2 years ago,5,I love driving this car because it drives smoothly and can go fast. The car is good on gas and fits to 5 people at the max. The trunk is spacious and the technology is good as well. I would recommend if your looking to buy a small car with basic features.
4681,2 years ago,5,"Me encanta la línea de estos carros, estos Ford fiestas tienen un modelo muy renovado, son carros eléctricos que brindan todas las comodidades totalmente enamorada"
4682, 2 years ago,5,i love this company i would recomend them in a heart beat. they can have all my money if i had it like that. thank you
4683, 2 years ago,5,i love this company. they get their best products out on the line for any type of costumer and is very realible.
4684,2 years ago,5,"Great car. Speedy. Quiet. Good condition. The floor and the seats are more plasticy than I’d like but I mean, this isn’t my car, it’s my parents haha. It is wide and roomy, but the cup holders are too small for my taste."
4685, 2 years ago,4,We have a FORD F150 2017 and this baby is great!! It's so big that I can comfortably lay down in the backseats!!! It's such a good vehicle for roadtrips and camping! The only downside is that it guzzles gas! I feel super safe and secure out on the road :) 
4686, 2 years ago,4,The ford escape is my first car. It is easy to drive and I like the black color of my car. It has plenty of space for me and is a good looking car. 
4687, 2 years ago,3,From a mechanics perspective I would have to definitely say that the Ford Escape is not for everybody I mean there's good with the bad but mostly bad wouldn't recommend it to an individual just from my experience as a mechanic tell me what these vehicles definitely keeps the shops making money but I have also heard that the state or a hair could be very reliable so I could be wrong maybe take the good from the bad I'll leave this up to everyone to decide
4688, 2 years ago,3,The Ford Focus I would definitely have to say that is one of the greatest Vehicles out there ever made by Ford still to this day remains very efficient and economic and the very reliable vehicle I would have to definitely recommend this to any new car buyer out there that's looking for a Great efficient vehicle and nice and compact size that you fit anywhere highly recommended go get yourself a Ford Focus
4689, 2 years ago,3,This vehicle I would definitely have to say is one of the best vehicles out there on the market very efficient on gas and very economic for the environment I would definitely have to recommend this for anybody looking for any of these characteristics for a great vehicle I recommend it to anyone out there looking for one of the best vehicles made out there by Ford
4690, 2 years ago,3,love the color. just don’t feel like the price goes along with the car. would maybe buy
4691, 2 years ago,4,My brother owns a hatchback model of the Focus. It’s a more basic car but gets great gas mileage and has a sporty feel. It’s very affordable. I would have loved a car like this when I was in high school!
4692, 2 years ago,4,My brother owns a fusion. It rides nice and handles well in snow and rain. I’d buy one if I needed a smaller car.
4693, 2 years ago,4,"My boyfriend bought a newer focus recently and there's a lot I like about it. It sits lower than my current car, but not too much! I drove it from Brookings, SD to Fargo, ND and it handles well on the road. It is relatively quiet and easy to drive. I would consider a focus for my next car."
4694, 2 years ago,5,Love our diesel fiesta it’s fantastic to drive great on fuel consumption with mpg smooth to drive sharp breaks love it
4695, 2 years ago,5,I love my fiesta it’s my all time favourite runaround car. I get great miles to the gallon. Never had an issue will have to take it into the garage. Just a really great car comes in a great colour to￼o.
4696,2 years ago,5,"Love it! Great to drive, economical and fun. Looks great and I've had no problems with it. Cheap to tax and insure"
4697,2 years ago,5,I currently drive a 2016 Ford Escape. I would recommend this car as it's affordable and safe. Six weeks after purchasing my car I was stopped in traffic and hit by a truck and essentially walked away from the accident. My brand new car was totaled but I immediately bought a new one; this car saved my life.
4698, 2 years ago,3,It was an okay it lacks a lot of power and pro it’s great on gas and fuel but cons has many issues I would put a 2.0 instead of a1.0 but the St are the best car out there but they are price actually really good
4699, 2 years ago,2,I bought my pita brand new. It goes 0 to 60 in about a whole weekend.  I’m thankful that I have a bumper-to-bumper warranty because this car spends more time at the Ford dealership them in my driveway￼
4700, 2 years ago,3,I used to have a Ford Escape not real happy with the new ones.  It doesnt seem to have the room the older ones have.
4701, 2 years ago,3,"Very basic, great for city driving, I don’t like the outside of the car as much as other brands, I would change the look."
4702,2 years ago,5,I have owned 3 different models of Ford vehicles and have always been very pleased.  Service is easy and if parts are needed they are extremely easy to locate.  My current Ford has high mileage and still runs great.  I’d definitely recommend Ford to friends and family.
4703, 2 years ago,5,Influenster doesnt letme pull up my truck either. This is dumb. Reviewing items we cant find is dumb! Fix this please. Very annoying
4704, 2 years ago,5,I have a 2008 Ford Escape and she is my WORLD! Has been absolutely perfect for me. I have leather seats and tinted windows.
4705, 2 years ago,5,This car has never let me down. Bought it used and I’ve had it for 7 years! It’s been a good car
4706, 2 years ago,4,"little bitty go cart of a car, but fun! I wish for a bit more room, but if economy and size are important to you, this might be the car for you"
4707, 2 years ago,5,Recently bought a used 2013 f150 and it's my first truck. From now on I will never not own a truck!! We love this for our family of four. There is even enough room to bring the grandparents along. The price was right for the quality of truck.
4708, 2 years ago,5,The best car I have ever purchased has all I every needed. I have always owned Ford but never a Ford focus and it is really nice.
4709, 2 years ago,3,"When my SUV was in the shop i was given a Ford Focus for the day. It was in the middle of winter when I was given the car and it took forever to heat up and defrost the windshield. I also noticed the car drove weird, it may have been the steering of that one but i've heard the same from others. Good cheap car for young drivers, i wouldn't say they are the most reliable though. "
4710, 2 years ago,4,"I love my ford escape! It's great on gas, and the eco boost is worth the extra $$! They are a smaller SUV so if you have numerous kids in sports such as hockey where there are big bags you might want to consider going with a bigger SUV! I haven't had many problems with mine other than yearly wear/tear, and oil changes. Great beginner SUV! "
4711, 2 years ago,4,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed driving this car! I rented it to go to a friend's wedding and am typically a snob about American cars, mostly because I think the features aren't designed to be as aesthetically pleasing and the features feel cheapened. But this car! It had great pickup and a very enjoyable driving experience. It had a lot of features, all of which were easy to use even for somebody getting into the car for the first time. I wouldn't have known it's a hybrid - it doesn't have that sort of golf-cart feel like a Prius or the delay in pickup like others I've driven. The air conditioning is a dream - it'll freeze you out, which is great given that I was not feeling so hot on the way back from said wedding. "
4712,2 years ago,5,"La focus è una macchina molto bella, solida e robusta, ha una guida fluida sopratutto nelle curve. E' spaziosa, capiente e ha tantissimi contenitori in ogni parte dell'abitacolo per nascondere smartphone e chiavi ad esempio. Io ho la station wagon titanium, è davvero bellissima e poi consuma poco."
4713, 2 years ago,5,"this is my first car and i absolutely love it. great is gas and i have have no problems with is so far. nothing to improve, a great first car and i see myself sticking with this one for awhile. i would 100% recommend"
4714, 2 years ago,5,I have a ford Expedition. I am a mother of 3 kids and I babysit 3 other kids. So I have at least 6 kids with me 90% of the time. With the third row seating it makes it super easy. I have not had any issues with this car since I have had it. This is the very first ford I have ever owned and it has outlasted any other car I have ever had. I would highly recommend this to anyone. And everyone!!!! Its roomy so when I have only my kids we can lay the back seat down and load up the kids bikes if we need to or in the summer when we go camping we dont have to worry about not having enough room for everything. It is all around an amazing vehicle.
4715, 2 years ago,5,I've been in my friend's mustang as a passenger multiple times and it's always been a great experience. I loved the lighting details in the interior as well as the exterior with the mustang logo lighting up on the floor.
4716, 2 years ago,5,I give a Ford Fusion five stars. It’s great on the gas and has nice interior. A Ford Fusion is a safe and great for the family. It can be a little crowd at Times if you have five people in there but it’s enough space for four or less!
4717, 2 years ago,5,This car is one of the most comfortable cars Ive driven. The best thing is how economic it is and its perfect for driving around town. The price is pretty good. I would love to own that car. If you want to save lots of money on fuel you should get it!
4718,2 years ago,5,I have a grey 2016 Ford Escape and I love it. It’s roomy for me and my three children. I love that it has a rear camera. The features on the SUV are amazing. Touch screen nice size radio. Drives smoothly. Have had it for over a year and no problems whatsoever.
4719, 2 years ago,3,It's a nice car drive it for three months  while I was looking for a new car. But Honda's are just my favorite car
4720, 2 years ago,5,Currently own a 2012 that gets great fuel mileage and is a smooth ride. Plenty of seating for 4-5 adults and still room for luggage in the back. Overall an affordable vehicle compared to other options in that price range.
4721, 2 years ago,5,I love my car! It gets great gas mileage and has never lead me wrong! And the Ford dealership always takes care of me and my car when I need a tune up or oil change!
4722, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford Escape has a great spacious interior, great power trains, and intuitive infotainment. But it has sloppy handling and cheap interior material."
4723,2 years ago,5,"Love my escape! Have had two and they have never let be down. Great on gas mileage, lots of room for your family. Great car to travel with when you don't want to have to take multiple vehicles. My first one got up to 200,000 + miles and still ran like it was brand new. Only reason I got a new one is because I hit a deer 😂"
4724,2 years ago,5,Great quality never had any serious issues. Came with Sirius radio. Has heated seats. Especially love the heated seats and the way it connects to my phone.
4725, 2 years ago,3,"Beautiful suv, but lacking in the space I want. The price is a bit high for the space, but man is she a beauty!"
4726, 2 years ago,3,"The Ford Fusion is a nice car, but it's not my favorite. The biggest reason I'm not a fan of the for fusion is because the hood of the car is too high up and the front row seating is too low, so it is difficult to see over the hood lower to the ground. It rides nice but I would not buy this car."
4727, 2 years ago,3,My car is super small . It’s a 2016 but it looks way older . That’s the only thing i don’t love . Besides that it’s super small. Cool first car can’t wait to trade it in for a midsize car. Besides the size and the interior it’s a decent car.
4728, 2 years ago,4,"I have a daughter in college driving a Ford Fusion. Although it has has a couple of little recalls, it has been a great car.  She picked it out herself when she was 18 and it still looks good!"
4729, 2 years ago,5,I recently purchased a 2017 Ford Escape. I absolutely love it. It is definitely a step up from my old 2008 Escape. It has heated seats and a back up camera. It even has a built in GPS. I can’t wait to drive it around this summer!!!
4730, 2 years ago,4,"I really like the  Ford Fusion . I think it's a nice looking car.  It's a nice ride, coming from a passenger.  Seems to be good on gas and its cute."
4731, 2 years ago,5,"The  Ford Escape is definitely a great car. We got this years ago now, and this car still runs like a dream.  We got it in 2013 I think and it seriously like never has a problem.  Good on gas, drives smoothly,  and has some great features."
4732,2 years ago,4,My mom owns this and I've droven it a few times it's not so badd a little too small for me I like trucks but it's a really nice car and it's great for families
4733,2 years ago,5,I have a Ford Ranger 2019 I absolutely love it I highly recommend this truck it's not too big and it's not too small it runs great
4734,2 years ago,2,Not the biggest fan of this car nothing against it but i would never buy this again it wasn't for me didn't like the look on the inside
4735,2 years ago,4,Its a nice car i would recommend getting one of these i think its a safe car my mom had one and she absolutely loved hers
4736,2 years ago,1,I absolutely hate this car. I bought a 2006 Ford focus brand new and within a couple years it started to have problems.
4737, 2 years ago,4,"I would really recommend the Ford Fusion if you got it brand new  or with low miles . It's been a good car for us. A lot of people dislike Ford's but it has been reliable and it is now at 280,000 miles I'm still running strong. It's had certain things wear down over time like the ambient lighting and the digital display on the radio but all in all I say it's been a good car, we've had it for almost 10 years."
4738, 2 years ago,5,My brother and I both have this car because of its reliability! It does very well with gas mileage! I only fill up once every other week. The one I purchased was previously owned and I got a good deal so I can’t talk on new prices.
4739, 2 years ago,5,The only brand I’ll ever purchase! Owned a Ford for many years! I like Ford over the other competitors.
4740, 2 years ago,5,Ford Fusion is one of my favorite family cars. It is a great blend of fun and function. And it is affordable.
4741, 2 years ago,4,Ford Focus is a great small vehicle. It is surprising spacious and great for urban living where space is at a premium.
4742, 2 years ago,5,"For Ford, one of the best models so far that I have ever owned is a GT 5.0 Mustang. Really fun and loud project car. Got many eyes looking while on the road. Havent came across any problems soo far. Pretty much one of the best toys I have ever gotten."
4743, 2 years ago,4,"Great family car for the 3 of us, enough room for comfort but still small enough to park in mybusy street at home!"
4744, 2 years ago,5,"Ford Fusion is very good brand, I definitely recommend it good interior just good working car for the city, though improve it, maybe make it a little bigger, but overall, I love it, it's a little expensive, but also affordable at the same time"
4745, 2 years ago,2,"Nice car, nice interior, just not my style, but if it is your style, I say go for it. It's a good car, just like I said, not my style, how to improve it, maybe if it was a truck, it is very expensive, but affordable, I do recommend it, and I did love mine at the time."
4746,2 years ago,3,"I had a ford focus 2004 and I loved this car but starts to fail a lot, It wasn't an agency car, I bought it second hand maybe for that. The car its okay, I felt comfortable in it. I spent just a little gasoline its a big plus. I recommend it."
4747, 2 years ago,4,"Love my escape! Nimble bit solid! I would appreciate a bit more space in the back but otherwise, a great safe ride"
4748, 2 years ago,5,"Out of all the cars I've owned,This is my absolute favorite. It's my first S.U.V (which I swore I would never buy) I feel very safe and secure when I'm driving! It's not too big and it's not too small. It's a beautiful S.U.V. I would highly recommend!!!"
4749, 2 years ago,4,"I owned a 2007 Focus. This was my first car, and I loved it. Great gas mileage which helps when you drive 40 miles to work. It had a great safety rating even being a small vehicle. The car was very affordable when it came to maintenance. I would only change the fact that you could only find 4 ply tires on."
4750, 2 years ago,1,"I had a 2010 Fusion. I would say it was nothing but crap. There was no gas cap, but a fuel inlet. This allowed dirt into the fuel system. The transmission could not handle mountainous areas on the interstate. The transmission would shift hard, and overheat. When I got rid of the car I was $9000 upside down, but I had to get a safe vehicle for my family."
4751, 2 years ago,4,We own a 2013 Fusion which has been reliable and efficient. The only con that comes to mind is the screen will randomly cut off or the Bluetooth audio will skip songs that are playing.
4752, 2 years ago,4,"We bought this car without a lot of research because we were in a bind. It’s been reliable but it hasn’t held up well in unusual ways. For example, the driver door keeps coming unaligned and part of the control panel on it is lifting up. It’s one of the strangest issues I’ve seen with a car."
4753, 2 years ago,5,"Un carro excelente, interior moderno. Motor y transmisión excelente. Excelente carro para viajes, rinde mucho la gasolina. Cómodo. Fue mi segundo carro Ford y ha sido él favorito. Lo recomiendo ampliamente"
4754,2 years ago,5,Nice company I own a 2004 Ford expedition smooth drive perfect for my little family has alot of space to grocery shopping also my babys strollers or tent when we got camping just love it
4755, 2 years ago,5,I like the ford focus. Nice and roomy. Drive and handle nice. I would remean this card tpo anyone. Easy on gas. There nothing i would change on this car. Affordable car.
4756, 2 years ago,5,I have a Ford Fusion SE (2019). I love it. I’m a car person so it works well for me. Drives smoothly and is pretty good on gas. I like the keyless start option and backup camera.
4757, 2 years ago,4,This is an ok ride. Not perfect but gets the job done. I would drive it but I know people that love them.
4758, 2 years ago,4,I my Ford Escape.  We just bought a few weeks ago. So I am still all the bells and whistles it has. It gets great gas mileage.  My favorite  thing is the heated seats.
4759, 2 years ago,3,"It does the job. I have a 2007 Ford Escape so it definitely is not new... It has held up super well and is fairly reliable. I am just hoping it gets me through this last stretch of college. I received the car as a gift, so who could complain. I have just recently passed 100,000 miles so I am afraid that a lot of problems may start to arise soon..."
4760, 2 years ago,5,"The Ford Fusion is a four-door, five-passenger mid-size sedan manufactured and marketed by the Ford Motor Company. Introduced for the 2006 model year, two generations of the Fusio  have been produced in gasoline, gas/electric hybrid, and gas/plug-in electric hybrid variants. It's a great car"
4761,2 years ago,4,I drove a Ford f150 it was a great vehicle. Drove smooth . One of the things I didn't care for is how much gas the vehicle took to run. Another con is the radio. I guess I would reccomend putting better sound systems in the trucks. Overall still a great truck.
4762, 2 years ago,4,I owned a Ford Taurus and overall considered it to be a nice care. It did have to put a new transmission in the  vehicle. The car is not longer made. I cannot say how I would improve because they no longer my the car. At the time I believe it was affordable. 
4763, 2 years ago,5,"My sister and son-in-law owned ford fusions, It is great! The fusion is sporty and great on gas! They are very happy with their fusions."
4764, 2 years ago,5,we are a loyal ford family!. I love my Ford Focus! It drives great! great on gas mileage! just right for our family. We are looking at purchasing a explorer suv.
4765, 2 years ago,4,"Great gas mileage and runs fairly quiet. I’d consider it to be a fairly affordable car. That said there is a part that keeps breaking. It’s not expensive, but it does impact wether or not the heating/cooling works. When it breaks it makes an obnoxious clicking noise if the climate control is on. I had it replaced once during warranty and now it’s broken again."
4766,2 years ago,5,Good car like the all wheel drive features it has roomy enough Room for luggage in transporting passengers
4767, 2 years ago,5,I do like the size and the rooming us of the Ford. It can debt definitely be used as a very safe family car it has four wheel drive. I live in Utah so that's definitely necessary. And has enough room to put a lot of car seats in which I need. Because I have 20 year old twin 2 year old boys plus a three year old and at a 12 year old so other than to take two vehicles we had to change up to a bigger car. That would allow us to all ride together. Rather than taking two vehicles wherever we went.
4768, 2 years ago,5,Pretty good car I would say and the colors are beautiful in this car works really good and it’s really just a car that is good
4769, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2009 Ford Focus SE (Black, Manual). Picked this car up after my 2018 Fiesta was totaled, and have loved it ever since. Gear shifting could be smoother, but is a fun ride nonetheless. A little noisy, but don’t notice as much with the radio on, and may just be my car."
4770, 2 years ago,3,I’m not a huge fan of fords. My husband car had had a bunch of transmission issues. But it is a pretty cheap car if you’re tight on a budget. The seats are nice and it offers Bluetooth connection.
4771, 2 years ago,3,Decent. Dont know to extensively how this car runs after normal use because i only used the vehicle as a rental. But had no issues. Drove well.
4772, 2 years ago,1,"Great on gas, and runs decent but i started having major electrical issues within the car almost immediately after i bought it."
4773, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. It is the perfect size bot too big or small! It rides really nice and has great upgrades. My favorite part is the panoramic sun roof I use it year round. It comes in great colors with ruby red being my favorite. The gas mileage is great and it is an awesome road trip vehicle
4774,2 years ago,3,We are Ford lovers. I've had multiple Ford cars and trucks. The first Focus I bought was an 2001 I purchased in 2005. We had 3 small kids and it fit us all comfortably. We got great gas mileage and it was nice to drive. I would recommend this vehicle for anyone
4775, 2 years ago,4,It’s nice. My mom has one and so do a lot of people in my family. I like that it’s not too high up for her to get into.
4776, 2 years ago,2,The paint quality of my dad's old focus was cheap and peeled withing a few years of production. The body was cheap and the engine died more times than i can count. The old saying of ford is good fords the best drive a mile walk the rest was very apparent in this car.
4777, 2 years ago,2,Good for a cheap car. Small inside. And feels cheaply made at the bad model. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they are desperate
4778, 2 years ago,5,"I love my ford escape. It is a paid for 2004 escape with 136000 miles. It still runs great. I have done basic maintenance that is necessary but as far as repairs go, I have had to replace 2 things, one being a compressor pulley and replaced complete front brake setup (not just brake pads).  Otherwise I've had great luck with my vehicle. Surprisingly the power windows, seats, locks and mirrors all still function without motor failure. The radio is still working and here is the real kicker, my dashboard, console and other covered parts that are exposed to the sun are still intact. They have no tears or cracks. All the interior fabric is still intact too. The vehicle is so roomy and we moved our apartment to our new house in my escape, minus three pieces of furniture. We've taken many trips in it and it rides great and is comfy to drive also. I cants say enough nice things about it. My husband recently got a new car cause I wasn't ready to trade my escape in yet. Besides being dependable and smooth ride, it also has so many memories attached to it. I'll be sad when it's time to move on but here is a little secret...I'm going to just buy a newer escape"
4779, 2 years ago,3,"I have a 2017 focus. Brand new. But,it came defective. Unfortunately, these cars are one of the most affordable but if you don't have warranty it'll cost you. I've had to take it in twice because it shakes. It's really annoying. Other than that, great car. Decent speakers, I love that it came with a back camera."
4780, 2 years ago,4,"These are fun little cars! I don't particularly care for ford vehicles personally but I had the opportunity to learn how to drive in one of these. These are honestly the best little cars for learning, super easy to maneuver around and learn to parallel park!"
4781, 2 years ago,3,Es un excelente carro muy cómodo y ahorrador de gasolina. Tiene un interior muy bonito. Pero la transmisión del 2012 al 2014 salió defectuoso y el mío está entre esos años. Así que se siente una vibración al acelerar
4782, 2 years ago,5,"I know that old joke about Ford meaning ""fix or repair daily"" (*amongst other similar jokes). Plus,  most of the people who I know who have owned Fords have been less than thrilled with their repair bills and breakdowns.  So, with this in mind, I was very nervous about buying my used 2009 Ford Focus SES model in 2010, which as a former rental car already had 34K miles on it.  But, it was my only option for a car at the time.  Fast forward to March 2020, and I am happy to report that this car has held up wonderfully with basic maintenance. Long may it continue to live in such a way, as I have 149K miles on it now and it is my daily commuter."
4783, 2 years ago,4,This is my sons car. A bit too small for a family. Great had mileage and decent cargo space. I like the hatchback.
4784, 2 years ago,5,"I actually drive a Ford Explorer, yet it was not a choice to review.  I love my Explorer!  I chose the Explorer over the Escape because it was a little bigger and I needed the size and power to pull a trailer with ease.  I’m completely happy with my Explorer and would recommend it to all."
4785, 2 years ago,5,Good on gas and comfortable for driver and passengers. Wasnt my car so I'm not sure how else to label it.   :)
4786, 2 years ago,5,"I definitely love this car, it's a ford which I'm not use to but it's very quite ans great on has and some what cheap to.fix the car if it breaks down. "
4787, 2 years ago,5,"I love our 2015 for focus see. It's very fuel efficient, reliable. We got this slightly used , however you would never know. It was in mint condition and low miles. Runs beautiful and has been the best car I've ever had"
4788, 2 years ago,4,Rented this car for a family trip from Miami to Gatlingburg and it held up really well. It was not an all-wheel drive vehicle but it handled well in the mountains and the trails. It was comfortable and a gently ride. Def recommend!
4789, 2 years ago,3,"Personally I’m not a huge fan of Fords sedans but they do better with SUVs and trucks. If you’re looking to buy from Ford, still to those and not cars / sedans."
4790, 2 years ago,5,"It was a rental - it's a nice, little SUV. Good on gas. It's not super spacious but there is enough room for 4 people and luggage. The radio/entertainment console was awesome. Not sure which version of the car I drove."
4791, 2 years ago,3,We had our escape for a little over a year. It was certified preowned. It was a good car for most of our ownership of it. It was in for repairs a lot. And the dealership couldn't fix a problem we had when turning the steering wheel. The last straw was when we took it in for an oil change. They were able to pinpoint a front axle leak but couldn't fix our precious problem. It's a good car if you can keep it out of the shop.
4792, 2 years ago,4,"My car is old, a 2002 but it's still running so I can't complain to much. I've had some repairs to do on it but nothing to expensive."
4793, 2 years ago,5,Very versatile easy to drive lasted us a long time ! I now Own a all wheel drive now which I’d prefer over front wheel drive but a great car !
4794,2 years ago,4,This is a great basic car for everyone. Nothing too special about it but it has a nice design to it and the interior is nice as well! A very good standard option for a smaller car.
4795, 2 years ago,4,I love this company.  They always put out good trucks and cars and I really love the look of the symbol.  All cars have good gas mileage and a very well price range.  All I drive is ford.  I recommend the f-150 or explorer.
4796, 2 years ago,5,"I love my 2011 Ford Edge. It's the first and only car I've ever had and it drives really easy as well as makes great road trips. It's a medium size car but perfect to comfortably fit five people. I've made so many road trips with it, including one cross country trip and she still hold up like a charm! "
4797, 2 years ago,1,It had no get up and go. I thought I was going to die merging onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Small car that feels like your sitting in a hole. Smooth drive but would never buy or recommend. It's way to expensive for what feels like driving the car from The Flintstones.
4798, 2 years ago,5,i dont know much about this particular but if im correct this is what my friend dakota drives ? idk but it drives pretty nice i guess . 
4799, 2 years ago,5,"My favorite of Ford vehicles. I'm not a Ford fan at all, but this car is very spacious and has great features! They even make some that look sporty and they are so nice too!"
4800, 2 years ago,5,This is a nice driving and riding car it could use more cushion in the seats as it can be rough riding for long periods of time. It has lots of room and has lots of torque when taking off! It is good on gas and has a nice display on the dash.
4801, 2 years ago,5,"A very good car, it is comfy and good, it is not that much expensice for the good car it is, i recommend it. It is easy to drive, its soft"
4802, 2 years ago,5,"Nice safe first car, I enjoy it riding in it. It has nice features also. Try to take advantage of the new graduate discount."
4803, 2 years ago,4,"My mom owns one and im not very up to date with it. It is a push start so there is alot that i dont understand. I dont think they last very long, but they might be because of how much it is used. I would not purchase this for myself."
4804,2 years ago,3,Good trunk space really good gas mileage nice new technology in the car and smooth drive
4805, 2 years ago,5,It has a great look and a great get up and go. People are always complaining the car. It is a great summertime car but challenging g to drive in the wintertime but that doesnt stop me!
4806, 2 years ago,1,Ford Focus? More like Ford Fukus. I would give it negative 5 stars if I could. I knew a chick that bought 2 brand new off the lot and they both had the same exact motor problem and were totalled because of the complications within a year. She had to go into debt and ended up with used vehicles that constantly break down. Buying those cars literally ruined her life.
4807, 2 years ago,1,I've never driven this kinda of car before. However it wouldnt let me choose the kind I have driven. And wouldnt let me skip the questions. So I can not rate this vehicle
4808,2 years ago,5,"This is a cute little car and the price is very affordable. They’re very comfortable to ride in, and the mileage is decent for a midsize SUV."
4809,2 years ago,5,I love this car because it’s much more reliable than the Fiesta. They use different parts for this vehicle over the fiesta which makes it more reliable. It has a perfect amount of space in the trunk is great for keeping a stroller. The price is very good as well as the mileage￼
4810,2 years ago,5,This car feels fast and is very spacious especially for the price. It looks really nice on the inside and has a lot of technological advances. The mileage is decent.
4811,2 years ago,1,"I had 46 warranty claims when I owned this vehicle. The mileage is not great, although the inside is pretty cute. It’s very affordable from the start, but the amount of work that goes into it makes it very unaffordable. I find this car to be very unreliable. My 46 warranty claims came within the first year of ownership. From my clutch blowing to my transmission being replaced and my TCM going out on Thanksgiving… I find this vehicle to be anything but reliable.￼"
4812, 2 years ago,3,I love my Ford Focus. It’s a nice size and i wish i had gotten a different color. It alsohas a recall / lawsuit on the transmission and i have to go every few months to get my clutch replaced.
4813,2 years ago,5,"It's a nice car. My 1st Ford. So far so good. Has serious xm radio, blue detailing , and tinted windows !! Its a nice cute car , dark grey. Also has sport mode."
4814, 2 years ago,4,We have a 2009 Focus got for cheap and it has almost 250k miles on it and runs like a champ. The rockers are all rotted out but the car still runs and drives nice! Gets us to and from places without any issues!
4815, 2 years ago,1,"This is the worst car I’ve ever.... anything!!!!! What’s not broken on this car and I have less than 60,000 miles on it in 7 years!!!! There is always a recall on this car yet Ford doesn’t do anything about it."
4816, 2 years ago,5,"Great vehicle, very modern and comfortable. its parts are a bit harder to find but you usually can find them online"
4817, 2 years ago,5,"Love it! Especially the gas mileage, don’t have to stop or fill up as often. All the bells and whistles are nice too."
4818,2 years ago,4,Good space to sit in. Nice seats. Gorgeous color in the outside.This my dream car to purchase.
4819, 2 years ago,3,"It was given to me by my parents. I enjoy driving it. And it still looks good for it to be a 14 year old car. I don’t have any complaints and it rides/drives smoothly. I don’t know how long Fords usually last, but this one is lasting a while."
4820, 2 years ago,2,"I rented the hybrid version of this car. It's one of those smooth, barely tell it's running type of rides.  I was able to easily pair my phone with the Bluetooth. It's very roomy inside and had all the bells and whistles. My only qualm was that at one point, i could get the car tho go in reverse so that i could back out of my parking spot. It kept going forward instead of backing up. Scary, annoying, and inconvenient!"
4821, 2 years ago,5,Amazing car. Loved every second driving it. So worth the money. I had one for a short time so nothing to really say as a con to it. One of my favs!
4822, 2 years ago,3,I've only driven this car about 3 times ever as it's my friends vehicle. It's a little bigger than I'm used to so that made driving it a little intimidating. The car itself drives really well and super comfortable to be in.
4823, 2 years ago,3,I personally don’t like Ford made vehicles. I’m a Chevy girl. My friend used to have a focus and it wasn’t bad. It had good gas mileage and was a pretty smooth ride.
4824, 2 years ago,4,"I love my Ford Focus, I've had this vehicle for almost five years and aside from the occasional part recalls it's perfect. I honestly am so satisfied with my purchase of this car that I most likely wont switch car brands ever."
4825, 2 years ago,5,"We have a 1999 Ford F-250 diesel truck that is a workhorse. It's not fancy, but it does an amazing job running and hauling anything you need it to do. Would highly recommend a quality Ford truck for anyone looking."
4826, 2 years ago,5,Got this car when we found out we were expecting. My husband worked for a Ford assembly plant and was able to get a discount which is why we picked Ford. This car was in our price range and was perfect for our little family. It is now becoming a tighter fit so i would live to upgrade to a bigger car. This was a great start.
4827, 2 years ago,5,Lets start off by saying this is a very smoth car and i didnt have any problems with it while i had it. What i love the most is that the car is spacious. The price was Grat also!
4828, 2 years ago,1,The Ford Fusion car is crap I hate it it seems that all the ford cars  my family have ever owned oh crap
4829, 2 years ago,1,The Ford Focus is a very bad car it stalls all the time for my mum I don’t drive it’s the worst car
4830, 2 years ago,3,I do love my car because I paid it off and it’s mine. However it’s not the car I would choose if I were buying a new car probably. I don’t like how it says there is an Aux hookup but there really isn’t. I do love the size of the car and how my short body fits comfortably in it!
4831, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford Fiesta is a small car that you’ll love driving. It’s cheap to buy and run, stylish to look at and available with lots of high-tech kit, although alternatives are roomier"
4832, 2 years ago,5,"I like this car, because the size is perfect for city drivers, of course for a big family it wouldn’t be so comfortable."
4833, 2 years ago,4,I have a 1985 F 150 Ford truck . It's a all white truck. I love it I honestly domt have cons because she always been my dream truck. So I dont really any improvement to do on it  . It's not expensive just some parts are. Yes I would recommend.
4834, 2 years ago,4,I like economy cars and Ford Focuses are usually small and compact and are made to save you money when it comes to gas and traveling.
4835, 2 years ago,5,This is my friend’s car she paid a great price on it plus she didn’t a lot gas while driving around for couple days too.
4836, 2 years ago,5,I have a 08 hybird and love it great gas mileage love the smooth ride how well it drives and how quite it is! I’m so glad I got one
4837, 2 years ago,3,Tiny car with a ton of punch. I had one for about 6 years. Loved it. Only negative is it has known transmission issues and it Is tiny. But it worked well for me!
4838, 2 years ago,5,"I enjoy riding in this sedan, a it is very quick and fun to ride in.  It is very up to date with modern technology."
4839, 2 years ago,5,Very reliable car! Very roomy and is great on gas!! Also rides very smooth and is comfortable.
4840, 2 years ago,4,I have never owned one but my Aunt leases Escapes all the time and they drive amazing. You’re sitting higher up than in a fusion or focus and they ride amazing! I would definitely recommend.
4841, 2 years ago,5,"My car I currently own is a hatchback Ford Focus and I absolutely love it. I love small cars, as I have to parallel park everyday, so it makes it easy. Filling the car with gas is super affordable as well!"
4842, 2 years ago,4,In high school when I first got my license I would drive my siblings and I to school in my Dad’s Ford Fusion. It definitely was a great car and I’m glad I had the chance to drive one. Would recommend!
4843, 2 years ago,5,It’s good love riding in it alone very smooth and will get a newer model sometimes soon
4844, 2 years ago,4,"I owned a ford focus for about five years. I liked my car the Bluetooth options are a huge help. The car is equipped with technology that can give you a diagnostic report via email.Ford was a good company to buy from, they treated me well. I drove the car to nearly 300,000 miles before I had to sell it to a friend and it is still running after some repairs. "
4845,2 years ago,5,"I drive a Ford Escape, my mother drives a Ford Escape and my aunts drive Ford Escapes. This goes to show how much we love Ford vehicles and especially Ford Escapes. My Escape is the 2017 model and it is the perfect size. My car is black with silver detailing. I would definitely recommend the Ford Escape to someone who is looking for a middle size vehicle! "
4846, 2 years ago,1,Worst car. Yes I had two but the 2nd was a lemon. So many issues and it was so frustrating. I didn't even bother with the class action lawsuit because it was so much effort.
4847, 2 years ago,5,I think this is a smooth car. The way it drives is smooth and eco friendly. Had a good amount of space
4848, 2 years ago,4,It was very nice insides the seats the dashboard the flooring this car was easy to drive it felt like i wasn’t driven it was just smooth sailing Ford Fusion
4849, 2 years ago,5,"Love the new auto start, the Bluetooth connection. Heated seats, the navigation. The down side is i dont really care for how my Samsung looks like on the touch screen. Its was different from an iPhone"
4850, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. Ford Fusion is just perfect for me and all my needs. I love speed and it’s fast and smooth car. I feel very safe driving and I recommend for everyone. It’s not a expensive car at all!!
4851, 2 years ago,4,It’s an okay car for daily use. Good on gas mileage. Comfortably suits 4 but enough room for 5.
4852, 2 years ago,5,This is such a cop car everybody would always stare like if it was the cops right behind them
4853, 2 years ago,4,It was a good car and I loved it until the Air Conditioner went out and it was going to be to expensive to fix so I got rid of it
4854,2 years ago,4,"I used to have a Ford Fiesta old model, a few years ago, but I have also rented during the holidays. I love the car and the brand, they are small, easy to park, affordable and excellent for new drivers. That was actually my first car and I used to drive it on a small road with many bends to go to work every day, up in the mountain at 700mm high in a Natural Park."
4855, 2 years ago,5,I love my fusion! It’s reliable and has all the features I wanted when I got it. The seats are comfortable and there is plenty of room in the back seat for passengers. Lots of trunk room for if I’m moving or getting groceries. My car gets great gas mileage ranging from about 28 mpg to 32 mpg. I always feel safe driving my car!
4856, 2 years ago,4,"All around good car, we haven't had many complaints. I would change the footwell heaters since they only blow from one side. Also, the seat belts lock up when it's too cold outside."
4857, 2 years ago,1,I Hated my Ford Focus. I owned a 2012 and it had constant transmission issues. I had the car in the shop over 7 times. I had broken down with power but no power to the engine and transmission would not go twice in very dangerous situations. DO NOT BUY 
4858, 2 years ago,3,"This gets great gas mileage depending on the size of the engine, but it's not very comfortable and their is the same amount of space to store stuff in the back of your car as their is in a typical 4 door sedan. Mini-suvs are useless."
4859, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. It’s been my absolute dream car from the beginning. The room is perfect for three kids. I love it.
4860,2 years ago,5,"I have the 2011 Ford Escape Limited 4WD. I love this car. I’ve put over 230,000 km on it and it’s still going strong. I’ve only had to make one major repair to the driver side steering control arm, which was not too costly. I love how this SUV feels like a truck and can handle all sorts of bumps, potholes, and streetcar tracks. I am sad they changed the styling of the original Ford Escape because I’m not a fan of crossover type vehicles."
4861, 2 years ago,3,Ford fusion had lots of room but we had issue after issue with rusting and oil leaks very early on probably will never buy a escape again just because we had alot of minor inconveniences come up constantly.
4862,2 years ago,3,"Every since I was little I have loved the Ford mustang, but that's the ONLY Ford I like! The mustang is probably the best car out there, no matter what year it is. But my favorite is the 1967-69 version!"
4863, 2 years ago,4,"Dependable car for a cheap price tag. Great car for a young driver or student. Handles well in snow and rain, especially for a small car."
4864, 2 years ago,4,"Comfortable car, nice internal layout, good amount of space, looks nice, handles well, not overly noisy at higher speeds."
4865,2 years ago,5,"I love this car. I've been an Happy owner for 6 years now. It has been the easiest car to drive in till now. Is perfect for the city. It Is not to big so Is easy ti park.
I've recently made a 6 hours trip with it, and had no issues. I spend €25 every two weeks in petrol.
It Is a Little bit low and of you live in a city where the streets aren't great you would feel every hole."
4866,2 years ago,5,David says one of my favorite SUV for Ford I like it a lot it’s a great comfortable of family coming
4867, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car, I drive it when going out or to work. I love how I don’t use so much gas and it’s good for the environment. I don’t like how I have to charge the car every so often but it’s so worth it."
4868, 2 years ago,5,"Un auto más elegante de Ford, perfecto para personas formales y que les gusta mostrar presencia, también es apto para salir a carreteras sin ningún problema, es completamente aceptable el precio si eres un veterano automotriz.
Sin duda de los mejores autos que tiene Ford."
4869, 2 years ago,5,"El Ford popular por excelencia, muy común pero distinguido con un diseño super característico de la marca, excelente opción para pocos pasajeros y como primer auto.
Tiene el toque juvenil y la seguridad que es necesaria.
Es una de las mejores opciones en cuanto precio."
4870, 2 years ago,5,"Un auto amplio y familiar, la desventaja es que al ser una camioneta se gasta más en combustible pero su potencia en motor es indiscutible, posee una amplia cajuela, incluso cabe alguien más sentado en ella.
Un auto que sin duda es el completo perfecto para una familia pequeña."
4871, 2 years ago,4,I did like this model of Ford. However the price point seems so steep for such a basic model
4872, 2 years ago,5,Ford f150. Lots of room love all the additional gadgets in the 2016 model couldn't get over the room in the full cab. Take about 100 dollars to fill if you drive alot but not to bad. A little more expensive but not the worst price out there. Would recommend if you're a Ford person
4873, 2 years ago,4,"My Ford Focus does it’s job! I got it because it gets great gas milage, which is helpful for a college student. However, I wish it had cruise control and that all the windows were automatic. Other than that, it’s a great little car that gets its job done. If you need a car that is great on gas, this is the car for you."
4874, 2 years ago,4,"I like Fords, they are great cars, including the Escape. Pros are they it has nice upgrade options, reasonable price and good warranty. Cons are that depending on how big your family is, I might not have enough room for extras (pets, camping or sports gear). But a great comfortable choice."
4875, 2 years ago,5,"I love my ford Escape.  I wouldn't trade her for anything.  I have a 2016 titan.  So beautiful, roomy and great to drive.  Everyone who rides in my car cannot believe how roomy inside it is and how the ride is so smooth.  And when I step on it they can't believe the energy she has.  I love her so much I named her Ms. Pearl!!!  And great gas mileage too."
4876, 2 years ago,4,"The car itself it a really good car, excellent mileage. Although I am not an actual fan of the company itself."
4877, 2 years ago,5,My hubby have this car and is an electric ⚡️ he loved and I see he is so happy with it
4878, 2 years ago,3,"We own a 2012 Ford Fusion. This car has been very reliable but the number of recalls is alarming. Very large car, great for a family. Was a very smooth ride when we purchased it new. Overall, no major issues that weren't easy to fix over the years. But, I give it 3 stars for all the recalls."
4879, 2 years ago,5,"Have been driving a mustang for a few years, and I have nothing bad to say. We do have a recall on the air bags that need to be replaced, and Ford is definitely great on reminding safety matters as we have been receiving them nonstop to take it in for the air bags. Love the car!"
4880,2 years ago,5,"I purchased this vehicle new. It has fabulous gas mileage and is great on the budget. However, it is not a family vehicle"
4881, 2 years ago,5,I absolutely love this car. I honestly was only interested in it because of its color-lime green-but I've never had any problems with it. It's not so great to fit a family of 4 into but as a first car or a work car it's great. I'm going to ride it until it dies and I would absolutely buy another.
4882,2 years ago,5,"Great mileage, reliable, and comfortable.  Rides nicely and has a great sound system.  The extended moon roof comes in handy on those great sunny days.  The trunk is very spacious and with folding back seats, is excellent for those larger purchases.  An economically smart purchase."
4883, 2 years ago,4,"My dad has a focus wagon, its very very roomy, as he carries his work equiptment. The color choices are pretty standard, so I think adding some new ones may appeal to more buyers.  The backseat is comfortable with still alot of trunk space room.  The controls on the inside are easy to figure out as well."
4884,2 years ago,5,"I owned a 2004 ford f250 7.3 liter diesel engine. These trucks are reliable, strong and the motors are good for 500,000 miles plus! I highly recommend"
4885,2 years ago,4,"We used these vehicles at work, they are comfortable and roomy enough to comfortable seat four. Acceleration is smooth and just enough personalizable settings to be comfortable and enjoy driving but not so many that it takes forever to adjust settings since multiple people drove the car"
4886, 2 years ago,5,"I purchased a 2015 Fusion new. I just traded it in on a 2019 Fusion. I love these cars. The MPG, the get up and go they have, and the features are nice. I drive 140 miles a day back and forth to work, so this car is basically my 2nd home."
4887, 2 years ago,4,"2011 Fusion Owner - it has been a good ride. I bought used in 2014 with 80k miles on it. I have racked up over 200k miles at this point and within the last year and currently have had some issues. It has mostly been affordable up until December of last year when I needed the front end replaced underneath. Most recently, the driver side door inside has broken and needed replacement. Overall, it did good for the purpose it needed. I would possibly repurchase a Ford in the future. "
4888, 2 years ago,4,Decent car. Not crazy about ford models. It was comfortable decent power motor wise. Nice features. Does not seem to last as long quality wise.
4889, 2 years ago,5,"I bought a 2004 ford focus zx3 about 6 years ago and I love it!  I do yearly maintenance with Ford company with their 12 point car inspection ang it includes getting  your oil changed and all fluids checked and filled.  I have not had one problem at all with my car.  It is a smaller car, it's a door doir, plus hatchback and despite the smaller size, I have fit everything and anything in my car.  Gas is amazing too and last and very long time.  Great economical car if your looking for one.  It is a 4 cylinder but has feel injection, so speed is no issue at all.  I highly recommend!"
4890, 2 years ago,5,I had a 2005 escape and I loved it so much I went and bought a new one! This is the perfect reliable car for any teen or small family!
4891, 2 years ago,4,I drove a friend's Ford Fusion a few times I was really impressed with the car overall. I like the Microsoft Dash and entertainment system a lot. How to smooth ride on the interior quality was really nice
4892, 2 years ago,4,I own this car for about 2 years before someone crashed into me and it was totaled. The car held up nicely and it was a 2010 model. I had no complaints
4893, 2 years ago,3,For a small car it is very roomy on the inside. Decent on gas mileage. The back seat has good leg room and nice trunk space
4894, 2 years ago,5,"LOVED MY FOCUS!!! I felt safe, got great gas mileage, and was able to lease it for a price that fit in my budget and lifestyle. I got the cold weather package which is KEY if you live somewhere where it snows. If I were to change one thing, it would be the default tires that come on it - they arent the best on ice."
4895, 2 years ago,5,It's a great little car that gets my child and I from going A to point B. Actually love that a full tank of gas will last me a week between commuting to school and regular activities. Reliable car.
4896, 2 years ago,4,It's really junky and totaled but it still tries its best. It gets great gas mileage
4897, 2 years ago,5,This car is just what i needed as a starter car and to have get me where i need with no issues
4898, 2 years ago,4,I feel safe in my #Ford Focus. Its the perfect size for me. #smallcompact. Very good gas mileage. Ive had a couple problems with the steering system. Wonder if thats a defect of the car. Very affordable i recommend this car to any busy #momOntherun.
4899, 2 years ago,5,Amazing vehicle that is equipped with anything and everything you might need to conquer a the road! I really have to compliment the handling on this car as it is impeccable and I have never owned a car that reacts so well to me. Highly recommend and not too expensive either!
4900, 2 years ago,5,"i love my fiesta! i got it when my first car, a hyundai santa fe, dies on me. i find that i fill up my gas tank maybe once a month. i’ve had my car a little over a year and i have no complaints so far. i like the way it drives. it is a bit of a smaller car though, so keep that in mind."
4901, 2 years ago,4,I got the opportunity ride this Ford focus I think about a month ago it drove really really great and I really liked it ￼
4902, 2 years ago,4,I rented a Ford focus for a few days.  I think it is a good car.  Economical and with a good internal space.  It has good handling.  I like the brand.
4903, 2 years ago,4,Very sturdy car. I drive the Ford Escape Hybrid 2005. I accidently broke it because I did not add enough oil in the engine and bought another Ford Escape. Same year and everything and am now experiencing some sounds and clicking from it. I would give the car 5/5 if the current problem I'm dealing with wouldn't have occured 
4904, 2 years ago,3,"we've had a lot of trouble with the transmission But in the other hand the car is spacious , gas saver so that’s why I gave it 3 stars ⭐️"
4905, 2 years ago,5,My moms owns this car but I’ve driven it quite a few times. Comfortable and stylish! Gas mileage is pretty good on this vehicle.
4906, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVED my fiesta! It was small and perfect size for me. However my 6ft friends were a little cramped and the hatchback space wasn’t too big but it fit what I needed! It was excellent on gas mileage too! I would go sometimes 2+ weeks on gas not needing to fill up. However on some of the older models there is a transmission glitch. It doesn’t hurt the car, it just shudders shifting gears."
4907, 2 years ago,5,"I love this vehicle. So spacious yet so compact, I love how easy it is to set up your mobile device for music. They also offer so many hand free options which I find extremely accessible and convenient "
4908, 2 years ago,5,"Loved being a passenger, as much as I assume the driver loved driving it! Music in a vehicle is a big thing for me so once i found how easy it was to connect my device, that was all i needed!"
4909, 2 years ago,5,My parents have this car and love it. It drives very smooth and the seating is pretty comfortable for both driver and passenger
4910,2 years ago,4,I like my car but had problems with the rear camera almost immediately it just comes and goes   pro the gas is great it tells me how many miles I have until empty and is pretty nice inside. The cons would be the sketchy camera
4911, 2 years ago,5,"My Escape was the first car I purchased for myself after college and she (I like to call her Ginger) has been amazing! I love how much space I have within the seats, and also the feature of folding my back seats down for extra room in the trunk. The gas mileage is pretty solid for a small SUV and my rides are very smooth!"
4912, 2 years ago,4,It’s nice but it’s bulky. I’m a small person and I feel really small in this car. It only seats 5 for how spacious it feels. It’s pretty expensive for a ford and wouldn’t be something I would consider for myself.
4913, 2 years ago,3,"The Fusion is a great car for being a Ford. But I've never really had good luck with Fords. But, overall the car has a great entertainment package. But the ride isnt as smooth as it could be. And I feel like theres not much trunk space compared to competitor cars."
4914, 2 years ago,3,"Very reliable and economical cars, cheap to run and maintain due to popularity. However can be perceived badly in young drivers due to popularity with drug dealers"
4915, 2 years ago,5,"Ford Focus was one of my favorite cars that I have owned. They are very affordable. They are very easy to work on and when work needed to be done, it didn't cost me an outstanding amount. It was great on gas and drove like a dream. I would definitely recommend to everyone! Ford Focus"
4916, 2 years ago,5,"I own the Titanium trim level and I love it. I love the heating and cooling seats, heated steering wheel moon roof, etc. Out of everything using the Ford Pass app to start my car may be my favorite"
4917,2 years ago,5,"If you want to buy American, buy Ford! My son works for them, and recommended this car for me. She's sweet and does the job well, safely, and swiftly. She's also affordable."
4918, 2 years ago,4,It's very comfortable and AC working is just superb. Aluminium cool looking wheels gives the car an amazing look....
4919, 2 years ago,5,"I love my little fiesta, it drives incredibly smooth. Heated seats are probably my favorite as I used to live in Alaska. It is a very compact vehicle so if you have a large family I wouldn’t recommend."
4920, 2 years ago,4,"I love this car. It’s a nice, efficient car. It has the new features, but could use a little more leg room. I noticed it does get a little uncomfortable if you have long legs and you’re in it for long periods of time. But a total gas saver, and haven’t had tons of mechanical issues which is great!"
4921,2 years ago,5,"i love this ford escape . it is easy on gas, a lot of room inside . it is a little light weight in bad weather tho ,rain & snow.  it is very reasonably priced & affordable "
4922, 2 years ago,4,Great on gas and also feels very safe. I like more compact cars so it’s nice to drive a car that’s smaller
4923, 2 years ago,5,I drive my family’s Ford Escape quite often. It’s a 2016 Ford Escape and drives quite smoothly and efficiently. This car has a great sound system and it pretty gas friendly as well. I definitely recommend getting the Ford Escape!
4924, 2 years ago,3,"Me gusta el carro   es económico de la gasolina casi no gasta, es un carro muy cómodo y fácil de usar  y puedo ir a cualquier lugar y , recomendó todos los productos  que compro aquí siempre sirven muy bien ya que si sirve es muy eficaz , estoy satisfecha"
4925, 2 years ago,4,A great car. Small but comfy and casual. Not too fancy but not cheap. It has a slick look to it and can hold 5 passengers. It comes in multiple different colors and uses gas respectively. I would recommend.
4926, 2 years ago,2,"I am personally not in love with cars. I prefer SUVs. However for a starter car, this is perfect!"
4927, 2 years ago,5,Great little starter car. Good gas mileage and affordable. Cute car nice colors. Drives smooth.
4928, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car it is a little small on the inside but it gets great gas mileage, i can fill it up for 20 dollars. Like i said i would like the inside to be a bit bigger. I think it was pretty affordable. I would definitely recommend this car because of the gas mileage and back up camera."
4929, 2 years ago,3,This car was a good riding car with plenty of room.  The only con I had with this vehicle was mechanical.  I had more trouble with this company car than any other car I had over the years.  I was very glad when I was due for a new company car.  I was thankful I was not responsible for paying for the repairs.
4930, 2 years ago,1,If I could give the Focus and Ford negative stars I would.  Do not buy!  I have had nothing but problems with my Focus which was brand new off the lot in 2014.  It has engine troubles which Ford knew they had and they were still selling them.  They fixed the problem with a bandaid fix and it happened again.  The dealer wanted $4000 to fix.  Wth?!?  Ford sucks.  Don't even get me started on my husband's escape.  #ford #fordfocus #fordsucks #dontbuyaford
4931, 2 years ago,2,I hated this car. The transmission went out on my way to a dental and I barely made it back to the dealership. Repairs were always a pain and I will never own another Ford again.
4932, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford Escape is smaller than the Explorer. But you get some of the height that comes with a SUV, and the inside is bigger than a Sedan but not much. I prefer the Ford Explorer."
4933, 2 years ago,4,"My 2017 Ford Fusion SE is 4 cylinder and is stronger than I remember 4 cylinders being.  But just as the warranty expired, all kind of problems are arising.  Hearing a Thunk, as the car attempts to change gear, so I went to Super Lube got a oil change and ask them to check the transmission fluid and top it off as needed.  Well they finally had to tell me and my husband that this car has to be taken to a mechanic to add transmission fluid.  Are you kidding!  It has taught me to ask more questions when purchasing anything."
4934, 2 years ago,5,I love my car! It’s so safe and it’s a good size that makes me feel safe. It is really good on gas! From school to home and to work I still have a full tank. I love my car and always recommend as a first car
4935, 2 years ago,4,A nice smaller car at a good price: it has a lot of good options and is very comfortable
4936, 2 years ago,5,A nice sized suv that is comfortable for 7 people. It has a lot of nice options and is good for families
4937, 2 years ago,3,"I have a 2012 Ford Focus Hatchback SE and I love the way it drives, it is a very smooth ride. The reason I give it 3 stars is because the back seat has virtually no leg room which makes it difficut got passengers to be comfortable."
4938, 2 years ago,5,My friend has one of these. I love her car but to me personally its somewhat small. I would love it if it had just a little more room but the interior is amazing and it drives like a dream.
4939, 2 years ago,4,"Broke down and bought an SUV cuz my kid is gonna be like 6'5"". Way better than the piece of sh... cars I have been driving. Most important... Car play. Cuz music. And I have no sense of direction. Oh, seat warmers. Cold blowing in your face. But a warm asssssss."
4940, 2 years ago,5,My best friend's dad owned this car and we usually go road trips with it and I really enjoyed it. I really liked the Bluetooth service the car had
4941,2 years ago,5,"My grandparents own a Ford Escape, so it technically isn't even my car, haha. But it does have a ton of features that my handicapped grandma uses, including that it is very easy for her to get in and out of. That control panel is super easy to use and once I explained it to her, she understood easily! The headlights adjust automatically, which helps a LOT for both my grandmother and me because of our astigmatism. The seat does adjust in height and that's a miracle for someone as short as I am. The seats are fairly easy to lay down in the back, and they also provide a lot of room for my brother and his car seat when we travel. I learned to drive in their car and it is such a smooth ride that I hate driving other vehicles. The Ford Escape is a lovely option for everyone!"
4942, 2 years ago,5,Mom has one and we love it. Good gas mileage. Smooth. Low maintenance. Nice features.
4943, 2 years ago,5,Cute little crossover. Smooth. Good gas mileage. Adorable. Would be a good first car for a youngster.
4944, 2 years ago,5,I like the escape nice and roomy. Its not to big or small. Like that you can fold down seat in the back. The back cargo space it really big. I kboaw i can fit up to 800$ if stuff from sam club in the ford escape. Alao use it to go camping in. It has plenty room space your not to crowned. Very nice to drive and ride smooth
4945, 2 years ago,5,This was my dad's favorite car it had everything my dad liked in a car. I loved the family feel the car had even though it was a small car.
4946, 2 years ago,5,This little car can pack a punch! It’s cute and comfy! It can surprisingly hold quite a bit in the back.  My favorite is the hatch back hides the contents of the trunk for safe keeping.  I would definitely consider buying this car for my next vehicle
4947, 2 years ago,5,Looks and feels cool and decently expensive. Drives well and the speakers are super nice. Interior is good and so is the space on the inside.
4948, 2 years ago,5,Fiancee's mother had this car. Great mileage. We went everywhere in that car when he was borrowing it. I would buy this car for myself. It was awesome
4949,2 years ago,2,"This was my first car and it had so many problems. The repair bills well exceeded its value, and it had to be towed at least 5 times within the last few years for various problems and parts that went bad. Very unreliable"
4950, 2 years ago,4,Good vehicle does its job. New engine with the eco boost did not expect that this vehicle has a lot of torque. Space is okay and best bang for your buck for the power and size as mid size SUV is getting competitive
4951, 2 years ago,2,"Not as spacious as the focus, but seems to have less mechanical problems. I personally don't love them."
4952,2 years ago,2,I d ok not personally own an escape I have only ever been a passenger but with that being said I do not find it to be a comfortable car. It is very cramped and the interior design is just awkwardly done.
4953, 2 years ago,4,"Smooth drive, plenty of room and great features included  Back up camera is a blessing  The back seems to sit high or just not a very big window in back. "
4954, 2 years ago,2,"I have a 2013, and while I love the car, it has had a plethora of mechanical issues. There has been more recalls than I can count and the dealerships are so rude about fixing them."
4955, 2 years ago,4,Great car.  It is a great driving car/nice handling.  It has nice features and is easy to use.
4956, 2 years ago,5,I bought my husband a 2012 Ford F150 for his birthday 2 years ago and I have never been a ford person. But I love the truck. I drive it more than he does.
4957, 2 years ago,3,Works for a single person or a married couple with no kids. It’s not idea for family. How it’s perfect for college or school  even long distance travels. Gets great gas mileage and if affordable compared to other make/ brand.
4958, 2 years ago,4,Great car drove nicely gas was great. Just wasn’t enough room for my family and dog we have
4959, 2 years ago,1,"My friend has had nothing but issues with her car. It is tiny and cramped and the mechanical issues are just the icing on top. If you're a single person looking for a cheap car, this may be for you, though the resale value is very low. I personally would never own one."
4960, 2 years ago,5,"I have a 2014 F150 with the 5.0L motor. I had only owned cars prior and was a little nervous about getting a truck, but the cab is spacious enough for 2 kids, 2 adults and 2 dogs with the passenger side rear seat flipped up. It has been insanely reliable for us on long road trips, handles well in the winter and gets really reasonable fuel mileage. Will definitely buy another Ford in the future."
4961,2 years ago,5,It’s a fav car of mine! More pricey but a good reliable car in my opinion! Highly recommended
4962,2 years ago,5,I love my little fiesta! It’s good on gas and gets me where I need to be! I love it!
4963, 2 years ago,4,"The Ford Fushion is a beast!! I love test driving cars and this one was fully equipped loaded V8 with some power!!
It drove so smooth as a Lexus but cut the price. The Fushion is affordable and built by Ford so I personally highly recommend getting a new car!!"
4964, 2 years ago,4,"Stylish car, smooth drive, prefer this car in white. Enough space for the whole family.  Advanced in technology"
4965, 2 years ago,4,"This car offers a smooth and comfortable ride,  large boot enough space for all goods, the backseat aswell as front seats are comfortable."
4966, 2 years ago,3,"I've only ever been a passenger in a Ford Mustang. I was impressed with the build, but personally owned a Chevy camaro. They definitely can make a beautiful body of the mustang, I've enjoyed watching them change over the years. Wouldn't break my Chevy bond for one though."
4967,2 years ago,4,I think it was a very nice car and it drives really smooth. A pro is that it saves a ton of gas. I would improve by making them eco-friendly and they are very affordable cars totally would recommend this car￼
4968, 2 years ago,4,Omg these are fast and beautiful ! There a little roomy to me (: and the gas is okay too
4969,2 years ago,5,I got a 2012 Ford Focus Titanium for my first car and I still have it. I love it some people say they have transmission problems but I haven’t noticed any. It is great on gas and gas a lot of power for a 4 cylinder engine.
4970, 2 years ago,5,First I have to say I am a huge Ford fan. My next car will be the Ford SUV because of of the extra room for a growing family. Every year these continue to become more affordable price and super cute for mom always on the go! I recommend getting a Ford for myself!
4971, 2 years ago,3,"These engines are not built very well. The 1.6L has a lot of mechanical issues and the older body styles really show their age. Ford has done a good job redoing the Escape with the new body style. I still feel it doesnt look American, it doesnt drive American and it doesnt feel that way either. It needs to be less European and more gritty."
4972, 2 years ago,3,EHi was a little bit more fun to get the stuff out and stuff I would do have stuff for me the money and I have no idea why it
4973, 2 years ago,5,"Ford's are the most reliable awesome everyday cars ever made in my opinion, my dad always drove them and so j ok new when I started driving that's what I'd drive"
4974, 2 years ago,5,"Ford are one of the most reliable car manufacturers on the planet in my opinion, my dad always drove Ford's or Vauxhall's and I'll always love them."
4975, 2 years ago,3,"It seems like every other month my husband's Focus has a recall. It has been a good vehicle overall but with all of the recalls, it worries me when it may fall apart or just stop working all together!"
4976,2 years ago,5,"Even tho mine is older. He my car has close to 200,000 miles. HE is still going. He is normally called Frankie. I do my oil change every 1,500 miles. Frankie is a 2011 style. Good on gas."
4977, 2 years ago,5,"My husband and I were looking for a sensible SUV! We don't have children but we love to travel and we wanted more space. We were worried about the gas mileage that an SUV may get, but this is amazing! We love our new car!"
4978, 2 years ago,5,I absolutely LOVE my Ford Flex!! There is so much room with the 3 rows. We are an active sports family and with multiple softball bags as well as our coolers and other items there is still plenty of room for all passengers. The cost is extremely affordable for the quality of the vehicle. I will most likely continue to buy the newer models of the Flex as it is one of the best vehicles I have ever driven. I can not say enough great things about the Flex. Perfect family car!!!!
4979, 2 years ago,4,"This car drives extremely smooth. I would absolutely love to have this car, the only thing I wasn’t to fond of was the blind spots."
4980, 2 years ago,3,Great little car to start with. Its low to the ground and can definitely go pretty fast for a tiny car. Tjlhe cons are that if you take a turn too fast it does feel like you will tip over but overall the steering is quite controlled and is a great car for a teenager or a first time buyer.
4981, 2 years ago,3,"As a passenger I was intrigued to ride in this vehicle as I was exploring downsizing my suv. I have owned multiple Ford Explorers in the last and was hopeful that this would be similar. I honestly found my experience to be rather underwhelming. The inside seemed basic, the front seating area felt less roomy than passenger cars I have owned and it didn’t have much pick up. Add that to not having any towing capacity or option for third row seat, it’s just not the vehicle for me."
4982,2 years ago,4,I drove in a ford fiesta when I was taking my driving lessons and I loved everything about the car except the loud noise it'd make when I started the engine. Other than that I really liked the car though i was scared to drive it because it was big for me.
4983,2 years ago,5,"I loved my Ford Fusion. The only thing I didn’t love was that it was hard to get a stroller in and out of the trunk. What I did love was the amount of space that I had inside of the car. Also, it was very clean and sheek on the inside."
4984,2 years ago,3,I love the concept of this car. It’s layout is nice. And everything is sheek. I also love how big the trunk is. What I’m not super fond of is how tight the space is in the car itself. Especially whenever you add car seats. You have barley any leg room upfront once you add a rear-facing car seat.
4985, 2 years ago,4,"Nice little car, easy to handle. Easy on the roads. Only 4 stars because once the locking mechanism goes in one of the doors it’s $500+ to fix every time, and even the ford dealership told me it can keep happening."
4986, 2 years ago,4,Good rental car. This was a long time ago but I distinctly remember being happy because it was as good as the Hyundai elanta I once hand.
4987, 2 years ago,5,I've owned several Ford vehicles and I truly believe they are one of the top vehicles to have. Highly recommend!
4988, 2 years ago,4,"Great little car for a beginning driver! Safe, reliable and affordable. Rides smooth and is comfy. Would recommend."
4989, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car! It's not too big but not too small either! Have tons of cargo room for craft projects, fishing or travelling!"
4990, 2 years ago,3,I am not a Ford girl at all I'm more of a Chrysler or GMC I do like a couple of Ford vehicles and I am driving a Ford now that I'm kind of forced to drive and it seems to be doing the job pretty well so my rating may change in the future I do like the look of the new Ford truck
4991, 2 years ago,4,I've have had zero mechanical issues with this car. I just wish it had more space and the gas mileage that it advertised.  The inside kind of looks and feels a bit cheap to me for the price.
4992, 2 years ago,1,Worst car I have ever had in my life transmission fails every year like clock work isn’t covered by lawsuit for this issue until third time of same reasoning list@goes on
4993, 2 years ago,4,"Cute small car, would be great for first time drivers. It’s just the right size for me (5’1) has the back up camera, a nice sized trunk. This was my mother’s car but I would drive it at times."
4994,2 years ago,5,My mom has this vehicle and I’ve driven it a few times.  I have no complaints at all.  It’s a nice smooth ride and easy to maneuver.
4995, 2 years ago,5,I owned a 2012 Escape and absolutely loved it. It was totaled a few years ago and I didn’t like the body style of the newer Escapes. I bought a different brand and regret it. I should have stuck with Ford.
4996, 2 years ago,2,"This was the second car that I had ever owned. At the beginning I was extremely happy with my purchase. However, a few months after purchase my car began surging and shuttering. I took it back to the dealership and had to have the transmission module replaced. During my three years of having this vehicle the module was replaced three times. Would not recommend this vehicle, I do not feel that it would be reliable, especially for someone who drives alot or has a far commute."
4997, 2 years ago,5,"Feels very comfortable, I really enjoyed all my journey trips with this type of car."
4998, 2 years ago,5,"Great car! Amazing on gas, great features. It is a bit small inside not a lot of leg room especially if you have children in car seats it’s definitely not enough room. Sadly had to upgrade to something more roomy. It is a great car overall, I’ll personally miss the driver seat it had some great settings, I’m 4’11 and this car was perfect size I could see everything in front. No having to push myself up to see the road. Great car for a small person."
4999, 2 years ago,5,We decided to upgrade this year because we are now a family of 4 and our littles need space from each other. This vehicle gets amazing gas mileage and has plenty of room for a family vacation. I am so overly hapoy with the comfor of this vehicle and knowing my family is safe.
5000, 2 years ago,3,I love my car even tho its 2009. I cant seem to get rid of it. No major problem as of yet. Its my second car that i paid off. Its nice and spacious for me.
5001, 2 years ago,2,I give a 2 because its at least a car to frive and get you to point a to point b. But in reality they are garbage. They have so many problems and they are proven to be unreliable. I will never choose to buy a Ford. I would rather walk than drive around in a vehicle that you dont know what could happen in it.
5002, 2 years ago,5,"Ford has been for years one of the top selling automobiles. Very sporty, reliable, holds resale for years. We will be purchasing a new one within the year."
5003, 2 years ago,4,My ford escape is good on gas. It is large enough for a family but still small enough to not be too overwhelming. It has the turbo for just enough get up and go. It is affordable and just right!
5004, 2 years ago,5,love this car. great on gas. we are moving so we towed a trailer from Michigan to south Carolina and had no problems.
5005,2 years ago,4,"I love my escape! I've had it for almost two years now, getting ready to trade it in here in a few months and we have never had any problems with it. I will miss it when it's gone. The only thing I don't love is how easily the upholstery gets so dirty so easily, getting it detailed all the time. But otherwise it's the most reliable car I've ever had."
5006, 2 years ago,5,The Ford Escape is a great SUV. It is both stylish and comfortable. It suits all of our transportation needs. As a family of 5 we are able to all comfortably fit when traveling .
5007,2 years ago,3,"It's a bit small for a 4 door vehicle, but will get you from A to B with good mileage. This would be a great car for a single young person, or married without children."
5008, 2 years ago,5,Love my 2012 Ford Fusion! Has a ton of miles but still runs like a champ! I use this as my work vehicle. Gets great gas mileage. Super affordable maintainability.
5009, 2 years ago,4,"Not super big, but great trunk space, amazing gas mileage and extremely dependable! Use as a daily driver, or for long trips and vacation, this car will get you to point A, B, & C With ease! Do I reccomend it? Yes, of course I do! It's cheaper, great mpg and dependable, why wouldn't I?"
5010, 2 years ago,4,"Its Roomy, has great gas mileage, dependable, and really great prices! It was my friends vehicle but I definitely would look into buying one! I recommend this as a daily driver or great family vehicle! Its gorgeous as well, definitely recommend buying it!"
5011, 2 years ago,5,great affordable car i have nothing else to say it does his job well. and you can definitely keep this car like 4-10 years!
5012, 2 years ago,5,I used to lease a Ford Escape back when it was designed more like a truck. It was my favorite car I owned. Had really cool ambient lighting and a great sound system and ample storage.
5013, 2 years ago,5,"Great sedan. Almost wish we hadn't traded it. Good looking, good size, great gas mileage, and very comfortable."
5014, 2 years ago,5,Love it!!! It’s amazing on gas and I feel safe driving it. I’m not to low to the ground like if I was driving a    car
5015, 2 years ago,5,It's a very nice car great for my family. Gas mileage is great! Only had a few recalls but took it to the dealer and got fixed right away. I love that I sync  my phone to my car so handsfree calls and I can play my personal playlisy. We have taken our car on four out of state vacation and it did very well. I like our Ford focus for my family but it's not my first choice lol
5016,2 years ago,5,"Absolutely love my car! It has auto 4x4 , eco and turbo in it. Very nice car. No cons at this time. Very customizable car."
5017,2 years ago,5,"Nice. So I get motion sickness in vehicles that I am not driving 99 percent of the time. In this vehicle with a friend owning and driving it, it is super comfy and we could go a few hours away and back and I felt great riding ad a passenger in this car. It was nice and sporty and peppy to drive as well. Nice sleek look, over all if you can get a good deal on this vehicle in would say ""go for it""  I really like Fords, but I'm a Dodge girl because that's what raised me , so I am loyal to Dodge, but this is a very nice second!!"
5018,2 years ago,3,"I like Fords, I was a passenger several times in a friends vehicle going out of town to Hockey games. This one though was brand new and it wasn't the easiest. Every bump or movement jiggled and jostled me around. In the driver's seat it was not noticable. It looks like a really nice sleek vehicle. If I was buying it purely for being the sole driver it wouldnt be too bad depending on the price, but with many other options out there I do not know if I would go for this.."
5019, 2 years ago,3,Not a big fan on fords but never have been. I will say it does have a good bit of room.
5020, 2 years ago,5,My mom has an Escape and it’s just perfect for her running back and forth to town and running errands
5021, 2 years ago,5,It is not only safe but super reliable with all the tech and features I need. It is my daily driver and is excellent on long drives. It is also great when we went off roading in Arizona.
5022,2 years ago,5,"I currently own 2 Ford's - a 2000 f150 with 250,000 miles on it and still going strong, and a 2009 mustang GT 5 speed.  I would improve the transmission in the f150 because I have replaced it twice.  My 1986 Chevrolet has the original transmission and it will probably still be on the road long after my f150."
5023,2 years ago,2,"I had a rental car and I was driving from SLC to Vegas, about 2.5 hours into my drive the car lost power and left me and my kids stranded on the side of the freeway. Luckily we were close enough that my insurance towed us. Turned out the oil dipstick separated and got stuck in the engine! Typical Ford I guess."
5024, 2 years ago,4,"I just recently got my license, and this was my Dad’s old car before he got his new truck. I believe mine is a 2009 model. I’m unsure about the finances for it, as I’m only in high school, but I would recommend this car for a comfortable drive."
5025, 2 years ago,4,"Rides smooth. I love the car, but my dad refuses to let me get any car ford related. Found on road dead, is what he always says."
5026, 2 years ago,5,I owned a Ford focus for 12 years. I loved the car. It was a hatchback and it could fit so much in it. It was small and easy to park and fit along small City streets! It was a great value for the price. Inexpensive for what it is. I would recommend for anyone who wants a small car that fits a lot and is fun to drive.
5027, 2 years ago,3,"I had a 2007 Escape Hybrid AWD.  It handled ok in the snow.  The hybrid portion of the battery was not pleasant.  It would take a while to get up to speed and felt dangerous when pulling out, if the hybrid battery was engaged.  It had little to no power and was very small inside.  I would not recommend."
5028, 2 years ago,2,"Absolutely hated everything about this car except the look. But it was made extremely cheap it was a 2016 with less than 60,000 miles on it and had the transmission fixed two separate times. Don’t recommend"
5029,2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford ... it is so smooth driving.  And all the ingenuity you have for multimedia is great.
I like everything on it and it is very easy when connecting my cell phone."
5030, 2 years ago,5,"My finance has a Ford focus and over all the car is awesome. Pro: roomy, cute style, navigation, reliable, low maintenance, affordable
Cons: he has the sti version and it can get uncomfortable sitting in the bucket seats over a long period of time"
5031, 2 years ago,3,we got this as a rental during a roadtrip and i couldnt have asked for a better ride. it was so spacious and we loved it
5032, 2 years ago,3,"My Ford Escape had all the issues. It made scary sounds. It didn’t drive smoothly. I loved the size and how comfortable and safe I felt, but it wasn’t worth the trouble I had with the car. Wouldn’t recommend."
5033,2 years ago,4,"There was an old joke a mechanic once asked if I knew what ""FORD"" stood for on vehicle's??F-O-R-D...[F]ix-[O]r-[R]epair-[D]aily..
Lol once I heard that, I subconsciously steered clear from anything FORD when car shopping...
I was 17 when I heard that btw, flash forward 10 years, after totalling my pastime fav. 08' Mitsubishi Lancer and in desperate need of an affordable vehicle ASAP I ended up getting a GREAT deal on an 10' FORD Focus and I have ZERO complaints, or major repairs lol... it's a gas saving, reliable vehicle that I wish I would have"
5034, 2 years ago,4,Decent size care.  More expensive than other comparable sized cars on the market.  Don’t love the look of them.
5035, 2 years ago,3,Decent car.  Not something I would ever buy but I have driven ones that friends have owned.  Don’t love the look of them.  Like the ford interface.  Pretty small.
5036, 2 years ago,4,Great economy small suv. Gets great gas mileage. Has been perfect for my teenage daughter
5037,2 years ago,4,I have really enjoyed my Ford Escape. I have a 2007 model and have had it for around seven years. It has not given me hardly any problems and has held up very nicely. I will continue to drive this car and would definitely be open to purchase one of the newer models when I am in the search for a new car.
5038, 2 years ago,4,"I've rented this car for a week while visiting family.  It was small and easy to drive. However, the trunk space was just small enough not to fit a wheelchair, so that made it a little more difficult to use. I'll be renting something bigger on my next visit to the family for a holiday."
5039, 2 years ago,4,I’ve had a fusion for a few years absolutely love the space and the way it rides with comfort.
5040, 2 years ago,5,"I love it , it’s the perfect size and gets you to point A to point B. It is a great commuter car ."
5041, 2 years ago,5,"It’s ok, I really like it , I wish the trunk was a bit bigger. My care has like a big jump in the back and it’s hard to fit certain things."
5042, 2 years ago,3,Great car! The upgraded Ford Fushion is the perfect car for all ages! Rides quiet and smoothly. Love the more expensive packages as it makes it seem like a luxury car.
5043, 2 years ago,3,Great for a small SUV. The better packages ride smoother. Its good for people who want a smaller vehicle to get around in but still like sitting up higher and having room to transport things place to place.
5044, 2 years ago,5,"Although I have a Toyota, my mother and father have only ever owned Ford vehicles. My mother has the Ford Escape and it is a very nice car! It’s a nice white color and it runs very nicely. Very few to no problems at all! Can’t go wrong with this American brand!"
5045, 2 years ago,5,"This is my husband favorite truck and also mine good for  heavy stuff  can be use for work , very soft to drive inside is really simple"
5046, 2 years ago,5,We actually got this as a rental on the way to the beach. It had more room than I thought it would and the gas mileage wasn’t bad. It got us to our destination safely and we didn’t feel cramped during the ride.
5047,2 years ago,4,"These last forever. I remember riding in this one when I was young. It lasted a long time. It like many other cars in my family was purchased used, I believe."
5048, 2 years ago,5,"I enjoyed this car every second! It’s affordable, has great mileage, and is unleaded. My 2015 had Bluetooth and all the bells and whistles, it was the most convenient and affordable as a college student."
5049,2 years ago,5,Love Fords. Good on gas and very roomy. No problems with this vehicle at all. My mom has one and I've been in it numerous times.
5050, 2 years ago,5,My dads car So I drive it every now and then :D its a little different for me as its a 4x4 unlike my car so sometimes I feel its not for me lol
5051, 2 years ago,5,"Cómodas, con buen espacio, gran variedad d Colores Ford es de lo mejor en el mercado."
5052, 2 years ago,5,"Me encanta este Modelo. Sencillo o elegante La Marca Ford es de lo mejor qué hay en el mercado,"
5053, 2 years ago,5,This car is super great! My dad drove it for a while and enjoyed it before he passed it on to me. I have had it for several years now and It’s a smooth ride.
5054, 2 years ago,4,I only rode passenger of the Ford Focus. I thought the interior was very nice. The seats were comfortable. I really liked the layout of the dash and all of the extra electronic features.
5055,2 years ago,4,My mom had a Ford escape and it was a really nice roomy car the only thing was after she had had it for about 5 to 7 years that clutch kept going out so she ate up ultimately need to get a new car.
5056, 2 years ago,5,"Ok, so we bought a ford escape at the end of last year. We couldnt agree on a car until we found an escape. The panoramic sunroof and leather heated seats. The ambiance lighting, and the price couldn't be beat. By far my favorite car ever"
5057,2 years ago,5,"My stepmkm has a F150, its a nice trk. Comfortable and roomy. Im not a Fors person so ..I cant say much more.."
5058,2 years ago,5,"Truly never have had an issue that wasn't my fault. No check engine lights, no drivability issues, no leaks. Bought at 40k, now at 150k. I personally take care of it, maintain it regularly as needed, try not to drive like an idiot, and respect the machine that it is. I know down the line something will probably happen simply due to age but I'll never stop raving about the luck I've had with my tuxedo-black-painted baby!"
5059, 2 years ago,5,This was my first car 30 years ago and I decided that I would love another one when I no longer was driving children.  It is a nice economical car that gets me from mall to mall.
5060, 2 years ago,5,I have had two Ford Fusions and one Focus.  We have always trusted Ford to bring us safely home.  We always get a good deal and appointments with dealer are always good and timely.   We get emails on promotions and call backs can be a hassle but they do their best to get you out of there on time.
5061,2 years ago,5,"Great car, lots of space in the boot for shopping :) ideal family car. I love how comfortable the seats are and how nice it is to drive. Very reliable and economical for those that do alot of travelling. Overall I would rate it 10/10 for a nice looking car with all the added perks :)"
5062, 2 years ago,4,I love ford I have also always been a ford girl and I love them. My dad has had his 2004 since he got it back then and it still runs perfectly!
5063, 2 years ago,3,"I took it out for a test drive. Liked the look and feel of this vehicle, but had trouble viewing cars behind me.  I did not feel safe."
5064,2 years ago,5,"Reliable, it’s great on gas and it’s rarely ever given me problems! My mom owns a Ford Focus and she loves it too! It’s been her car for years and now it’s my cousins car 💙"
5065, 2 years ago,3,It’s a nice car! Great gas mileage and has lots of leg room in the back. I also like the space there is in the trunk. I definitely would buy one if my car seat would have fit in the back. Maybe when my daughter is older!
5066, 2 years ago,4,"I've driven my friend's Ford Focus a few times and it's pretty easy to drive and very smooth on the road. One thing that I do not like though, is how much acceleration you get when you put your foot on the gas just a little bit. Since I wasn't used to driving the car, it gave me a bit of a scare."
5067, 2 years ago,5,My cousin have it n I drove this car too . The best to drive I can say. Inside is good
5068, 2 years ago,1,"I own a 2013 and had three recalls on my car, no biggie. But after those recalls were maintained and ""fixed"" one of those issues still ended up happening to me on my other door. That door was not under recall. 

Driving down the interstate and having both door hinges breaking off causing doors (at two separate times) to fly open was enough to have me hate this car. She has been reliable on gas and distance but that is about all it has going for it over the period of time."
5069, 2 years ago,5,I love my 2011 Fusion Sport ! It’s looks good and has good pick up and go speed ! Mine doesn’t have a lot of features but it’s still a great car.
5070, 2 years ago,5,I needed an SUV and I’m in love with my 2017 Escape Titanium! The sun roof is big and give a lot of light to the car. The touch screen is easy to use !
5071,2 years ago,4,"My first car was a Ford probe. And to me it was a gift from God. I loved that car, I drove it for almost 10 years. Basically, I drove it until the wheels fell off. Overall it was an ok car. Lots of problems with window motors, and headlight mirror too. I was young I could care less, think I used a chopstick to hold it up. I would like to recommend Ford to a friend but do not have enough information to give a review. I can say this, my 1989 Ford Probe was awesome!!"
5072, 2 years ago,5,This is my first car and I love it. As a first time buyer I can’t fault this car at all
5073,2 years ago,4,I own a 2009 Ford Escape and I love it! My dad gave it to me and it’s a great car. It runs well even though it’s 11 years old and it still works great! I drive it everyday and it gets good mileage. It has plenty of space for big loads and foldable seats.
5074, 2 years ago,1,"Good on gas but that’s about it. Transmission issue was well known, and I was penalized when I went to trade it in. It was a Ford issue, that Ford new about. Never again."
5075,2 years ago,4,Great roomy suv. Love the third row seat option. Great on gas n great to travel in. Roomy third row seat love the trunk space
5076, 2 years ago,5,"Smooth driving car with nice interior. Very large inside, good gas mileage and little issues. Very sleek exterior and accelerates easily. Affordable car that lasts forever - even with high mileage."
5077,2 years ago,5,I do not own a ford escape but this is one of my top picks for vehicles that I want. I love the design and style of it and the room factor. This car has plenty of room throughout and plenty of space in the trunk as well. Would definitely recommend this vehicle.
5078,2 years ago,5,My husband and I drove a 2017 for quiet a while and it was a super nice car. The interior was nice and it had heated seats and a heated steering wheel. It was all around a really nice car and was also great with gas mileage. I would totally recommend this car.
5079, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford Fusion! Plenty of space in the car, the trunk is huge, and the driving is so smooth! I dont have anything bad to say about this car."
5080, 2 years ago,3,very nice car i love it just some issues with it and that’s probably just my car i would like to fix this by getting a different one
5081, 2 years ago,5,"Best car I’ve ever owned. Reliable, comfy and great mileage!! Would definitely recommend to friends and family"
5082,2 years ago,3,They are ok. I work for the county and they have these so I know how to fix them pretty good. They are on the cheaper side but will get you where you need to go
5083, 2 years ago,4,I have a very basic model Ford Escape.  It handles well for a small SUV.  I don;t like that it is only front wheel drive.  It is easy to maneuver through the city and is small enough to park easily.  The gad milage is pretty good for this type of car.  But I have had cars that I like better in the past.
5084, 2 years ago,4,For the most part I love my car. It does however have a issue with the clutch and it has been replaced 5 times now.  Ford has been fairly good at fixing it.  The car has a great interior and ot is excellent on fuel.
5085,2 years ago,4,"My Ford Escape gets great gas mileage, hands free driving made easy,  this car has a surprising ""get up & go!""  If you decide on this car, beware of the gas pedal, you can go so fast, so quick, it's crazy! The two downfalls are inside passenger space. And inside storage space. I just really wish there was more! "
5086, 2 years ago,5,"I am obsessed with my Ford Fusion. I recently bought this car for a purpose of safety. I had a smaller car that would drift all over the road, my Ford Fusion is safe and affordable!"
5087, 2 years ago,5,I had an older escape.   I loved that car so much.  It was probably one of my favorite vehicles I owned.  I would definitely purchase again.  The older models.  I do not like the look of the newer escapes
5088, 2 years ago,4,"We had an Escape for a few years and it is a great car for those with a small family (whatever that might look like for you). Space in the seats and cargo area, good on gas mileage, and fairly affordable."
5089, 2 years ago,5,"Disclaimer: I had a Focus ST, not a regular Focus so this review is for the 5- speed hatchback.

This is by far the sweetest car I’ve ever driven. Tons of power in a little hatchback, lots of space, and tons of great features to make this every day driver something more than a standard grocery getter. Just do yourself a favor and get the ST3 package for all the greatness."
5090,2 years ago,5,This car is amazing!!! Very reliable amazing features sun room Bluetooth and reliable on Gas
5091, 2 years ago,5,Excelente muy comodo y facil de usar obiamente para el que sabe manejar 😅 facil para estacionar me encanto lo maneje por mi hermana y woow increible lastima que ya me compro otro mi esposo si no lo buscaria😅
5092, 2 years ago,5,"I drive the 2014 Ford Fusion and it has been the best car I ever owned. Not only is this car very comfortable for me and my passengers, it also provides a very smooth ride. The only con with this car is that it is pretty long in size and sometimes hard to fit into those small spaces on the busy city streets!"
5093, 2 years ago,5,great car great on gas and looks very nice I'm not a huge fan of Ford but I have driven this car for quite a while and I would recommend it to anybody who wants a new car. Very great on gas and has many features and gps and lots of fun stuff. And very roomy
5094, 2 years ago,5,"Love my Ford Escape. I enjoy the look of the older versions better, but the Escape works well. My gas mileage is pretty good and It can fit a lot in the car itself so it's good for moving "
5095, 2 years ago,5,"This was similar to my Escape. It was newer and had two sunroofs. I love that. Again it drove easy but have had a few problems with it, cylinders, fuses and such. Aside from that it’s good. But the dang auxiliary fuses kept going out! Ford Focus"
5096, 2 years ago,5,"This was my first car back in 2006 or something. So excited! It drove well, it wasn’t 4x4, but I took her off roading and rock climbing often. Affordable, insurance on it too. I didn’t have any cons. Drove it to California in 2008 and drove it till the wheels came off. Good times. Ford Escape"
5097,2 years ago,2,"This car is very nice but there are a lot of major downfalls for me and my family. The engine would shut off everytime you come to a stop, and there was very little space for the people in the backseat. This car isn't too expensive but you are definitely getting what you payed for."
5098,2 years ago,4,"My parents rentedthis car for vacation a few years ago. It was nice to drive through Arizona, seemed smooth and spacious."
5099, 2 years ago,5,"Growing up, my family were avid Chevy fans. After all, FORD, found. On. Road. Dead. Right??  Wrong.  I recently bought my Ford focus, and found it to be a drastic improvement over my Chevy Cobalt. I realize these are two different cars, and not all cars may follow the pattern, but for comparable small cars the Ford drives better, has more accessories, and is cheaper to repair."
5100,2 years ago,3,"Car sensors are very sensitive...small size car, drives nice, great gas saving car..."
5101, 2 years ago,5,"Smooth ride, enough room. I liked how everything was inside the car. I felt like it was meant to.ve for me."
5102,2 years ago,4,"Ford Motor Company
Ford Fiesta

Not a bad first car.
Great starter car.
Decent on gas. 

Cons? 
There is no backseat leg room. 
So even though it’s a 4 door it’s more of a 2door. 
I think most of the room ended up in the trunk tbh. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
5103, 2 years ago,3,"It was good at first , but constant problems after that . other than that it’s a good size"
5104, 2 years ago,4,One of my family memebers has one. They seem to be good on gas. Its a very nice car. The interior is very nice. I like the way it looks.
5105, 2 years ago,4,Good car but not so great on gas mileage. Fords aren't my favorite brand of vehicle but not bad. Definitely not worth the headache if you have to work on them.
5106, 2 years ago,5,Have the st and is super fast quality little car very easy to navigate.  Corners on rails and exit speed is very manageable
5107, 2 years ago,5,This is a pretty decent car I bought for my wife. She seems to love it. The kids really like it. I plan on upgrading this on to to a more if a SUV style
5108, 2 years ago,4,"I have a 2014. Gas milage is pretty good and it’s small which is great for parking in the city. I’ve had to do some repairs such as replacing leaky shocks, speakers, radio, and some other things are broken too. It is what it is"
5109, 2 years ago,5,"Great car,  affordable price,  safety features are amazing. Good has come a long way when it comes to style, safety, convenience, affordability, great car overall"
5110, 2 years ago,1,I don’t want ya back then I just want to talk about ya life day ya know what ya want to
5111, 2 years ago,1,Yes I wanna is a day or something haha was the way to you do ya want to me haha was a
5112, 2 years ago,5,"I work for a Ford dealership where I am from, I love the Ford product and enjoy working in a dealership environment. It’s not for everyone, but I love it."
5113, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford Escape, I currently have a 2017 and I used to own a 2014. I actually did prefer my 2014 in terms of how it ran but no issues with the newer one as of yet  "
5114, 2 years ago,3,"At first, we loved or fusion. But then it seemed to have a lot of recalls by Ford. It also seems to have a bad reputation for transmission issues."
5115, 2 years ago,4,I hate it . It's really small but I like their colors and it's easy to stop it because it's small. I haven't had any problem with this car
5116, 2 years ago,3,My husband drives a fusion and it's not for me. Everything about it seems cheap. He's had a few issues but nothing major.
5117,2 years ago,5,"I loveee this car so much , the gas mileage is amazing !!! It’s roomy and smooth riding and hardly have problems with it"
5118,2 years ago,3,"Too small, cute vehicle and it did have all the extra amenities but its just too small for me and my family to ride in comfort."
5119, 2 years ago,1,Literally the worst vehicle I have ever owed. The clutch in the engine is faulty and Ford is well aware yet they continue to sell tgem
5120, 2 years ago,2,This was not one of my favorites. It belonged to my sister and I found it always had some thing going wrong with it.
5121, 2 years ago,5,"Now, as much as I'm not really a fan of Fords this vehicle was super sweet inside. Leather and sleekness! Room, have I mentioned room!? It is sooo spacious! 
Enough room for everyone and if you are lucky enough to sit in the front enjoy of the fun little gadgets!"
5122,2 years ago,5,"Un carro que es sumamente elegante, a la ves es juvenil, y fresco, las veces que lo he manejado me he sentido muy cómoda en el."
5123, 2 years ago,3,"I love the car. Absolutely.  But it has a whole crapload of recalls. After I started getting them fixed, the car started acting weird. And ive since had problem after problem.  It's put me off of Ford. I will be switching back to Kia. Just for reference,  I bought my 2014 Ford fusion brand new.   Ford Motor Company"
5124, 2 years ago,5,My husband has always loved Ford vehicles. He's the one who helped me see his reasoning why. They are very dependable. They get good gas mileage. They are made in the USA. They are the only brand of vehicle that I can work on and have quite a bit of knowledge about. I don't plan on switching to another brand anytime soon. Ford Motor Company is the brand of vehicle for me.
5125, 2 years ago,5,My brother in law had a fusion. He really liked it. It seemed to ride and drive good and got good gas mileage
5126,2 years ago,4,"They styling of the car is great but they are not reliable at all. Transmisiones go out quick engines blow up over all it’s like buying a bmw, the cars are great until you hit 100k miles."
5127,2 years ago,3,It’s a great car for a teenager but the value goes drastically down. It’s a good car if you can find it will low mileage and we’ll taken care of.
5128,2 years ago,5,This is an excellent riding car. Very sporty but very comfortable also. Has all the new tech and things a teenager would want. They can be pricy at times but if you find the right one i highly recommend.
5129, 2 years ago,5,My mom had this car and she loved it. She liked the gas mileage. She also enjoyed how comfortable it was. Its a small car for me because I have 3kids but perfect for someone with a smaller family.
5130, 2 years ago,4,"Kind of small on the inside, especially in the back seat. However the seats are comfy. And the gas mileage is good too"
5131, 2 years ago,4,My fusion was a energi. I loved the mpg and it he smoothness of the ride. Mine was a fwd which made going up hills not too great which is why this review gets 4 stars. This vehicle was a lease and was amazingly reliable with no problems.
5132, 2 years ago,3,"As a passenger of Ford cars, define everyone that I have been in a small and tight fit. It offers very little comfortability especially for back row seating. Has many maintenance issues and many recalls some of these included a leaking roof. I would not recommend buying a Ford you are better to buy a import."
5133, 2 years ago,5,Had a Ford escape for a rental car while mine was getting fixed it was comfortable and drove great but was rather small
5134, 2 years ago,5,"Lovely car, this was my fist car ever and I really love it, has spacious back seats and it doesn’t consume a lot of gas, perfect for the city"
5135, 2 years ago,5,"Very nice car for a beginning driver, super safe and has awesome features! Decently cheap monthly payment as well."
5136, 2 years ago,5,"I own a 2018 Ford Escape and I love it. It drives super smooth and just feels safe on the road. I can fit 2 car seats in the back easily, with room in the middle for somebody to sit no problem. The trunk had ample space for my big double stroller and for groceries. The heated seats are a huge bonus as well. The only thing I would change is I wish there were a way to turn on the overhead light besides reaching into the backseat."
5137, 2 years ago,5,"This is exactly what I love in a car. The seats are all leather and I love the touch screen radio. Heated seats in the winter are my favorite and this gets great gas mileage. Very affordable, safe, family car!"
5138,2 years ago,4,"Loved my Ford escape had it for 15 years, replaced the transmission once after 10 years and it lasted 5 more years and went out again so I had to let it go."
5139, 2 years ago,5,The ford edge is one of the most reliable cars I've ever owned. Drives smoother than any other car I've ever been in. Little to no problems. Built to last. Love love my ford edge.
5140, 2 years ago,4,Decent car. A Ford is a Ford. It rides well. Sometimes the driver isn’t the best 🙄 besides that it’s a great small SUV. Toyota Yaris
5141, 2 years ago,5,"I recently purchased an explorer and love this car. I have never loved a more in my life! Great for kids, tons of space and decent gas mileage."
5142, 2 years ago,5,"Great gas mileage, get up and go, great size. Inwpupdnt reccomend this car for someone with car seats because the back seat is slightly small. Overall, a great car."
5143, 2 years ago,5,My Grandparents have a fusion as one of their cars and it drives so well and it’s great on gas. For a family car i’d definitely recommend this car
5144, 2 years ago,5,This was the absolute best car I’ve ever had. Never had an issue out of it and packed the miles on it very quickly. It went through a lot of wear n tear but never in the shop for anything but oil changes and tire rotations. Drove soooo smooth and easy to drive and great on gas!! Absolutely beautiful on the outside. The 2014-16 models looked best to me with the rounded fog lights like mine had. I owned the 16 model..My friend owns a fusion as well (14 model) and has about 200k miles on it and it has been very reliable to her as well.
5145,2 years ago,5,"I love this ,I had an explorer and was nervous to downsize but this car has been great for us and we do a lot of traveling so it has room for@luggage etc"
5146, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car. It’s confortable. My car is 2013 and it’s my first car. Currently, I only have changed one sensor for the motor."
5147, 2 years ago,5,I love my escape. Been cruising in tis baby for a little over 2 years. Have taken 3 long road trips (superb on gas!!). Automatic driver and Heated front seats along individual temp controller. It drives smoothly. Seriously a champ for a low eco vehicle.
5148, 2 years ago,4,Bonne conduite de voiture ou l'on ce sent en sécurité. Économique et abordable niveau tarif. Bonne voiture
5149, 2 years ago,3,This is a ok car for the price. It gets great gas mileage and doesn't cost alot to fill the tank. It doesn't have alot of leg room though so that makes it hard for tall people to be comfortable.
5150, 2 years ago,5,I just bought a 2009 Ford focus ses. I adamently hated these before actually owning one-cuz boy was I wrong. It's completely perfect and I couldn't ask for a better car!
5151, 2 years ago,1,I have owned 2 different Fords. I did not like either one of them. Both vehicles (the Escape and a Focus) had transmission issues when they were less than 4 years old. The transmission completely went out in both vehicles - the Escape was not even 2 years old when the transmission completely went out. I would never buy or recommend. 
5152, 2 years ago,4,I have a 2015 Ford Fusion and I looove it. It has everything I need and gets great gas milage. My only issue is that it’s on the wider side so sometimes parking can be hard
5153, 2 years ago,1,The Ford Escape I used was the eco boost that also could be standard transmission and I absolutely hated it. The car has a hard time accelerating and is uncomfortable.
5154, 2 years ago,5,Love everything about this car so far. I have had it for about a month now and it is a gas saver and has all the high tech fancy things for a low price!
5155, 2 years ago,5,"It's a good car for me. I dont know much about cars but I think Ford Focuz is comfortable, safe drive and looks good. Its too sensetive for me. Good price I think its affordable. I guess I recommend it."
5156,2 years ago,5,Gets me to where I need to go. It's nice on beach days or even a trip to the store.  It's not a vehicle that just breaks down its by your side at all times.
5157, 2 years ago,5,This car are very nice. I don't haved but a I think is very beautiful avanced and the wheels looks good. Inwant to Drive this car
5158, 2 years ago,3,It’s a cute car and it runs smooth but there is always a recall with car which I don’t like at all so I wouldn’t recommend this car regardless if it’s affordable.
5159,2 years ago,5,"I love my car! Although it doesnt have the need for speed its super comfortable to ride! It has a few blind spots which is easy to get used to  it rides super smooth, pretty affordable and reliable! I would have preferred to get AWD rather than front wheel drive but would highly recommend!"
5160, 2 years ago,5,Good to have to be able and have the same as you do so I don't know if it will be the healthier option but it is a good thing youre not sure what you want to be able and have to be a part time job to be able and I don't know if I can do it for the first year or two or a half a year or more of a diet and I don't want to
5161, 2 years ago,5,My husband and I have this car for a get to work car. It's small and compact and easy and smooth to drive. It's great on gas and very appealing to the eye
5162, 2 years ago,5,I love this car no problems ever great gas mileage. Tire sensors need worked on. Great colr scheme. Roomie.
5163, 2 years ago,5,"My Ford Fusion is a 2008 model. She (I call her Tina) has lasted me so long. She has over 240,000 miles and still takes me everywhere I need her to so reliably. Over the course of time, I have only had to take her into the shop about 3 times for serious things. "
5164, 2 years ago,5,"I really love my Ford Escape. It has been my favorite vehicle. It is very safe and has been really reliable! I have had many Fords and I have really liked them all, but the Escape is my favorite! I would recommend this vehicle! My Dad bought one because he like mine so much!￼"
5165, 2 years ago,4,My fiancé has a focus hatchback. The truck space is incredible and the gas mileage is beyond great. He gets close to 40+ per gallon which makes it the idea vehicle for his job. The sound system is solid and powered by Microsoft. Only complaint in the back seat is not ideal for car seats. No space. Other great car.
5166, 2 years ago,5,I have a 2014 Ford fusion titanium. I love this car love that it's awd. Great for Michigan winter. Haven't had any issues with this car either other than routine maintenance. The size is great very roomy. Giant trunk which is nice and over all not to bad on price either
5167, 2 years ago,1,This was my first big purchase and i didnt really like it. Probably the worst car ive had. It wss way too small and tye color was horrible. Im glad i moved up to chevy. It just wasnt the best car for my lifestyle. My husband barley fit in it. Never again
5168, 2 years ago,4,Compared to my Chevy Traverse I didnt like the seating. It didnt feel as roomy as my SUV. It drove good and was comfortable for this short girl.
5169, 2 years ago,4,Used this a loaner while my car was being fixed by the dealer.  It is a nice ride and gas mileage is reasonable.  It is a little too small for my likes.
5170, 2 years ago,5,"Pretty good car, excellent opción, not that expensive it absolutely deserves what you pay"
5171,2 years ago,5,"That car is my first and only car so far and I really like it , it's super comfortable."
5172, 2 years ago,5,In the past I would never have bought a Ford because my father never would have bought a Ford in the beginning then however my father change to buying forwards and has down it's the best Ford truck I've ever had its well recommended by me it is sporty and affordable I love my truck this is the first truck I've ever owned and I will buy a Ford again after this one
5173, 2 years ago,4,"My husband and I got a 2003 Ford Focus Wagon from my mom when she bought a new car. My husband uses it as a running/in town vehicle since he also has a pickup. The gas mileage is great! It's reliable, spacious, and comfortable. I hope it will last us several more years."
5174, 2 years ago,1,I hated this car!!!! it always had something wrong with it and not to mention the interior was so basic..the BEST thing about this car was the leather and sunroon
5175, 2 years ago,5,I had a Ford escape for about five years just got rid of it recently only because I needed something more new and reliable. Because I had a six cylinder it really was hard on gas and therefore I needed to find some thing a little bit more reasonable because I do drive a lot . ￼￼
5176, 2 years ago,4,My first car was a Ford focus it was given to me by my family and it was exactly what I needed to get from point a to point B it was not a 4 Wheel Dr. car which kind of in our weather conditions can be a little tricky but overall it was a great first car to have  ￼
5177,2 years ago,4,"I love my Ford escape I have the 2012 it is spacious, pretty good on gas and I think it's beautiful as well! I've had my car four years now and have yet to have a problem. It's expensive but it's worth it and I'd recommend it. Love my car it is so we'll worth it to me! It's lasted us many long vacations with both kids too! Spacious"
5178, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car. I had mine for 5 years and it was reliable. Comfortable seating for 5. This car is economical on the gas mileage, drives well on winedy roads and I know this because grimes canyon is windy. I had no problems with this car. Best car I have ever had."
5179, 2 years ago,5,"My husband has this car and it was the reason for me getting a new car. It has cup holders, 5 seating, hatchback trunk which is great for storing items. I am tall and I fit comfortable in there. I would recommend if you are looking for a small car to travel with. It’s economical and gets great gas mileage."
5180, 2 years ago,5,"My first car was a Ford Escape! I loved every minute of driving it. I felt safe and secure in it at all times. Now seeing the newer models come out it make me want to purchase another one. They are good reliable cars, not too big but still can get the job done of a mid sized vehicle."
5181, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVE MY 20219 FORD ESCAPE. The technology is so easy to use. It's comfortable, it' has great gas mileage. I use it in Michigan, and it handles the 4 seasons so well. "
5182, 2 years ago,2,I had an escape hybrid. I will never own another escape again. The brakes cost 800.00 to have done and have to be done at the dealer. I had nothing but issues with this vehichle.
5183, 2 years ago,1,I am usually not so critical of cars and SUV but I did not like this one at all.  I was not comfortable in it. It felt loud inside to me.  And I just didnt.like how it drove. Not my favorite pick. I am unsure of pricing. But i personally would not recommend
5184, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car! It fits my lifestyle so well, is good on gas and affordable. It is a great size in my opinion and has great trunk space. I will always be a Ford person because they are reliable as long as you take care of it then it will take care of you."
5185, 2 years ago,3,Okay vehicke. For my own taste it seems to be small but i feel like it a great option for the elderly population.
5186, 2 years ago,3,I have owned 2 of them and to be totally honest would never purchase again. I traded them both in for a ford f 150 and an edge and they are much better!
5187, 2 years ago,4,I got mine second hand. Had a lot of issues but it was cheep and I needed a car. I don’t know a whole lot about cars so I can’t say much on if this is good or not. Mine is also a 2003 so it’s pretty old
5188,2 years ago,4,"Cute and roomy also short people friendly.  Used this as a social worker in the field and it was very reliable.  Loved the technology as well.  It felt like an expensive car, love the animations on the dashboard"
5189, 2 years ago,5,I love my car! I have had it a while and it runs great! The only downside is that I wish it was bigger as I have a child but I did buy a smaller car. I found this car pretty affordable in comparison to other similar cars
5190, 2 years ago,3,Not the best confort wise. I don’t love American cars. Many issues from what I’ve heard . Not reliable
5191, 2 years ago,4,"I have never been a fan of Ford vehicles but we have rented brand new Fords a few times and I have to say, when they are brand new they are pretty nice. When they are loaded they feel luxurious. They have also greatly improved on the way they look - they are sharp."
5192,2 years ago,1,This car is currently back at the dealership with an engine fault. it’s a 2017... Don’t buy fords..
5193, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. It’s rides good air conditioning works great seats are comfortable. Radio works good and has a sunroof I wouldn’t want anything different it’s wasn’t that expensive. I would definitely recommend it if you want a good gas saver
5194, 2 years ago,5,"I bought my 2013 Ford Fusion in 2015. Other than the normal maintenance I have had no issues with this vehicle. The inside is large and open, great for a family vehicle, the gas mileage is great also!"
5195, 2 years ago,5,"Love our F150. The brake assist helped to stop our truck in time and we narrowly escaped death on the highway when an suv from another lane in front of us lost a tire and came flipping in front of us and into our lane. The vehicle behind us hit our tail light, but we didn't have any other damage. It could have been so much worse had we had a front impact with the suv that came flying at us on the highway. So thankful for our vehicle and I'm sure had we been driving our previous vehicle we would have suffered greatly."
5196, 2 years ago,5,The Escape handles extremely well and is able to make very tight turns for its size. Easy to maintain as well. I love the back up camera and autostart fuction on my 2018 model. The seating is comfortable too.
5197, 2 years ago,4,I absolutely love my Ford Escape! Rosie gets me everywhere and she’s very comfortable. I will be starting a family with my husband soon and it’s perfect for that! I don’t feel like it looks like a typical “mom” car but it’s still very spacious!
5198, 2 years ago,5,"I love my suv, it fits everything I need without being too big. The back truck is more than enough room for a stroller"
5199,2 years ago,3,"I love my ford KA but feel the model is far too basic. Although it is 10 years old, I am still very happy with it"
5200, 2 years ago,4,"I love this car. It’s very comfortable.
I want a car like this in my life right now, it has good spaces"
5201, 2 years ago,5,"I currently have a 99 Ford Expedition and I love that truck to the death of me. It is about 300,000 miles on it and it still runs like a dream. I would definitely not be trading my car in for anyone and I will continue to take good care of it because or is last a long time and the parts are not too expensive. So I will most definitely will be buying more."
5202, 2 years ago,4,"I love my Focus, best little car i've had to date, does everything you need for a medium sized vehicle. I got this at a great price and it had added extras - alloy wheels, Sync2 integrated system for navigation etc, sports mats and privacy glass. I have had this car for 3 years so I am due to get a new one. I am considering the new version of the Focus as I have had no issues with my current one at all!"
5203, 2 years ago,5,I love my fusion it’s pretty good on gas for the size car. It has a sporty sleek look to it. I would improve or add a blind spot sensor that beeps when someone is on your side instead of the bubble. I’d definitely recommend
5204,2 years ago,5,I LOVE FORD! My very first car was a mustang then i upgraded to  a F-150. I have never had any mechanical issues. SYNC is my favorite program. I've been in other vehicles and the system does not compare. Any time i have had any recalls they notify me and get me in and out with a rental if needed. I also love the sales team at Sewell Ford. If you not interested in ford they have many other options to your liking. I recommend 100 percent from buying a vehicle from a ford motor company.
5205, 2 years ago,3,We’ve had this car for years and have only have to fix a few things! It’s long lasting and drives smoothly
5206, 2 years ago,1,Was thinking of buying this car until I read that most fiestas started having problems and recalls for everything
5207,2 years ago,3,"I like how this car has a sleek look to it, very aerodynamic and good on gas mileage. I would prefer if the back seat had a little bit more room but other than that it’s great. I really like the details that the interior has. ￼"
5208, 2 years ago,5,I would own a mustang only because it's always been a dream for me since I was a kid to own one and I really love the looks of the car and the way the drive
5209, 2 years ago,4,"Get car for parents who love sports and their kids play, great for road trips and camping, very spacious and I love the size of the car in general"
5210, 2 years ago,5,"I love my Ford Focus, it's a good little everyday car that gets me from point a to point b. It has a 2.3 ltr so it has a little extra power to it which i like. So far it's been a very reliable vehicle."
5211,2 years ago,4,Very comfortable vehicle to drive and has a nice features! I had this as a company car and could honestly say I enjoyed it.
5212,2 years ago,1,"This car is a good size for a young or small person who doesn't have the need to carry more than one passenger often or for long periods of time. This car is plagued with the CVT engine that has required numerous changes and was part of a Class Action Lawsuit. The gas mileage was decent as was its handling. If they can figure out how to make them without requiring so many parts replacements, then the vehicle would be a great first car or downsize for an older person."
5213,2 years ago,4,"I have owned many generations of the Ford Focus, from the sedan to the hatchback coupe. They are very sporty feeling drives, so long as you don't get the SE base. The base model lacks and pick up or power and will make the driver hesitant to make left turns. However, the models up from that give a nice ride and can overtake cars on the highway with ease. The seats in them are super supportive of my frame and the sides hug me during corners so I feel secure. It is a shame that the newer models suffered recalls and issues with the CVT engines."
5214, 2 years ago,4,This is a good car for someone who wants a mid sized SUV but wants good gas milage.  The tank on this is good and it doesnt cost a lot to fill.  It runs well and has good features. I think all models should come AWD but they don't. The newer ones have better insides and features.
5215, 2 years ago,5,Love my Ford escape! Has a great internal set up and dash controls! Love the touch screen piece in the middle dash and how easy it is to use! It is an affordable and dependable vehicle! I would recommend!
5216,2 years ago,5,The newer escapes are extremely nice. Perfect for a single family or small family. Lots of upgrades.
5217, 2 years ago,5,Very nice but not  for me I like my escape.. just the right size for me and the way I enjoy to drive. My passages are comfortable in the back. Plus I feel safe driving in the car in all kinds of weather which I have.  The has  never let me down and is a good feeling. A dependable car.
5218, 2 years ago,5,"I loved this from day one.  Just a four cylinder perfect for me, got it used. Never looked back but would love a new one."
5219, 2 years ago,5,I loved this car! It is so spacious and reliable! I drive it for about 2-3 years with no issues!
5220, 2 years ago,5,"Ford Explorer, I owner of this truck I feel safe in street and anywhere. I can shopping anything cause I have the space for carry home 🏡. All seat 💺 is versatile and I can move to the front and the floor stay flat for better spaces and comfort. Because every mom need have safe 🚙 and spaces. 😍"
5221, 2 years ago,4,I love my vehicle. I'm blessed to say that I have little to no work that needs done on my vehicle. I've had my Ford for almost 3 years. I'm looking to upgrade it soon for a newer model.
5222, 2 years ago,5,"I give it a very good review, because I like the product, I am an active consumer and all I recommend is because it really is of the best quality"
5223, 2 years ago,3,Great little card for commuting as it’s good on fuel. Backseat is more for decoration than use. Anyone with height won’t get their legs in comfortably.
5224, 2 years ago,2,"When purchased we chose fully loaded. The leather seats stayed looking new the whole time, never fades or cracked. The rest of the interior slowly was coming apart such as, the door trim, the plastic around shifter. The mechanics were working great until one day after Ford fixing a recall on the air bag, the engine had issues with the piston rod. Other then that, it was great of gas and for long travel times. Fit 3 kids, 2 car seats, in the back comfortably. Great family vehicle just not as good as full experience as thought/wanted to happen. "
5225, 2 years ago,5,"I've been a passenger in a Fusion several times. My mum has one. Smooth ride, but it yells at me when I don't put on my seat belt as a passenger ;) seems to be a smooth ride, and she said she got a great deal on it and loves the thing so I suppose that's what matters!"
5226, 2 years ago,5,"You can never go wrong with a FORD!! my pick up had never given me a problems! My Ford runs great! It's the best of the best by far. Great for travel and everyday use. 
Very reliable!"
5227, 2 years ago,5,My dad drives his car. It is a very reliable and comfortable car. Would buy it for myself in the future.￼
5228,2 years ago,5,Our Ford Focus gets really good gas mileage and is very reliable. It is also small and very comfortable to drive. The only bad thing is that there is not a lot of room in the trunk.                           Ford Focus
5229, 2 years ago,5,Comfy. Powerful with the 2.0 EcoBoost. It has tons of features. I'm over 100k miles and haven't had one issue. It is good looking.
5230, 2 years ago,5,"I have always loved a focus. Roomy, good gas mileage, and they can scoot too. Never owed  one but had the privilege of driving a friends and I loved it."
5231, 2 years ago,4,"Personally I don’t like driving small cars, but this was a smooth drive and I didn’t hate driving it! Not my favorite car I’ve driven but it is still very nice."
5232,2 years ago,5,"I drive an explorer and the gas isn't great but I love my car, my friends say it is luxurious inside with the all black and grey leather interior. I love folding the back row down and having a full truck bed to load up with just about anything, it is big enough to sleep back there on a road trip"
5233, 2 years ago,2,Pros great gas mileage and doesn't cost to much to fill. Cons to low to the ground not very roomy a lot smaller then it looks otherwise
5234, 2 years ago,2,"Uncomfortable to ride long distances in, I hate the smallness or it. Little storage space for groceries. Does get good gas mileage so that is the only plus to it. I would not purchase it. "
5235, 2 years ago,3,Decent vehicle. Always seemed to have an issue no matter what you would do. Engine started going out and it was going to be cheaper to buy a car than replace it. Ford's aren't my go to vehicle for anything.
5236, 2 years ago,5,"I bought a 2012 Ford Escape in April 2019. It had 91,000 miles on it and I got a great deal! It now has 158,000 miles! I have only had a couple of minor problems with it. Mainly just things you would expect from an older car! It drives great! Gets good gas mileage! Enough room for my 2 boys in the back seat! And in snow it is awesome! I never worry about driving in snow because it goes so well! When time to purchase a new car, the Ford Escape will be my first stop!"
5237, 2 years ago,5,I think it's a really great car with great gas mileage. It's been a huge blessing to me.
5238, 2 years ago,5,"Learnt to drive in this car!
Fab car to drive, really spacious and comfy to drive. 
It’s a really good and reliable car to own."
5239, 2 years ago,3,Great car that gets you from point a to point b. The hatchback is a great feature for stowing anything (surfboard included)
5240, 2 years ago,4,I had a hatchback version of this for a rental care and I loved the open space but yet theres a separate trunk area. It rode pretty smooth. I think it would be important put the right tires on because the suspension seemed tight.
5241, 2 years ago,5,I have it before and it pretty  good. But because  I really need something  to personal  I sell it. And I'm happy the person  who buy it is taking care of it and now he still  using it  and said he love it than his vehicle  before..
5242, 2 years ago,5,I been driving this for long time  like 9 yrs .so far still good and helps me alot.. its running good and I don't have any problem on it.
5243, 2 years ago,5,"I have a hybrid and in absolute love with this vehicle. We are seeing 30 - 31 mpg, and so thrilled about that.Pros - EverythingCons - In my opinion.... None"
5244, 2 years ago,5,"I absolutely love my fusion. I have a 2015, and I have never had any real issues with it. I got my car in 2016 and I’ve only had 2 recalls (which is no big deal in my opinion). The car is more of a family car but definitely can have a little speed if you want it!"
5245, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car, so cute and a nice small SUV that looks very sleek and pretty. Gas mileage could be better, but I have a 2013. Great touchscreen, gps and Bluetooth feautures"
5246, 2 years ago,5,Was a great car while I had it! So much space and drove so smoothly. I loved the back up camera never had any issues!
5247, 2 years ago,2,I don’t like the way it drives. It has the feeling that it’s switching gears when you press on its breaks
5248,2 years ago,5,Ford fusions are such nice cars. They ride really smooth while also being pretty quiet. They have all the latest technology in the newer ones like heated steering wheel with the heated seats. This car is probably around the middle with its price point but it is definitely worth it.
5249, 2 years ago,3,Ok. It’s  good American car. Semi sporty. Affordable. Gets good gas mileage. Good color choices
5250, 2 years ago,5,"This is a very nice car. I've only have rode inside of it but the interior is very nice, has a back up camera and a touch screen so you can change music and stuff you can also connect your phone to it by Bluetooth. The outside is very nice too"
5251, 2 years ago,1,This car is terrible. The power shift transmission in them are garbage and ford just tells you crap to get you in and out of the door without really fixing the problem
5252, 2 years ago,5,Compact suv. Cute affordable. Available on a hybrid. 4x4 or AWD. Great colors available
5253, 2 years ago,5,Comfortable good looking low profile vehicle. Also comes in a hybrid. Ford Sync is excellent
5254, 2 years ago,5,"I love my fusion. It rides so smoothly and is extremely roomy. I definitely would buy another. My only gripe would have to be it doesn't get the best gas mileage, but it could be worse."
5255, 2 years ago,4,Bought new. I’m not picky about features and things. Great vehicle. Hasn’t given me an issue yet
5256, 2 years ago,5,Fords will always hold a special place in my heart. My dad drives a fusion and this is the car I learned to drive it. 155k miles with mechanical or electronic issues at all. Amazing car brand and quality.
5257, 2 years ago,4,Chill little car its got a lot of leg room for a little vehicle. Doesn't have much pep in its step when accelerating from a dead stop but once your moving it goes pretty fast. I love the gas millage on this one too! But it isn't an AWD
5258, 2 years ago,3,"I have a 2011 Ford Escape. An escape was my first car (2008) so I was very excited when I got my 2011 a few years back. The car is definitely reliable, comfortable, smooth driving. I love it however it is a gas guzzler. Most likely will go with something more eco friendly and gas efficient when I get a new car."
5259, 2 years ago,5,This is a great mommy car. I had so much room inside and the handling was so smooth. The inside is cute and teched out. There was even a light in the back under the front armrest that I kept changing colors. The chairs are pretty comfortable and seat warmers were so convenient especially during the colder days.
5260, 2 years ago,3,My mom has had one for years and has spent thousands of dollars on repairs. She has to replace the transmission. She has had major work done on the motor several times. I dont know what she paid for her ford. I wouldn't recommend her year but the newer ones look nice and may be better quality.
5261,2 years ago,5,My first car was a fiesta and loved it. It was a limited edition one and it was the cutest
5262, 2 years ago,5,Love my 2011 Ford Fusion. Its reliable and smooth.  Very spacious and comfortable. I hope to have this car for many more years.
5263, 2 years ago,5,Great company to purchase a vehicle from. My boyfriend had a ford f 150 and he lives it. Great truck to haul materials around in for his job and they are ford tough.
5264, 2 years ago,2,I bought an older focus when I was younger. I got into an accident we’re someone hit my door.. the door was dented and it was a complete loss just from that. Seems pretty cheaply made in my opinion.
5265, 2 years ago,3,I bought a Ford Fusion that was a 2006 years ago. It lasted pretty well but also ended up having issues with the transmission. After coming out of shopping at Walmart my car didn’t start. It had issues ever since! Had to get a new car!
5266, 2 years ago,2,A robust little car. Definitely not something flashy or high end but got me from A to B with little to no problems. Could definitely do with updating things with the times but a good first car. 
5267, 2 years ago,5,"Great ride Love the look too Like the saying goes, ‘built Ford tough’ Handles Great in all weather"
5268, 2 years ago,3,Decent sized car for our needs. Easy to road trip in and the truck easily fits a hockey bag and sticks. Comfortable seats
5269, 2 years ago,3,Nice looking car with a lot of space. We had a 2016 Ford Fusion . But we had to get rid of it since it used up a lot of gas . It was pretty affordable for the size of the car. I would recommend if gas mileage isn’t important to you.
5270, 2 years ago,5,"I owned a used 2014 Ford Fiesta for a few years while commuting. It was incredibly reliable and had great gas mileage. It was a tiny hatchback so not great for long rides but it was perfect for just me. It got nearly 90,000 miles on it before I sold it and it was still in great shape!"
5271, 2 years ago,4,My husband bought a 2012 Fusion while we were dating and it’s our main car. We don’t need anything crazy since we live in a city and walk to work. Gets great gas mileage and is relatively comfortable on long car rides.
5272, 2 years ago,3,"It’s TINY on the inside and out. Being small on the outside isn’t a total loss, much easier to park in tighter spaces and get around traffic. The inside is super tiny, my husbands knees touch the dash no matter how far back his seat goes, and then we lose space for the car seat."
5273, 2 years ago,5,"I purchased my 2011 Ford Fiesta 4-dr Sedan brand new for a reasonable $16k. I was attracted by the low price tag and great gas mileage. Despite its small profile, the interior is quite roomy with an extremely large trunk which is accessible from the inside by folding down either side of the back seat. It seats five adults adequately and the backseat is large enough for three kids with car seats. I prefer a manual transmission which compensates for any loss of performance from the 4 cylinder engine by giving me control of speed while running through gears. It's sleek and innovative body style keeps it looking relevant and modern. I purchased a base model to insure fewer repairs and low maintenance costs and I haven't been disappointed. Oil changes, tires, brakes, and wiper blades are the only things I've had done. The vacuum sealed gas tank doesnt require a cap, so I've never had to replace one of those. I've used it to move coast to coast and back and driven as fas as Texas from California, with no problems. You cannot tow with this vehicle, but with an additional soft roof carrier and the large trunk space, I have been,able to carry quite a bit with it. Overall, I love this car and it has remained dependable for the 9 years which I have owned it."
5274, 2 years ago,5,Very nice and small car but it gets you from point A to B. Love the interior !!!!!!!!!!
5275, 2 years ago,5,"I grew up in a Ford family, working on cars and trucks and they've never let me down. Granted, they don't make 'em like they used to, but jo one does anymore. The only thing I'll ever own is a Ford."
5276, 2 years ago,4,"My husband has an 05 Ford F150 SuperCrew 4 door pickup truck. We paid quite a bit of money for it and it was a used truck several years ago. It has cloth seating, power doors and windows and a backup sensor. We found that the back seat has more room than some of the other models that Ford makes. The front seat are dual seats and very roomy. There are a few negative issues with owning this Ford pickup truck. Ford motor company has installed so many sensors in and around this pickup truck that if one goes bad sometimes it shuts the whole vehicle down and it's inoperable till it's fixed. We have had to invest quite a bit of money into this truck but we still love it and drive it every single day. I am a ghoul who grew up around Fords all of my family would only buy and drive a Ford."
5277, 2 years ago,5,"Loooooovvvvveeeee my little Sapphire(my cars name) shes small, good on gas and keeps me moving.  I love opening the sunroof on sunny days to get a good dose of vitamin d."
5278, 2 years ago,4,It’s roomy and super tech savvy which is nice. I’m not a huge fan of ford but it was a good rental when I used it.
5279, 2 years ago,4,"Nice features, cute, zippy. I'm 5ft 2in and it is easy for me to drive and my hubs is 5ft 10in and it's easy for him to drive. Plus it has a large trunk."
5280, 2 years ago,5,"It is very small and I love that, because use very little gasoline and it is very practical. I definitely love this car."
5281, 2 years ago,4,Friends have had this car and it’s a good car comfortable seats and lots of room for a sedan
5282, 2 years ago,1,This car is an utter piece of crap. It constantly has recalls. Ford refuses to fix it... and not only that their solution is to constantly reprogram the transmission
5283, 2 years ago,5,"Another great car, efficient on fuel especially when doing long journeys, while design of the product is great."
5284, 2 years ago,5,"Defiantly the best car I’ve had so far, beautiful designs, speed is a must, always gotta get the places fast😌 
Comfortable seats inside, smooth finish when looking at the car all together"
5285, 2 years ago,4,"It was a great compact suv for our small family, it got good gas mileage for a AWD and it was always reliable"
5286, 2 years ago,4,This is a decent sized small suv. The 4WD is great. The ride isn't as smooth as some others. It rides more like a truck.
5287, 2 years ago,5,I love my car. I’ve had it for 5yrs and no complaints at all. A pleasure to drive. It’s taken care of me all these years. I’ve never experienced any problems with it
5288, 2 years ago,5,It is my first car! I’ve had for about 5 months now and I absolutely love it. The heated seats is probably my favorite part of the bells and whistles but it’s a great Gas saver
5289,2 years ago,3,"The Ford I owned made me miserable. I had it for two years before I replaced it. It had issues starting, especially when it had rained. I personally would not buy another Ford, but I have had others who love theirs."
5290, 2 years ago,4,"I love my car, it’s just a little more cramped then the usual cars I’ve had. The trunk space isn’t very spacious. There isn’t a lot of compartments to put anything in."
5291, 2 years ago,3,"I love this car i have a Hatchback version. I wish the back seats had more room. I've  got a pretty big family as in big people, they fit as well as i would have liked. But the car is very good! i would recommend. i haven't had to many problems with it either, the gas tank is small as is most small vehicles  but you have to fill up a lot but its not much to fill it up!"
5292,2 years ago,4,Cute little car that's perfect for a first car as isn't too powerful so isn't going to cost the world to be insured on as a first time driver. Can fit in the back easily and sufficient boot room for basic stuff. Wouldn't be able to fit luggage in easily
5293,2 years ago,5,"Super comfy to drive, be a passenger in the front as well as being a passenger in the back. Boot is surprisingly large and can fit a lot of my rubbish in. Car is speedier than you'd initially think and I highly recommend for use on short journeys as well as long journeys!"
5294, 2 years ago,5,Ive had my ford fusion for 5 years and absolutely love it! With bluetooth I can make calls without compromising my driving since I keep both my hands on the wheel. It is gas saver so thats a plus. Im a big Ford fan so I'll stay in the fam if I decide I need a family vehicle. Highly recommend!
5295, 2 years ago,3,"My best friend has had a Ford Focus forever. It’s one tough car but it is terrible in the snow! It’s lasted her plenty of years, but that thing gets stuck in an inch of snow. Do not recommend for places with heavy snowfall."
5296, 2 years ago,5,"Best American brand cars, my grandfather's Ford truck has been to hell and back, and it still runs perfect there has never been any problems with it at all. The truck itself was the standard work truck model. We used it up in the mountains and on a ranch and its survived major accidents without a scratch."
5297, 2 years ago,4,"Is a cheap car that car make you feel safe!
Is not gonna give you any headaches! Could be a little bit more powerful! But overall space to put your glass is great should come with sunroof just saying 😝"
5298, 2 years ago,5,"Great gas mileage, I drove an AWD and I was pushing through the Michigan snow with all the other trucks!  I would recommend this as the perfect starter vehicle for any beginning driver to the elderly!"
5299, 2 years ago,5,This is my first car and it’s great. I love the way it drives. Very affordable car payment.
5300,2 years ago,5,Love this little car very sporty great on gas and very roomie for a small car. Highly reccomend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced vehicle.
5301,2 years ago,5,This car is awesome I love the gas mileage it gets and how smooth it drives it's a great car for a small family and has lots of space in the back for trips or just to go shopping. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a safe vehicle.
5302, 2 years ago,5,Test drove one. Very nice and amazing features! Will definitely consider for my next purchase! I love how high tech this vehicle is. The one I drove was fully loaded even with a backup camera!
5303, 2 years ago,5,Ford is iconic American. They are dependable and will last   a long time with regular maintenance. I have had mine for years and it runs like a dream.
5304, 2 years ago,5,I have had this car for about 2.5 years and absolutely love it. I have had no major issues and I commute 350-400 miles a week. Very reliable and excellent gas mileage
5305, 2 years ago,2,Nope. That's all I can say. This car fell out of a cracker Jack box. The seats are awful. It has awful gas mileage for as small as the car is. The technology is basic. It's a very basic car that will leave you with back pain if you go on a trip.
5306, 2 years ago,4,These have a very spacious seating area however there isn't a lot of storage space. It has a nice ride but it doesn't cancel noise out very well so you hear a lot of the wind and road noise. These are quite spendy for the product compared to comparable vehicles.
5307, 2 years ago,5,My husbands car.  Has had since 2009.  He loves Ford.  Has held up well & reliable through the years
5308, 2 years ago,5,"I would say this has been a good car for the past year. We did have to do some minor work to it, but nothing beyond the normal maintenance that you would have to do to a car."
5309, 2 years ago,4,"Nice economy car. Runs great, has good cab space, large trunk, and easy to drive/handle. Low to the ground, and not a lot of headspace for the taller people in your life."
5310, 2 years ago,4,"The most reliable vehicle I’ve owned. I know these models tend to have transmission issues, which luckily we haven’t dealt with. However, we do have some sort of (i think) wiring issues with our radio/speakers. So we’re driving around sadly with no tunes. Overall, decent daily driver"
5311, 2 years ago,5,Great car .Saves a lot of gas and you get the great mileage.Ive been driving ford for years and currently looking into buying a new ford edge.
5312, 2 years ago,4,I really like my Ford Escape!  It has enough room for passengers and luggage or all my shopping. It isnt the best on gas but that's okay. I might go for one of the bigger models next but love my escape
5313, 2 years ago,5,"Had a 2011 Ford Escape for many years. It was a great size, huge trunk, and smooth rude. Nice leather seats, large dash, and has FordSync as well. I loved the size, just wish it got better gas mileage."
5314, 2 years ago,3,"My husband used to drive a Ford and it was an okay car.  It looked nice and didn't have too many issues.  But the issues it did have were pretty extreme.  I would consider a truck by Ford in the future if the price was right, but overall it is a make I would avoid."
5315, 2 years ago,4,I love my car . I do have cloth seats which are harder to clean but the drive is pretty smooth and not much extra work to put into it.
5316, 2 years ago,5,"This is one of the easiest cars I have driven. Very nice with a lot of room has a lot of different things my other cars did not have. Back up camera heated seats, big nice radio. Very happy with my purchase."
5317, 2 years ago,5,"I love this car. It runs so smoothly, you barely feel the sound outaide, it's comfortable, the sound and air is perfect, and you yave a lot of soace on the trunk and for your sitting. I really love this car for the city or travelling, it's amazing."
5318,2 years ago,4,"very first car, had the 05 escape, rusty and old but she got me to a-b, not very fast but she was okay while she lasted"
5319, 2 years ago,5,"Best company to get a car from, the most reliable and cost friendly parts and best customer service, barra is life"
5320, 2 years ago,4,"No complaints so far, the explorer is my first ford and first american made car.  Has tons of room in it, comfortable for long drives. I would prefer it be hybrid gas/electric standard."
5321, 2 years ago,5,Very nice car for a family ride or if you just like a lot of space to go shopping like me hahaha. Absolutely adorable car not too big not too small just the right size for me. Very affordable as opposed to similar cars from the competitors. I would definitely recommend
5322, 2 years ago,5,"I owned a Ford Escape and I live in an are of the country that gets over 13 feet of snow per year. I have never gotten stuck or slid off the icy roads once. It held up to years of salt and sand on roads. 
I think that the Escape is a good investment and is worth every penny."
5323, 2 years ago,2,"My Ford had so many problems. Oil leaks, bad heater core, bad cooling and heating system, bad radiator... I take care of my cars like a baby but I just had way too many problems. I paid for what I got.. very inexpensive. Would not recommend this brand... Spent more money fixing it than I did on the purchase."
5324, 2 years ago,4,Old versions I'm not a fan of. Newer are better. I personally dont own but have driven many times and they are nice and smooth and great on gas!
5325, 2 years ago,4,I loved this car but not enough to buy.  The console is user friendly and comfortable for the driver.   I also love that they have a semi electric option.  That helped us save on gas immensely.
5326, 2 years ago,5,"I dont know which model my boyfriend has, BUT this baby has seat warmers and my life changed after that, its so rare to find a car with that, but everytime we are in a road trip and my back hurts(thanks scoliosis) I get so relaxed thans to the seat!"
5327,2 years ago,5,"I haven't owned one myself but have been a passenger. The ride was smooth, comfortable, and there was plenty of space. I'd definitely recommend this vehicle to someone looking to buy a Ford, especially if you need something with a little more space but don't want an SUV."
5328, 2 years ago,5,"I LOVEEEEEEEE mi car, it’s so good on gas and it drives really well. The ford that I went to was amazing as well"
5329, 2 years ago,3,"Perfect for a busy family. Can be too much space if you don’t need it. Mileage is okay, but it’s perfect for a soccer mom. Decently priced."
5330, 2 years ago,3,"Since it’s a 2007 model, mine is a bit older so it’s not as nice, but it sure does get the job done!"
5331, 2 years ago,5,I just recently got this car in the titanium model! I absolutely love the amount of space this car has! I think it has the greatest bang for your buck!! All of the features are super amazing?!! It’s a nice affordable suv! Highly recommend!!!!
5332, 2 years ago,5,I love my car! It has room to haul everything I need without feeling clunky. I get lots of compliments on my vehicle and hope to drive it for years to come. Gas and maintenance on my vehicle are affordable. This is the second Escape I have owned.
5333, 2 years ago,5,"I love my ford, I own a truck and they are so smooth and no complaints, my truck is 21 years old"
5334, 2 years ago,4,Everyone loves a Ford car. They are such a smooth ride and there is so much room in the car.
5335, 2 years ago,5,"I love my car so much. I have had it for seven years now. It runs so well and has never given me any issues. It is beautiful, roomy, and great on gas mileage. Ford cars are the best!!"
5336, 2 years ago,4,"Great product. Beautiful interior. Runs smooth. Really good on gas. Beautifully designed. A little small. Increase the size of the car a little bit. Affordable, not to pricey. Definently a good car for older folks or high school or college students."
5337, 2 years ago,4,"I love my expedition. She is a gas guzzler but I have a large family and am not the minivan type. Reliable, trustworthy and has the power of a truck"
5338, 2 years ago,4,"This great little car was my first vehicle.  It got the job done and for greater gas mileage.  On the highway one day, I was sideswiped by a Volvo that careened to avoid drag racers on a major highway. When I saw the Volvo coming in my Fiesta I thought, ""I'm done.""  The Volvo door and side was heavily damaged; the Fiesta, lightly scraped.  I was grateful for the solidity of this little vehicle and highly recommend it for city travel and as an inexpensive car."
5339,2 years ago,4,My mother in law just purchased the 2019 Ford Escape and it is an awesome little SUV. I love all of the features. It is a comfortable ride as well!
5340, 2 years ago,5,My first car was a 2011 ford escape. I absolutely loved it. I had so much space for practically anything and everything I needed it for . 
5341, 2 years ago,5,Purchased for my son and I'm jealous of the gas mileage he gets I think he said he gets close to 40mpg.Cute car sporty and he loves it.
5342, 2 years ago,5,Great car. Super easy to drive and to park. The gas mileage is good and it's pretty affordable which is nice! 
5343, 2 years ago,4,This is a good starter car for a college student or high school student to start out with.
5344, 2 years ago,4,"This is an affordable, good first car to start off with for a college student or something."
5345, 2 years ago,5,"Is a simple, very simple car. Super cheap price for a first car is ok. The good thing is you can make 36 miles with one gallon! Just amazing! Super economic! Good for travel, and plus good space for bagagem. Ford Fiesta 🤙🏻🚙"
5346, 2 years ago,4,Good on gas and spacious enough to haul stuff. I don’t like that there aren’t any rear vents for the ac/heater. Love the moonroof on sunny day!
5347, 2 years ago,4,"These are pretty nice cars for a 4 cylinder hatch back. It got good gas mileage and was a smooth riding car. Surprisingly, for a compact car, it had quite a bit of room inside."
5348, 2 years ago,4,"The car was a good car to use as a family starting a new life and figuring out what to do with our lives. But it was the back in 2005, it was a small car but good enough. I’m sure they have made major improvements."
5349, 2 years ago,3,We bought our 2010 fusion about 4 months after we got married. It’s been on at least 3 cross country trips in the 4 years we’ve owned it and it’s done well. My biggest complaint is seeing out the back and my blind spots really suck.
