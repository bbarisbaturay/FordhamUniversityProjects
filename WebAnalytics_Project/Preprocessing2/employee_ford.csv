Health care slowly being taken away. retirement may not be pssable in just a few years. Management has begun taking out there anger on the hourly work force. Talking between the hourly work force and mangement has stopped. Ideas that might save money or the company are not taken to the upper management or are changed to make them seem like bad ideas. Cost cutting programs are started even when it costs more money then the old way. Safty at some buildings for hour work force has been ignored. Some managements ideas on safty are simple as this statement ""We might if the problem if some one get hurt."""

2008-06-12,4.0,"Ford needs to act like a smaller company, not just be one. Ford is a great place to work for good worklife balance.  There is also a high level of diversity amongst employees, and people from all different cultures work here.  Most people are friendly and welcoming.  Everyone makes you feel like you're welcome and wanted, even if its fake at times.There's way too much red tape in the process.  The company is full of bureaucracy.  The worst problem is that higher management does not know what it is doing.  Every 12 years, there tends to be a new mantra for higher management.  Everyone moves in that direction, then two years later, its gone  discarded  kaput!  Then, a new manager comes in; with a new mantra.  There's a lot of ""waste"" (i.e. TPS muda) in every process."
2008-06-12,4.0,"How an hourly Ford worker see the company The pay and benefits, even though they are shinking, are still the best around.   Ford also provides a great opportunity to work in a diverse work environment.  The concept of working as a team is also stressed to the the continuous build process.  If the first person does the job wrong, the next will have problems.Some of the downsides are that performance has little effect on the way you are viewed and advanced.  Senority is key.  The work on the body is strenuous and wears it down.  Employees are also given too many opportunities to keep their jobs.  The company and union need to work together to keep the strongest work force, not just a high number of employees."
2008-06-12,4.0,"Good company to work for when the auto industry is doing well There are a lot of opportunities to expand you knowledge to different areas of the business.  Work/life balance is the best of any company I have worked for.  The benefits used to be top notch, but have been reduced in recent years.  Still better than most other companies.Poor senior management communication.  Ford needs to change with the times and it is business as usual from decades past. The constant turmoil of the automotive industry puts a lot of strain on the employees."
2008-06-12,4.0,"An executive with high integrity who is perceived as being honest in communications Employees passionate for the auto business.  There is a new focus on accountability in the Company with and honest recognition that the old ways of doing business will not win the war.  The Company appears to be less wed to the historical Ford legacy which is slower to evolve and address the changing industry.  Over time, Ford will become less of a family legacy business, to a results driven business that doesn't mute strong leadership and drives differentiation from the competitors.  Product design is starting to take a stronger role in the Company, but still a long way from being an industry leader.Too much ""Detroit think"".  Difficult to attract up and coming mid level talent during a time when the industry is in such turmoil."
2008-06-12,3.0,"The jury is still out Great products and very good people to work with.  Ford hires strong people, who have a passion for the automotive industry.Ford needs to get out of the continuous downsize mode.  The product plan has been tilted toward trucks and SUV's, and there has been a market shift toward cars.  Also, Ford needs to act as a more global company, and take advantage of great products that we make around the world."
2008-06-13,4.0,"good review I like the working atmosphere here at Ford Motor Co including telecomutting, paid vacations, etc. I could have possibly well balance my life between my family and my career.Ford Motor Co's business is not diversified and therefore it's going through tough time aligning it's business which is only in auto manufacturing. I feel if  it had had well diversified it's business like GE, it wouldn't had to face this time lime especially during this economic down turn."
2008-06-13,2.0,"Things will get better but need to wait another 2-3 years...if you can.... Mgmt want to help salaried work force have a good worklife balance.  Optomistic about the future but things are very dififcult now.  Promotions are very difficlut to come by.  Overall good comapny that will make it through this difficutt period, just need to wait it out if you can.Pay and benefits are being reduced, unfair business environment relative to competition due to regulatory issues.  Need government support as other companies have to get competitive advantage back.  More work with less people."

2008-06-15,3.0,"No surprises at Ford... a big company trying to do well. Has a great reputation within the finance realm.  Most employees generally try to do the right thing and want the company to do well ... very supportive of coworkers and willing to help/offer ideas.  Definitely not a cutthroat environment.Very little control over where you work and what you are doing.  Opportunities for advancement occur behind closed doors without open communication.  Inefficient systems and processes balloon in size while number of employees and staffed functions dwindle.  Typical older, larger company issues ... lots of history (has always been done this way) with marked differences in perspective.  Company does not value any work experience gained outside of Ford (i.e.: 10+ years external experience with MBA on same level as entry level BBA with no work experience since same time at Ford is put in).  Too much manual, mindnumbing work and reliance on Excel."
2008-06-16,5.0,"Live the future today. Best place to learn how big companies are changing to survive the challenges of globalization. Good people who are tough, supportive and eager to see their company survive the global auto wars, on top.Culture is a complex mix of fear, pride and insider dealings. Attempts to build trust are just that, the old axiom of actions speak louder than words would apply."
2008-06-23,4.0,From inside a company going through hard times It is a company with a big history. Everybody knows and talks about Ford Motor Company and its performance. It is interesting to have an inside point of view and specially to work with the company in its efforts to become profitable once againSometimes people is not very optimistic about the company perfomance and that can be frustrating
2008-06-25,1.0,"Ford, not a bad place to start There is a reasonably high level of job security, and if you desire to live in Detroit then it's the best place to be.  Internal information systems are good for performing your actual job.  It's not a bad place to start a career.Current state of the economy and of US Automotive in general ensures that there will forever be ""head count"" reductions and cost reductions...translation small bonuses and an ever decreasing pool of management positions.  There is still a very strong ""old boys"" club which makes it difficult to advance."
2008-06-30,3.0,"There is still a chance for Ford to turn the corner. The people make it a great place to work.(1) There are too many ""yesmen"", (2) there is still a mindset for ""empire building"" among upper management, (3) individual performance is still valued more than team performance (e.g. the key performance of a ""role"" player), (4) the mindset of ""what can I do"" to make my coworker succeed is absent"

2008-07-12,4.0,"The future is looking quite good. Ford Motor Company is one of the largest manufacturing firms in the world and is #7 on the FORTUNE 500 list for 2008. Just a few years ago, it was madly profitable and the owner of such renowned brands as Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Hertz. Sadly, those days are over, the stock price has plummeted from its peak, and thousands of white and blue collar workers have been laid off.However, while the North American segment has suffered, Ford is experiencing tremendous success in South America, Europe, Russia, and Asia and the mass exodus of management talent appears to have stopped since Alan Mullaly came over from Boeing. Although the company appears to be in terrible shape at the moment, there is great promise ahead. With the transition to global vehicle platforms in the near future, new vehicles will look and feel the same across all continents eliminating the constant yearning in the US for the European variants of the Fiesta, Focus, and Mondeo cars.In addition to their Escape and Mariner hybrid SUVs, Ford is bringing to market new Fusion and Milan hybrid sedans in 2009 and will start selling brand new Fiesta and Focus small cars (on the global platform) in 2010. With the new Flex, MKT, F150, F100, Mustang, and Taurus appearing soon, the product mix will certainly become more diversified and much more competitive.Fuel prices are killing the auto industry at this time, but Ford has chosen to invest in proven technologies like 6speed automatic transmissions, electric power steering, better aerodynamics, lighter materials, etc. that not only improve fuel economy, but keep the cost of the vehicle reasonable.Mulally has made some difficult decisions, but if Ford can weather the storm these next few years, they will come out stronger, leaner, and better than ever. So although the current climate may be glum, they are poised for sure success in the next decade.With very little capital sitting around to spend on refurbishing office spaces, buying new printers and more powerful computers, providing office phones and cell phones to the workers, and other such niceties most employees expect to enjoy, the office environment, at least where I work, is nothing special and actually quite outdated.There is very little budgeted for travel expenses, so in times past, when engineers needed to head to another factory for a couple of days, they are now confined to Southeast Michigan and teleconferencing. The money is also especially tight when it comes to computer upgrades, getting office phones installed, or getting a work cell phone. For new workers, it's basically impossible.In the past two years, more than 30% of the white collar work force has been cut, so this naturally leads to diminishing morale and more work for the lucky ones who are left. As well, the parking lots and office areas are a bit more empty, too.For those predisposed to dislike hierarchical management structures, staying away from Ford would be a must. There are layers upon layers of supervisors and managers stuffed between Mulally at the top and the entrylevel engineer at the bottom. Starting from my position on the bottom rung, there is a section supervisor, an area supervisor, the executive engineer for Automatic Transmission Operations, the North American Director of Powertrain Operations, the Group Vice President of Manufacturing, and then the big cheese, CEO Alan Mulally who technically reports to Executive Chairman Bill Ford, Jr."
2008-07-14,4.0,"Family owned, tries hard, but still has a long way to go Overall, Ford still believes in it's people and to a certain extent, the extended ford ""family"". It tries it's best to put people's work first, offering good benefits, some tuition assistance programs, flexible schedules/work days (4 day/10 hour) despite economic hardship in the industry. Some of these programs have probably been axed due to budget cuts, but even despite it's size, the management is still family operated.Unfortunately, the industry is just not a growing sector. The American automotive sector is on the decline, of which there are many reasons. The large bureaucracy/organizational structures created in the 50's stifles risk taking, creativity, and innovation. Also, the outdated concept of the UAW (Note: research nonunionized plants in the US owned by foreign competitors, BMW/Toyota, and how much more nimble they are to adapt, esp. to flexible manufacturing)."

2008-07-30,1.0,"Ford is dying It is a familyoriented company, meaning that it values worklife balance and allows you to spend plenty of time with your family.  Other than that, I do not believe there are any good reasons to work at Ford.Ford is a dying company.  It has been downsizing since 2001.  It is looking to cut costs everywhere, which means it hasn't given a pay raise to anyone in over 2.5 years and it has slashed benefits.  When I joined the company out of college, they recruited me on the following platform: ""Come work for Ford and we'll pay for your MBA at an evening program in the area, such as U of M.""  Well, I started the program earlier this year, and Ford suddenly discontinued their tuition assistance program, telling us we could just drop out of school if we couldn't afford to keep going.  I was promised a promotion back in April, and then it got delayed until July, and then until this upcoming October, but now it might simply be canceled altogether.Ford used to be a great company.  Unfortunately, it is a very unprofitable, poorly managed company that will betray its employees in order to save a buck."
2008-07-31,3.0,"Work here for Benefits, Comp, but beware of Upside Potential and Firm's long term outlook Good compensation, good benefits, potential for long term stability if present issues are solved.Significant business challenges lie ahead, making the overall prognosis for success unclear. Very difficult to get promoted unless you are deemed a star. Limited opportunities until the business climate improves. Poor feedback on performance and very little opportunity for recognition for success."

Great core group of people who care about running the business correctly.Safety is a real concern and taken very seriously.Instability of job market. Current job market is very limited, much of advancement opportunity has been extremely limited in the last few years due to reduction in plants / volumes.  Work environment can be a bit harsh if you are in the factory.As with many very large companies things do not move quickly on due to the layers of management approval and paperwork required."

They are changing many of their business practices to global processes, it is exciting and a good experience being able to input and influence the company during these exciting times. Many jobs offer the opportunity to travel and see/experience different parts of the country/world.Shrinking market share in a shrinking industry lots of job reductions lately.  Limited annual salary increases (~35%, with 0% some years due to industry struggles).  Recently cancelled tuition reimbursement.  MetroDetroit isn't just an OK area relative to other major cities.  Some chimney's between different organizations still exist, much better that it was 510 years ago.  Some of the skills and experiences are automotive specific and may not be transferable outside the industry.  Seems to be a lot of layers of middle management.  Potential of offshoring some the current positions."
2008-08-13,2.0,"We never knew how good the good old days were. The salary and benefits were very very good, unfortunatly many people were grossly over compensated.  When the domestic auto industry was solid it was a great place to work.It's so big and clumsy there is a tremendous inertia to change.  The last 3 years most everyone was afraid of losing their jobs they either did nothing or tried to stand out and get noticed it created what I call ""bad behavior"" and drove wasteful ideas and programs out of despiration."
2008-08-13,4.0,Great place to work but will not be around long in current market. The ability to change careers and stay at the same compnay is the best reason to stay.Ford is a company that has its heart in the right place but in an industry that is failing. The will continue to do great things but the job prospects are limited and there will be no advancement.

Diversity of job opportunities, when not blocked by management.Intense market pressure constraining R&D and subsequently the ability to develop new products. Employee morale extremely low."
2008-08-29,3.0,Ford has it's challenges Big company experience. Challenging industry provides interesting opportunities. You will likely be able to work on some significant projects as the company attempts to re invent itself. There is a need for a lot of analysis and decision making (although decision making is only done at VP / Director levels).Don't go into your job thinking that you will make a difference. Ford is a large company and it is also very tall and top heavy. In many departments there are an equal number of analysts to supervisors and supervisors to managers. This tends to limit the upward mobility within the company. Also the company has just gone through a few rounds of layoff eliminating people at the bottom. Another issue is the continual benefits cuts. Every year the company cuts more benefits. They are not in a situation to give bonuses either.
2008-09-03,3.0,"good place to work if you don't mind being part of a shrinking company The best reason to work at Ford Motor is to be a part of a 100 year old company with the heritage that comes along.  If you have a passion for automobiles this can be a great place to work.  Not many other companies produce exciting products like Ford can and does.  Dearborn can be a great place to raise a family.Eroding market share makes everything difficult  budgets are always being cut, no more extras or small perks you may be used to at other companies, and a logjam of qualified people who have been waiting for promotion longer than you."
2008-09-04,4.0,"If you can keep your job, it wouldn't be a bad place to work. Work wasn't bad, it was quite exciting to work on cars.  The 17 holidays and other benfits are great.  I got 9 months salary severance, you cant beat that.It seems you need to have a ""champion"" or friend in the ranks to move up.  The Blackbelt program was good until they downsized it and blended it into the rest of the company. Oh, and the company is downsizing every month so getting a job and keeping it would be a challenge."
2008-09-04,2.0,Ford could easly impove gas milege if they had the right programers. They have been around for more then 100 years. They have a family that back them. They useto pay good. It was a good job 10 years ago.They do not have any product that you can aford to buy or put gas in it. The bosses were to busy for the last 20 years making there millions then leaving. No one invested in the furture. They let the goverment and countrys outside the US walk all over them. Now they are tring to catchup by getting rid of all ther experanced people because they are are cutting cost. Who is going to run this Company? New hires from Mexico or China. They are way to heavy in there upper management. Who many VPs' do you need? Henry Ford is rolling over in his grave!!!

Very talented workforce.Poor overall performance of the company has trickle down effect on professional development and career advancement.

2008-09-14,3.0,"Ford Motor Most supervisors support a great work life balance which includes telecommuting, alternative work schedules, etcetera.  Alan Mulally's hiring was a turning point in the company.  Morale has increased and it seems like for the first time in a while the culture of 'doing things a certain way because that is how it has always been done' was questioned.  Hiring Alan was the best thing the company could have done.Working for a company that doesn't make money is not easy  so far in 2008 the raises which should have been effective April 1 were delayed to October 1 and other benefits were also cut (life insurance for retirees, tuition assistance, etc).  However, starting salaries are competitive."

Decent pay and benefits, but they have scaled back over the past 56 years so I don't know how new employees would view the packages.Automotive industry is slow and risky.  Big bonuses or big layoffs.  In engineering, there's not much 'engineering' going on.  It's mostly the suppliers that do the 'real' work.  Most engineers are miniproject managers of sorts.  The culture is pretty stagnant...there's not much/no feedback or changes from Pulse Surveys and many people feel like they need to watch their back or not speak up since it's a culture of being judged in your performance review if you stand up for what you think is correct."

Decided lack of integrity among many of the ""old school"" employees, those who grew up with their daddy and grandpa working in the industry and think they are entitled to ""perks"".  Also, the entire culture of this company rewards people for short term decisions that hurt the company in the long term."

Product Design Engineers have the freedom to dictate the direction his/her parts take in the development process. As long as you make sound engineering judgements, preferably with data to back up your reasoning, your management will support you. Also, you get a breath of experience as a Ford PD Engr such as managing suppliers on the technical aspects of the job (designing, prototyping, testing, etc), interacting with program management and purchasing about cost and timing, and dealing with plants to resolve assembly issues. Whether you decide to stay at Ford longterm or not, a PD experience at Ford will definitely help you develop engineering skills that will transfer well to other technical industries.You are responsible for your own recognition and career development. Upper management will not notice you unless you make yourself seen and heard. Those who resolve a crisis quickly with flying colors (although they may have caused the problem in the first place) tend to be noticed more than those who do their job the right way the first time and fly under the radar. You definitely need to constantly update your superiors on what successes you have been achieving every couple of weeks so they don't forget you during PR and promotion time.

Entering as a college graduate, I had the possibility to move across multiple organizations within Ford (product development, marketing & sales, manufacturing and finance). This may still be an option, but seems very limited as employees are worried to 'start new' in a different organization when further layoffs are looming. At this point, I believe Ford still offers a very good benefits package.The company is too large and stuck in a bureaucratic process that slows down project turnaround time. Also, outsourcing many of its IT components has a negative impact on company morale. Why should employees believe in their company when their jobs are going overseas?  And even more importantly, who will buy 'American' and Ford products when all the work is done in India and Asia?"

So free ski tickets.  airline miles and hotel points accumulate rapidly.Well, unless you've been living under a rock, the biggest downside has been the hemorrhaging of cash.  The dealer network is too saturated.  There is a bad quality perception (unnecessary these days).  The company is very hierarchal.  The management pyramid is very steep and with all of the layoffs, movement isn't going to happen much in the near term.  They're looking where to scrimp.  They've been hammering at individual and family deductibles and premiums, obligating the employee to shoulder more of the cost.  They don't pay very well.

Most manager positions would qualify for senior level management responsibilities in other companies.2) The sales and marketing career track rewards a broad based, generalist knowledge of both the sales and marketing career diciplines.  You must be sucessful at both to suceed!3) Managers at Ford are flexible and adaptable, due to a previous culture of being reassigned (promoted based on merit) and the willingness to relocate.   Seasoned employees are comfortable with a certain amount of unplanned activity and readily adapt to meet challegenges and support the business.4) Starting out, you will get an opportunity every 23 years, to a) learn a new job;  b) make a contribution; c) move forward, based on performance.  Jumps between starting levels (GSR) are small and very reachable.  It is easy to see the next step and work toward that target.   You have great managers and coaches to help you.1) Promotions and professional development are stagnent at mid senior level (MR, , SC & PSR) levels.  The same employess who excelled and survived at the first levels get sent to Dearborn and  rot in the same (or similar) job.   Promotions are extremely limited.2) The executive level is very difficult to join.   There is a ceiling.  3) Anyone with an advanced degree should only consider coming to Ford if you can join one of the leadership programs. The company won't reward you or consider you for an executive position otherwise.  4) Death by a thousand cuts....  In Dearborn, Ford has cut about 42,000 employess  (from c. 60,000)since 2000.  They are roughly onethird the size they were eight years ago.  However, many of these losses seemed to have been replaced by what appear to be H1B Visa workers.

In accordance with my skill set, I primarily worked on internal webbased application development.  Overall, I appreciate the experience I was able to gain there, although like most IT jobs, the position had its trials and tribulations.The two supervisors at the Houghton office are great to work with and the manager is very flexible about scheduling.  Assigned projects are based on experience and skill set, though almost all work is grounded in either Java or C++, with any database and/or web design knowledge being a big plus.  Pay was very good compared to most other opportunities in the area, and there were even a few fringe benefits as a mere supplemental employee.Communication with the rest of my project teams in Dearborn was sometimes a struggle.  Getting everyone together for a phone or video conference was tough, so email and wordofmouth were heavily relied upon, occasionally resulting in gaps.  Most people I was in contact with were cooperative and helpful, though a few strays needed a kick in the pants from their respective supervisors.Ford employs many thicklyaccented foreigners, which can sometimes compound communication issues.  Patience is simply the key in those situations.Opportunities for significant advancement are unlikely in the shortterm, with the auto industry the way it is.  Still, I thought Ford was being competently run during my time there, and its revitalized fleet of products should position the company to enjoy any sort of economic turnaround, should one come in the near future."

If you work in Vehicle Operations at any facility in the Ford system, you are exposed to a very fastpaced environment that maximizes your ability to multitask and to make decisions on both inductive and deductive reasoning. Your leadership skills and fortitude will be constantly tested. Because the company annually ranks in Fortune's top 20 companies, Ford's size and scale makes your resume stand out to prospective employers.The constant tension of dealing in a union environment can be debilitating. If you are a creative professional, you may find yourself consistently stifled by the framework of the labor agreement and the overall environment in which you work. In summary, Ford offers challenges that do not necessarily require a technical expertise or advanced degree in order to excel. Just thick skin and a willingness to endure an onslaught of repetitive, banal tasks.Also, because auto is a mature industry and Ford has been in business for over 100 years, growth is limited. Promotional opportunities are limited thanks to several years of salary staff reductions and those that remain are holding firm to their jobs in the tough economy.

The company offers very competitive benefits and salary, and have policies in place for very flexible work schedules and arrangements to help support worklife integration.Hours can be long.  The consecutive years of rightsizing the company have cut the employee base to the bare minimum necessary to operate.  Thus we're all working very hard.

Loose, illdefined job descriptions act as enablers to some rather unfair treatment.  Sometimes, after someone (generally female)  leaves a general salary roll position, the job, without any change in content, is then reclassified as low level management and a ‘chosen employee’ (typically male) gets the newly reclassified job.  Clerical work also gets disproportionately allocated to women.  Ford has work/life policies that look good on paper, but these policies are sometimes administered unfairly by middle management; a ‘wrong’ reason or misplaced inquiry about the ‘transitional work arrangement (an optional part time work program, which is offered to allat least on paper)’ can result in a voluntary package.  The new performance review system results in some employees being labeled “low achievers.”  Instead of attaching a label to employees, why not label their job performance?Ford is figuratively a different company depending on what division you work in.

2010-06-20,2.0,"Working for Ford is submitting to a life that is mediocre and uninspiring. Some people don't mind that; I do. Generally good work life balance. However, it depends on the organization you are in. The company is doing well for a US automaker. Good name recognition on a resume. You start in a rotational program, so you get to move to a different area every 18 months. They also will pay for parttime MBA programs, but you are required to work at Ford for 2 years after completing that.Living in Michigan is the number one downside for me. If you can get past that, another downside is that there is little opportunity for career advancement. The company is still far too top heavy and moving from Analyst to Supervisor is not easy and generally takes an MBA and 8+ years. There are many people who work at Ford who are basically incompetent and getting paid $90K+ year. They have been there forever, are still Analysts and will never become Supervisors. It is frustrating working with these people knowing how much more they are getting paid and how much worse they are at their job than me. Ford and Michigan are very uninspiring places to work."

You may have contributed outstanding accomplishments to the firm, but if your boss is not willing to actively support you in front of his personnel committee then you will go nowhere!The backbiting finally go to me.  With ongoing staff reductions, managers were short on staff and I actually had my new employee stolen from me (personnel committee head usurped her, and I did not find out until she failed to show on her planned first day of work!).

It is almost abusive the amount of work that is placed on employees at all levels of the organization.

The leadership team is focused on the success of the business at the expense of the workforce.  The Company is making large profits but employees are still purchasing their own stationary supplies due to the level of approval required to purchase pens and paper.  Also, the compensation programs will force early  career people to leave after only a few years if they hope to grow their salary.  With only a 2.7% merit increase in most years, someone would have to leave the company to keep their salary growing in hopes of building enough personal wealth to retire someday.

Since mass layoffs occurred in 2009 and again in 2011, opportunities have declined.  We are operating at the same sales/receivable level with 2/3 of the former staff  longer hours, more responsibility.  Why a company that requires workers to work 60 hours a week to complete their job functions thinks they can cut staff by 2/3 and still remain sucessfull is beyond me.  If you work hard and are a top performer, don't expect to get promoted  that goes to the people who know the right managers.  Seen plenty of people promoted to the top echelons just based on superficial attitudes and low quality work.

I have never worked for a company where the people cared so much for the products they make. There is a great sense of accomplishment because you get to work on a product people love. Also, I have never worked for a company where people respected their CEO as much as Ford employees respect Alan Mulally. He is a great leader and a genuine person who has done a tremendous job at bringing Ford back to being a market leader.As with working with any large corporation there can be a lot of hoops to jump through. In particular if you need anything done by IT you have submit a work ticket and then wait forever  for it to actually get done (if it does not get lost). Or you have to call and pester someone to get it done quicker."

2013-09-25,3.0,"Thoughts on the FCG Program FCG (Ford College Graduate) Program allows you to get hired from college and get great insight into the company by trying out 3 yearly positions (rotations).  You get to try out positions you pick.  You may pick almost anything you want, but with some controls.  i.e. not all Ford positions are available.  Only those whose manager is open to having an FCG work for them.  Also, if two or more people vie for one position, only one of those people gets it.  The rest go with their 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choices.FCG Program gives you a way to evaluate Ford and for Ford to evaluate you.  FCG Program allows this to happen much faster than if you were hired directly into Ford outside of the FCG program.  The Program also gives you opportunities to move fields on a whim, where otherwise you would more likely stay in your general chosen area.FCG program is there to try things at Ford, but one can potentially overshoot themselves and fail.  i.e. it is possible to select a position you are not qualified for and currently there are no controls to avoid that situation. This is on purpose.  You get to try things at Ford, you pick the positions, and it feels like you are in control.But you need to be mindful that while you are selecting and working your positions, Ford management and HR watch your performance levels and if they drop too low, may take action.  HR trumps FCG Program.That means you cannot truly ""try a position"".   You need to use care in selecting your rotations and you need to be able to do the job well, or else you may find yourself being released from the program and back into the wild.  FCG advisors will guide you, but they will not always caution you on your selection, or be able to help you when things get really tough.Not all rotations end up being the way they were stated on paper.  For example, a highly technical role may end up being doing research on a software package and putting together a software configuration document.  Or a technical developer role where you expect to write code may end up being a usability analyst where you do research instead.A lot of roles are ambiguous, because Ford work is ambiguous.  There is lots of overhead meetings & paperwork, to figure out what to do, and things change, so it is natural that some positions end up not matching their written description by the time you get to them.  Sometimes roles change as you are working them, and you may find your position description change quite a bit.  In the same vein, being a large company, Ford management moves around.  Sometimes you find that managers change or leave, as you get to your position, but that is more rare."

Your career is essentially over. They imply that if you come to work for them (usually with a pay cut from your previous position), you will eventually get back to your present level of income and responsibility.  They are not being truthful.  This is especially true in the GSR (nonmanagerial) ranks.  People come to work for a company for many reasons.  If you want to work a reasonable 4550 hrs./week with few weekends in a job that is less challenging than the one you have, Ford is the place for you.

I've learned to adapt on the fly at this job because I come across many different people in the field and I also learned how to handle the many different personalities I meet. My co-workers are awesome and very helpful. The hardest part of the job I would say is the many days that we have to travel on the road and the distances I may have to travel at times. the most enjoyable part of the job is the traveling and getting out and seeing Texas.

Within HQ, people are often moved around... one  can continue to advance knowledge and skills. Some senior leaders  like Joe Hinrichs, Kumar Galhotra, and even new CEO Mark Fields  are sometimes willing to take smart risks to drive the company forward as the world continues to change. People are paid well for their work. Benefits are solid. Working for a Fortune 10 company is always good on a resume.The politics, especially on the communications team, are unbelievable. Half of your time will be spent walking on eggshells as not to upset anyone and to stay on the good side of a few management team members so you can actually accomplish anything. The company claims to have a creative mindset where ideas are welcome, but that only applies to those ""in"" with senior leaders, who may turn on you quickly.  People here learn to be experts on what leadership wants, not experts on social media or PR, which means there is a lack of creative, groundbreaking work. Teamwork is not encouraged or celebrated. Mentoring is actually discouraged. Turnover rate on this team was extraordinarily high while I was there  12 people/month on average for the last few years."

You have to work 12 hours to get paid for 10.  The schedule dictates that you work those hours, but they won't pay you for all of your time.  If you work 11 hours, you get no overtime.  Telecommuting is viewed as a negative, if it is even permitted at all.  You are held hostage in your current position.  The only way to be allowed to try something new is if you basically burn your bridges.  They have this thing called the ""One Ford Behaviors"" (available online if you search it) that would be great if they were followed and interpreted correctly.  Data is not used to make decisions.  Standard processes are not followed.  Being a team player is one of the behaviors, but if you follow most of the other expected behaviors, you are labeled as not being a team player.  If you stand up for what is right, you are judged as not working well with others.  Status quo is preferred over continuous improvement."

2014-10-28,4.0,Fast A typical day I would go threw the line to ensure there is proper stock and tools for all operators. I stated as an operator and was promoted to team leader after a year. I worked with management very closely to ensure that we were producing a quality product in the proper amount of time in a safe work place with all proper PPE. I was in charge of making any and all repair from my work zone and ensure that there made correctly.

2014-10-28,4.0,"A very well structured that could stand to loosen up a bit Ford is a global company which can allow for a great variance in experience there. Management is generally wellguided and moves with purpose, and the lower management staff are very well trained in supporting their direct reports.Compensation is fair, although promotions can be tough to acquire if you're not good at being memorable and likeable. Benefits are pretty good, but not outstanding. While there's a great push for work/life balance (relaxed dress code, alternate work schedules, very few supervisors ""watch the clock"" for your coming and going, etc), it's clear that the higher you go up the food chain, the more you're expected to give up.While each department runs like a welloiled machine in most regards, crossdepartment interaction can be tenuous. Everyone is very disciplined in their skillset, but the various processes and structures don't mesh well in other areas. This creates confusion, gaps in timing and understanding, and animosity among some players. It doesn't help that upper management, at least from an IT perspective, doesn't seem to be willing to push too hard to help remedy these problems."

2014-11-02,2.0,"Process Coach in machining. Required to coach UAW operators and trades to run production and repair equipment. Wage, $80  $100k, decent to good benefits. Some great managers and employees.Other positions / departments are more satisfying then this machining department. I am told by many it is one of the most difficult.UAW protects employees who need it (do not do their jobs). Some of upper management can not or will not back the process coach in debate against the UAW. Most union operators and Trades are very unmotivated and if the Process Coach pushes them to work they will find a way to do less and then report the Process Coach to labor relation for offensive behavior. So for example if upper management sends the command that all operators must clean their operations then Process Coach goes to all Operators and says ""please clean your area better before the end of shift"" the operators get together and decide they will all go to labor relations at separate times and report offensive language or aggressive behavior on the process coach, who is then disciplined. The process coach training does not cover much of the actual difficulties of the position. If the operators want overtime they can and will find a way to stall production so weekend production is scheduled. Weekend production is only an issue because the Process Coach is only paid their base pay no 1 1/2 or double time for mandatory overtime. Managers are known to schedule meetings before or after start of shifts requiring employees to  work unpaid over time every day.Salary are required to present projects they have never seen before because they are not involved in the projects. Due to the tremendous amount of work load they have they do not have time to work on projects, leadership knows this but it is easier to force an unfinished report so the presenter looks unprepared."

2014-12-11,5.0,"Pretty Amazing Place Ford is awesome. Every day I am surrounded by engineers who put in a lot of work and effort to make sure the best they can do is going into their work. Work hours are very flexible, lots of autonomy,  there is no micromanaging at all. Managers/ supervisors are so approachable and willing to help its ridiculous ( I am a new hire and know a few higher level managers and can email them or instant message them anytime and they always respond and are very helpful). Pay is competitive, benefits are good. It's a very big company, so work/life balance fluctuates depending where you go, but for the most part I'd say its pretty good. Plenty of opportunities to travel all over the world, I was almost sent to Spain for 2 weeks within my first 4 months of working. Ford gives you from a little before Christmas to a couple days after new years off as part of just holiday time off, not part of your vacation. So this is an additional like 2 weeks of paid vacation, on top of your vacation days (HUGE pro). Its an awesome place to work, I have been very pleased.Michigan is gorgeous in the summer, but is a very gloomy cold place in the winter. If you don't like the cold or are not used to it, this is a big con. Detroit isn't as bad as most people think, but there are some sketchy areas (some incredible ones too). In some departments (crash and safety engineering for instance) work/life balance is not good. For most people, during 4th of July you are forced to use 4 vacation days.. this sucks because you only get 10 your fist couple of years. Facilities where you work are very dated and ugly. Makes for kind of a gloomy environment. There are a lot of cons that you will get just because Ford is so huge, like dealing with IT, that will be the same pretty much any time you work for a big company though, lots of communication holdups and delays."
2014-12-11,2.0,"Low-quality engineers and treats people like children Ford offers employees the ability to rotate into other parts of the business (and even requires this for college graduates).  They offer tuition assistance, a patent rewards program and some unique benefits (ie. use of Ford lawyers for certain personal cases).Leadership seems to be a huge problem within my organization.  Nobody wants to take charge to make a product truly excellent, people just want to coast by without doing any hard work.  A week stuck in meetings is a successful week to a lot of these people, even if no quantifiable work gets done after all the meetings.Ford treats employees like children.  Employees have to go to mandatory hourlong ""trainings"" that basically tell you not to post confidential material on social networks and not to accept bribes from customers.  IT sends out emails like ""Cyber Steve learns about safe Web browsing"" with a picture of a little cartoon IT guy telling you to use a secure password.  It's insulting to be a professional engineer and having people treat you like a child.Another big problem is Ford promotes peopled based on how long you've been with the company instead of the quality of your work.  This leads to, for example, an IT employee being promoted to supervisor of a production software team just because he's been at Ford the longest.  These are just two different worlds and they don't mesh well together, which is why some of these production products are a disaster.  People should be promoted based on the quality of their work, not for how many years they can sit behind the same desk.I have yet to meet someone at Ford who understands the difference between good software and bad software.  People seem to think that if ""it works"" then it's good software and the project is good to ship.  No!  That is absolutely wrong!  Just because the software works in a blackbox test environment doesn't mean it's robust, readable, flexible or maintainable.  Some of the software I've seen has been an absolute nightmare and my superiors refuse to let me make it any better because ""it already works"".  Come back to me in 5 years when you have to make a change that becomes impossible to implement and tell me ""it works""."

Great place to work.Behind in Transmission technology, Ford College Graduate Program last 3 years, lack of diversity, most engineering buildings are very plain and gray with few windows (doesn't include Research and Advanced Engineering Bldg.), Ford has had fewer ""exciting"" products, Lincoln is behind as a ""luxury"", Ford doesn't know how to make big leaps forward with new products."

The company advertises like employees are very satisfied, but many of my coworkers don't agree. First, they highly regard lineworkers (UAW) than competitors, but hardworking regular salaried employees are treated with a dropinabucket annual bonuses. Second, their employee discounts are laughable. My friend who is not a Ford employee can buy a Ford car for cheaper price. Third, employees' vacation days are one week less than the competitor in Warren, MI. If hired, you start with two weeks' vacation days, but the new hires at the competitor in Warren, MI start with three weeks."

There's a lot of respect for top management within the organization.I understand why Ford has the rules they have in place for contractors, but the end result is that the contractor is treated with suspicion  although it's better on some teams than others.  Also, contractors are not paid any more than Ford employees even though they receive none of the benefits that Ford employees do even though they are doing the same job.  It's nearly impossible to get a raise because Ford considers contractors as ""hired guns"" who are hired to do a single job.  The reality is that no one there does only what they were hired to do.  Management ignores the fact that contractors take on other roles, outside their original responsibility, and should be paid more for it."

Also Ford encourages its employees to telecommute once a week typically Friday, but it isn't required.Unless you live in Dearborn, the commute to work is pretty bad, traffic on Southfield (M39)  or 94 is pretty bad.

Too often requires work on your scheduled days off, and you basically have to not show up against threats of write-ups to use any of the non-scheduled paid days off in your benefits package. This is a cut throat environment in which management plays unethical games to write up anyone to take the heat off themselves, and tries to pressure you into doing the same with your employees. The rotating schedule is brutal at times, and it sucks to be required to work so many hours and not be compensated (i.e. 1.5 or 2X, to compensate).  This is not a position in which you will move up. Turnover is way too high, so upper management will do everything in its power to keep production management exactly where they are."

Ford provides great health and dental benefits as well as educational benefits for college and self improvement purposes. Use them to keep your mind sharp and life interesting.Little room to climb in the company. Long hours due to a variety of modern scheduling programs. Every department has different scheduling systems which do not coincide. Creates animosity, absenteeism,  and competition to get in to specific departments. Very little overtime due to scheduling. Due to Tier Two systems and plant closures high seniority from other locations have come, some paid,  to this plant, forcing the majority of original Van Dyke employees to undesired shifts. Unless you have 20 years plus, you won't get to pick your shift. Under 15 years and you'll more than likely be stuck on afternoon shift until you retire.

Product strategists can often be obtuse about advanced technology/ideas and squelch creativity, despite the executive management's stated commitments to innovation... it seems they want to be the first company to offer exciting new features (e.g., SYNC, aluminum F150, etc), but internally it seems many of strategists consider features only after the competition offers them... which resembles a ""follower"" attitude, not that of a leader."

After being placed in a work environment that was filled with several ""Good Old Boys"" who all had an unbelievable hatred for anyone with a different sexual orientation, that team worked very hard to make my life as miserable as they could during my term with them, including stealing from me, tampering with meals that I brought to work, openly making hateful jokes and remarks about gay people, and making repeated efforts to get me terminated.  Well, finally after I was struck by an individual with a large ""Mag"" flashlight, and because I simply pushed him away from me in an attempt to prevent any additional strikes to me, my career was stolen from me, and my life has been ruined as a result.  Not only were the ""Good Old Boys"" active in the efforts to rob me of my career and future, but every supervisor that was in charge of my work area worked closely with them in their efforts.  It took them about four years to achieve their goal, after all, my work record was exemplary, and only after defending my personal safety were they able to finally find success for their efforts, the local UAW, and my committee man would do nothing to correct the gross injustice that was done to me.  I can tell you that, although Ford Motor Company makes claims that they value diversity, and work to create an all inclusive work environment, the fact is that on the ""shop floor"", there is no real effort to attain an allinclusive, nondiscriminatory workplace.  Keep your eyes open, a book to detail my journey may be coming."

2015-05-28,4.0,"Inclusive, Innovative and Evolving Company Ford Motor is a 'family' business with an amazing story that dates back more than 110 years. Led by a terrific senior leadership team, the company is evolving to meet the consumer and employee demands of today and tomorrow.Since the company was created by Henry Ford, where he instituted the $5 minimum wage  unheard of at the time  the business has given its employees fair wages and provided hundreds of thousands of everyday people the means to become part of the middle class.Given the numbers of years that Ford has been in the business, many of its facilities are outdated and do not align with the expectations of the new generation of employees. These settings can be a  somewhat of a 'buzzkill' and inhibit creative and innovative thinking the business wants. Although the executive leadership team is pushing for greater transparency, openness, and acceptance doing things differently, many middle manager are still stuck in there conservative habits of formality and nontransparency. This lack of acceptance is an impediment to the evolution of the company in this new era of 'mobility'."

2015-06-16,1.0,"Working on Contract in Ford Ford is a big brand name.Compensation and work life balance is good.If you are working on contract in Ford Motors, job security is very poor. You may get fired for very silly reasons. Contract employees are all expendable. Dare not speak or have opinion or present ideas that your supervisor does not approve. Just follow orders. Do not expect a career at FORD!!!!Zero training and orientation provided for new contract employees, and are expected to deliver as if you have 10 year experience working in the company. Processes are very cumbersome, and any engineering change you try to make, takes ages to go through. Gigantic size of company and, poor process flows and red tape are a major problem. Nobody in the company can explain the exact process when consulted.Company does not want smart and intelligent contact employees, but only workforce that follows given orders. Do not expect you can put in new ideas and innovate at Ford.Management is very crappy. Projects are shuffled every 6 months, so you got to hand over and take over new projects. Projects are literally dumped on you. This leads to complete loss in tempo, and have to start from scratch.Engineering Data, reports and history is not carefully documented and stored in database to retrieve by new people. Horrible state of affairs. WERS is the most outdated tool you got to work with, which reminds of user interface in the 1960s.D&R is a scape"

2015-07-07,3.0,"No salary- Pay isn't consistent for salesmen. Great health & dental insurance. You get what you put out. Money is based off of your effort.Salesmen only make commission Therefore, a slow season means no money for salesmen. This may not be an issue for dealerships in high traffic areas...but for more rural locations, a slow season can be lethal. Example: January and February are the worst. Everyone spends too much during Christmas, therefore no one is looking to buy a car right after the holidays. No one coming into the dealership means salesman aren't getting paychecks. The salesman who have enough clientele from years of working there might have a few 'repeat customers' come in to buy from them, but usually a slow season is bad for everyone. Also, the dealership doesn't drug test (at least the one I work at) they say they 'might' in the paperwork but they never do. This is a big problem when you out know management is doing drugs on the premises. Management at my particular dealership is crooked... That's not every dealership though. If sales stayed more consistent, I would have no reason to leave. But with a second child on the way, I need more consistency for my family... And this particular dealership doesn't pull in enough money for me to take care of my family properly."

The ONE FORD culture really shows around the office  coworkers care, and go out of their to help with whatever it is you're facing. Management has got your back. Even HR has never let me down. Over the years I've cut my teeth on quality car design, and even though I realize I'm just a small cog in a huge machine, I feel like I matter. Plus, anytime I see a vehicle rolling down the road that I had a hand in, I well with pride. Ford makes cars for the everyman, and I think that is something to be commended.GO FORD WOOT WOOT WOOTRundown stereotypical cubical farm buildings, occasionally cumbersome bureaucracy, churn due to system updates and changing culture."

Boss's never tell the truth and only worry about covering their own hind end.

Very high salary for some with limited experience. I work in Information Management now Global Data.  They want to grow the departments and will pay quite a bit to keep you from going elsewhere. I recommend getting in good with your supervisor and manager.  Be able to sell yourself even if you do not feel qualified. They will buy it, have strength in how you portray yourself. Focus on mirroring their style and you will go far.Not many cons other than trying to keep up with the ever changing political landscape is scary. If you are no longer their favorite, you will feel it and possibly be ostracized. Group mobbing is prevalent and affects morale when you see good workers outed. My advice: stay on the in. You may not make real changes or innovate because questioning the statusquo is frowned upon, but you will stay in good standing."

I wish my situation were isolated but it seems that about half of the latest crop of supervisors were all lured in under the same false pretenses. When you interview, they'll tell you a few other things: that you'll only work a 4day 10hr schedule (during the day), that you have vacation and personal days which you can take anytime, that you'll get paid overtime for every minute you work over 40hrs, and that you'll only occasionally supervise a small number of skilled tradesmen. All of these promises are at the very least misleading. I've been on the night shift for over a year now. We work long days (routinely over 12hrs often more), most of the weekends (going on 3/4 this month) and rarely receive the aforementioned compensation. You are allowed to request vacation, but it's always going to be denied. Instead they tell you (often when it's not convenient) when you will take your vacation.

2016-06-08,3.0,"Research Scientist In research, you're surrounded by very talented peers.  There's a strong management push for collaboration, so even if people on the ground aren't keen, you can always fall back on ""One Ford"" and find the right person to connect with.  research engineers are also paid pretty well, and benefit options are good. Lots of lower managers are accommodating of new ideas, at least in research.The biggest con is that most of us have no career prospects. No one ever gets promoted into management, period.  There's been a flurry of activity the last few months, but it's all targeted at pet projects or the current hot area, and it's mostly upper management shuffles.  No one from the general salaried ranks is getting promoted into even the lowest level of leadership.  we're all fairly wellpaid but depressed about how we're going nowhere.  but we've got families to support, and benefits are good, so what are our options?  it's a running joke between most employees, but no one is laughing.Ford likes to tout all the career resources it provides, like online training, assessments, etc, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you have no actual career prospects. and i'd say 85% of employees have accepted that they will never be promoted out of General Salary, not even after 30 years of service.Also, purchasing is cumbersome. You can't buy anything without going through like 4 layers of management.  Buyers will overrule your own order and resource your request so you end up with a lesser or incompatible item.  People buy inferior things or make shady repairs all the time because there's never any approved budget to buy the right tools."

2016-10-28,2.0,"Boring... Not stressful, stable pay, sense of family, as long as the company sells F150's and some other SUV's, we are cool.Boring, lots of old systems and processes, lots of bureaucracy and backstabbing, careless managers.The pay is steady, but the growth is super slow while your soul gets crashed.The Dearborn campus area is in general dull, kinda disgusting, very old and dirty. Some cafeterias are really bad (only pizza and burgers) and very expensive. They said remodeling is coming, but I guess by the time that happens, this place would be plagued by Indians, the only people that love this kind of environment.Lots of untalented people even though there is a very stringent online system that filters out lots of great local people so that in the end we end up with importing unfit, cheap labor, specially from India, who drag down our annual incentives and make our kids rethink STEM.I think bad decisions are being taken: a lot of investment in ""mobility"" and software, yet no clear path on how to execute that vision and generate revenue. A lot of dependency on trucks, yet we says its unprofitable to sell small cars. Toyota somehow is the number 1...Example, ""let's reduce the weight of the gas tank as much as we can, like paper wall, so that it costs next to nothing to manufacture"", ""let's add a fourfigure dollar software feature that nobody uses but looks cool"".No clear strategy on how to top Tesla in the EV world. Old roots seem to be too entangled to allow green innovation; maybe engineering politics have to do with it, along with cross ""favors"" from suppliers."

Pay is not as competitive as GM (so I hear). Chance to move up in management are very difficult and require long hours / high stress. Management stress levels are high. Slow to innovate. Culture overall is diverse compared to the location. Can be clicky and some pessimism. Lots of process, which stumps innovation."

2016-11-30,4.0,"Electrical Systems Engineer and former FCG  Great work life balance Relaxed culture Comprehensive benefits Very competitive pay A lot of opportunity due to aging engineering workforce Promotions are entirely determined by politics and how willing your manager is to argue with other managers. There are only a finite amount of highrankings to award, so these are awarded to those with 25 years experience and nothing is left for employees under 30. Working remotely is not a serious option, no one respects it in the culture. Software used by engineers is extraordinarily outdated. Ford as an organization refuses to outsource any engineering tools, preferring to make and maintain their own versions. Case in point AVBOM: a tool designed to improve a legacy DOS screen (that somehow still gets used everyday...), instead of being a sensible software tool, is a visual basic macrofilled excel spreadsheet that works more slowly than DOS itself. All engineers must use this single tool for part number management everywhere in the company, despite its errors and limitations."

First they said I would be working in the city in which I lived, then told me that the job was actually across the country, but that I'd be given relocation.  After being employed for 8 weeks, I was then told I would NOT be receiving the relocation package they promised.  After being employed for 10 months, my salary was reduced by nearly 25% because of an ""administrative error"" that they realized during an audit.  When I finally left the company, they did not pay me my final paycheck or my leftover PTO, at least not until I got a lawyer involved.  They also sent me 3 different versions of my W2, which of course created a nightmare when trying to complete my taxes.  I could go on and on..."

2016-12-17,1.0,"AWFUL! Ford pays better than GM. The PDC (Product Development Center was easy to access from many freeways.This was the worst experience working in the automotive industry I've had to date.  Design and engineering are completely at odds with one another and they prevent each other from achieving their goals on time. So every design project is late, rushed and done poorly.  Overtime is abundant, but the stress associated with finishing a project is too high a cost.  What eventually will happen is the project will again be delayed and you will find yourself working OT under the same stressful circumstances of design and engineering not making sound decisions.  The worst part is as a sculptor, you will get blamed for the inefficiencies by the poorly managed studio environment.  Meanwhile, when you glance around most coworkers are spending their time watching YouTube, pretending to work OT.  Any assistance with training or understanding their backwards system is nonexistent and the guys who have spent their careers at Ford treat you like a moron for not walking in and getting how things are done.  The employee culture there is mean spirited, bigotry is rampant and the good old boys mentality is preventative of positive and openmindedness .  The attitudes are archaic and they do not foster understanding towards family obligations. Most people will work a minimum of 12 hour days and many work Saturdays and Sundays.  Hands down the worst experience I have ever had working in my life."

2017-02-08,1.0,"Ford Seating Dept Nothing worth writing about, anything you can get from Ford you can get from other OEMS like GM and Chrysler.Terrible work environment; dark windowless corner of the building.  Management continually likes to change expectations for deliverables or add deliverables that cannot be reached by designated milestones.  Very very difficult to deliver a program given the massive number of processes and rules that must be followed.  Expectation is you are available 24/7 (cell phone has to always be on).  They might say ""family first"" but the family they mean is the Ford family.  Almost impossible to get out of the seating dept once you are in; they will not let people transfer to other depts within the company without a fight and a lot of made up unwritten rules that have to be followed first (ie you have to have a manager's permission to apply for intercompany roles).  Career growth is stagnant, typically supervisors are hired in from outside the company instead of from within.  Salaried engineer bonuses are always less than what UAW members get and continually less than what other comparable OEMs (FCA, GM) get.  OT is available but trying to get paid for your extra time is difficult and must be preapproved, rules for OT are heavily biased in favor of the company (ie you must work 11 hours before you can book 1 hour of OT).  If you decide to work at Ford in seats, insist on a min salary of $100k, you will need at least that much to offset the tons of unpaid OT you will have to work."

2017-02-09,3.0,"Product Development Engineer  As a mechanical engineer, there are a lot of interesting projects to work on, depending on your interest.  Training opportunities,  family friendly (depending on the supervisor)1) Sometimes difficult to move to a new job.2) Profit sharing is not competitive in the industry. As a nonsupervisory design engineer with more than 10 years experience, profit sharing will be approximately 6% or $6,000 based on 2016 profit of $10.4 Billion.  Using GM as a comparison, based on profit of $12.5 billion, a nonsupervisory design engineer will receive profit sharing of 1113% of base salary with a 165% multiplier or ~$23,500.   Hopefully Ford will improve compensation in the future."

2017-05-01,4.0,"An Evolving Company with a Positive Outlook It is a great feeling to see your ideas and work come alive on the pavement. I had originally stayed away from OEMs because I didn't feel that they had embraced technology fully enough, but I believe that Ford is making strides to become a technology company instep with its manufacturing past. Ford has an extremely positive outlook and will continue to become less susceptible to cyclical automotive changes as a mobility company. I am extremely excited for what the future is bringing.The vacation policy is really bad when compared to everyone else, and there's no flex time. Come on Ford, it's 2017! We're also forced to use our vacation over the July 4th week  how is that modern thinking?!?!Additionally, everything is done by the book which I believe to be a negative thing. Although there is a conscious effort to change this mentality and to become more agile, there is still a 'Day 2' mentality among many of the veterans as very few of them are thinking outside of the box, This is probably because very few employees have been exposed to many (or any) other work environments. Good thing? Bad thing? It's a doubleedged sword  people don't leave because Ford is a great place to be, but it also creates a closed system where ideas can't freely circulate. Lastly, I firmly believe that Ford can become more effective if there was not a fear of business tools. Yes, information is highly sensitive and we don't want information leaks, but Ford seems to hide from new and innovative approaches to managing data and encouraging efficiency. Leadership should push new initiatives for improving business efficiency."

Lots of benefits for sure.Hard labor, 'Seniority' mindset where people feel they deserve more not because they work the hardest and smartest but because they've been there longer.

Drab negative mindset is consistent throughout the plant. Not for everyone so if you get hired and don't like it, DON'T FORCE IT.

Less than 10 days is standard after signing and you will be expected to block them 6 months in advance. Management can and will cancel them any time they please.Hazardous working conditions. Was exposed to excessive heat, asbestos, sexual harassment, verbal harassment, unguarded dangerous machinery, etc on a near daily basis.Poor treatment by upper management. They do not care about your future at the company and will do next to nothing to advance your career. You will be prided only upon your ability to show up to work every day.

The management truly supports the whole individual and recognizes that life events can be more important than work. When I had to take time off to care for my ill husband, they were especially supportive and understanding. Then they worked with me when he went on hospice so that I could work from home 4 days a week and take advantage of intermittent FMLA.Management can be overly involved in the details of daytoday work, sometimes depriving workers from achieving their potential and contributing more."

You get to work with cuttingedge vehicle technology and shape the future of transportation.  There is huge emphasis placed on learning and development for employees.  There is plenty of opportunity for movement within different job roles if you want to keep developing and moving up in your career.  Management understands the need for work/life balance, and is understanding that we work to live, not the other way around.The company struggles to reward and compensate based on performance in nonmanagement positions.  The salary pay structure is antiquated and puts an emphasis on tenure, similar to a government job."

2017-10-26,1.0,"Consider another career path Good job security, until the next recession.  Adequate benefits.  Some departments have good work/life balance options, not all do.  Occasional profit sharing.  The range of different types of positions is very diverse.Good, competent managers who treat their people fairly and equally are EXTREMELY rare. You WILL be mistreated here, not every day, but it WILL happen and more than once.  Many managers mistreat their people and those around them.  Discrimination, insults, intimidation, bullying, undermining people's careers are all fair game.  HR does nothing about it, the higher the rank of the manager, the less they will care.  Most incidents go unreported because it's common knowledge that HR will do nothing and there WILL be retaliation in some form.  This company only cares about their public image and how that helps them make more money.  Deep down they don't care one bit about having a happy and productive work force, profits come first.  Management ignores constructive criticism and feedback from it's employees.  Most coworkers have the same complaints you do but are afraid to speak up and rightly so, dissent of any form is not tolerated.  It's like living George Orwell's ""1984"".  All office buildings are old, crumbling and moldy.  The UAW is a pain to deal with.  They have fewer responsibilities, few qualifications and get paid more than most educated engineers.  The pay here is not great.  Hard work is rarely recognized or rewarded.   Promotions are awarded based on popularity rather than performance or competence.  Profit sharing checks are capped no matter how much you contributed to help the company this year."

Also, Ford will assist you financially to get an MBA, which is awesome! Biggest pro in my book, though, is that everyone is so willing to assist you in the learning process.  Ford doesn't have the competitiveness that I've heard about in other companies where everyone is only in it for themselves. The One Ford plan really brings us all together to achieve results as a team.I feel like the travel budget is too small, so travelling that is further than an hour away is hard to get approved.

Enjoyable part of my job is working with good people, and the freedom I'm given to take care of business."

Rules changed everyday, they twisted them to what they wanted. It was not a good business.7 day work weeks, long hours, no breaks, rude staff. Low customer base which meant not to many customers would come in to buy cars. 8 hours could fo buy without a single person at your desk. The management bullied and degraded its salesmen, myself included. Ultimately shaved money from employees paychecks and would not give them what they were entitled to unless you fought them on it. And still you would not always get the money you should."
2017-11-12,3.0,"Ford really needs to move with the times... As a Ford employee, you are told you are part of the Ford family. It is a pretty decent working environment,  you do have a real worklife balance, it's not just lip service. Since I was hired as an experienced employee, I was given 3 weeks of vacation from the first day. There are a fair number of holidays and the week of Christmas holiday is pretty much an extra free week of vacation.Where do I start? Well, competitive pay and pay for performance isn't happening.  If Ford really wants to seriously contend as a mobility company and not another automotive manufacturer, it needs to seriously hire software engineers with real skill and experience, basically on the level of what a Google, Amazon, Netflix, or Facebook would hire and pay competitively with those companies. In fact, those software engineers will have to be probably better if they are going to hire for such things as Autonomous Vehicle, AI, and writing embedded software. Ford  management is still stuck in the assembly line mentality of hiring a bunch of lowskilled developers is better than a few really good ones and we can use project management, architecture,  and irrelevant bureaucracy and processes to achieve good outcomes. In fact, these outdated ways have been causing an untold number of unforced errors and have achieved little to nothing except mistrust from their business partners.  There has to be a complete tectonic shift in how the IT organization starts delivering software or Ford has no chance of competing in this arena."

Few other companies today match Ford's compensation package i.e. hourly pay, healthcare benefits, paid time off, and bonuses.  The workplace culture, however, is stifling at best.  There is very little opportunity for advancement or promotion for someone starting out on the plant floor.  Often times one's only option for getting a less physically-demanding job that utilizes one's skills and talent, is to go the UAW route, which is super cliquey.  As I mentioned, my experience has been that Ford (the company itself) does not promote from within, even for qualified employees.  Management often lack people skills, which perpetuates the rift between hourly and salary employees.  In general, the morale on the plant floor is low, which is the backbone of Ford's workplace culture."

The bonus program is based on a tiered scale and is available to all employees of the company.Too hierarchical, bureaucracy is a massive issue, a large  tenured work force that is incentivized by a pension program that creates a corporate culture of “go along to get along”, even if “getting along” means making ill informed decisions for the long term success of the company.

Ford doesn't want any one person to have too much power, so they reduce their risk by having everyone know the same technologies. The management struggles to grasp what 'young people want' and they move too slowly to attract or retain talent. The culture is very friendly and very family oriented - but it doesn't appeal to young people as a result.  It's very Office Space -esque. The most difficult part of my job was honestly finding meaningful and engaging work to accomplish.  There are certain projects which are pushed fully, and many times the 'fun' projects are outsourced or Ford acquires a company that already does it.   The best days at this job were the days when I was fully engaged in meaningful work, had a clear cut path of what I was to accomplish, and worked with people that made it fun.

There has been a heavy focus on commonality and waste reduction and recently has been a push for complexity reduction. The management at Ford makes Ford a desire to work at and the job security is very strong.  Ford has recently shown a commitment to changing the culture that was at some of it's plants and seems to have a zero tolerance policy for harassment which is reassuring. Thoroughly enjoy working for Ford and could not imagine finding a better company to work for."

2018-04-08,1.0,"Nice Pay, Terrible Work Environment!!! The health insurance benefits for Union members is excellent and you don't have to pay for it.Supervisors are very disrespectful. You break your body down, because you're basically operating like a machine. Sexual harassment towards women is VERY real and it's disturbing. During the Summer it's usually about 20 degrees hotter inside the plant than outside. The job pays well, but you work for every penny. When you factor in how much pain you're in after each shift, it makes you second guess going, but the weekly paychecks bring you back. If you get injured on the job they treat you poorly and try to say the injury didn't occur there. Carpal tunnel is very common in this line of work and it is VERY painful. The medical staff is a joke and will always send you back to the line. They'd probably send a corpse back to the line if they could get away with it."

Or if you are in a team setting then the team leader takes the good work from the rest of the team get paid good while the other team members do not.  Ended up worked weekends (7days in a row) to get a paycheck to pay bills.

2018-07-02,1.0,"BEWARE-Never give advance notice if you plan to leave I had a great supervisor and team.   They paid my relocation costs when I first started work for them.I left Ford when I was recruited into a better job offer, plain and simple.  I planned to give 3 weeks notice as a courtesy to my team that I still highly respected so I could help them transition a new team member into my position during a very busy time in the project cycle.  Beware, the day you give notice they immediately excuse you from work and cut you off no matter what date you list in your resignation letter.  It seems they have a secret walk out policy.  Don't bother giving notice until you're ready to leave the same day.  I lost thousands and thousands of dollars in retirement money that would have vested in just a week had they honored a 2 weeks notice.  I was promised two weeks additional pay and unused vacation in my exit interview and a month later I haven't received anything and have been trying for over two weeks to reach someone and find out what happened.  They send you to an email address that only responds every 45 days, and knows nothing. The person who gave me the promise never returned any of my calls until my wife called then emailed and referred me to the same phone number that knows nothing, well actually pretends to know nothing as I’ve called them enough now to get the feeling their responses are scripted.  They give a pretense of helping me and answering my questions but we are still back at square one after over two weeks and I’ve had to rephrase my question about ten times and they still don’t get it.  Ford touts how good they are at communicating but anytime I try to call and get information, no one knows anything (or maybe pretends not to) and I'm just referred to automated email addresses and voicemails.  Even as an employee we found out major company news from the mainstream news before they told their employees.  Horrible communication.  You can't find contact information anywhere to a live voice, probably on purpose.  I wanted to leave in a friendly manner but instead they seem to have made false promises and treated me like outsider scum so I've lost all respect I had for them which is really sad.  Thanks a lot Ford, it didn't have to be this way.  If you plan on staying there the rest of your life then maybe you'll enjoy it if you can handle all the lack of productivity and frustration that might arise when trying to work with union employees and if you don’t mind a bonus that seems to be only a fifth the size of what the union workers get, but if you ever have to make a career change, watch out for the Corporate beast and be sure to make sure all your own interests are in line before you leave.   Yes I’m bitter now, I’ve wasted so much time trying to get only what was promised to me and I wasn’t bitter when I walked in to give my notice or even when they walked me out the door although I was shocked. The last month of trying to work with completely clueless and incompetent Ford employees, policies and procedures has ruined it for me, zero customer service, and intentional avoidance. I’d be ashamed to drive a vehicle produced by a company run in such a manner and I can’t believe I worked for such a company, how sad."

Advancement is not based on how well you perform, work ethic, leadership attributes, metrics, or individual promise. Advancement is chosen either by having a relationship connection or sucking up to the right person at the right time. If you’re not selected they dangle a carrot in front of your face saying you’ll get it next time like your 3rd grade soccer coach. FMCC has put all their apples into an FCLDP program to encourage young college grads with relation to Michigan or Ford to become the future leaders of the company. They develop these employees for 2-3 years then they leave and make twice the money elsewhere (good on you). Instead FMCC would be better off advancing those who have a desire to work and develop to provide fresh ideas, actual leadership qualities, and can make a difference in the future of the company... but that will never happen. FMCC is stuck in the dark ages with software from the 80’s and managers who dont know how to use microsoft products. But they’re content in their ways and will continue to prosper until there’s another economic recession and they lay off 50% of the company again. Great people work for this company for decades and gain nothing in return but an email congradulating them on their service and retirement. If you’re looking for a job to clock in clock out, pay your bills and retire sign-up. If you have any aspirations to make a difference, turn the other cheek."

It would have lasted longer but, once I went to college, the manager didn't want to work around my schedule and instead gave me some made up useless job of calling customers that recently had vehicles worked on to see if they were satisfied.

2018-09-11,2.0,"Working at Ford Motor Company as a Process Coach is very stressful. Process Coaches have the worst job in the plant. If you came from an outside company, its even worse. You have no time to learn your job or everything thats required to do your job. Management expects you to know how to do things that you never heard of until they mention it for the first time. Machines are outdated and when they go down, It's your fault. You constantly get yelled at by 6 to 10 people for things you can't control. Working with union workers at Ford is awful. No regulated heat or air. Forced to work on off days. If workers don't come to work they are punished and if too many come your forced to get as many out as possible even if they don't want to leave. It is just Cut throat!!!"

2018-09-12,5.0,"Great company to work for. High job security. Most Management genuinely cares about its employees. New projects and jobs keep it fresh. Lots of different career paths. Ford is highly regarded as a place to train/gain experience. Many people get recruited for higher paying jobs after a few years. If you have a good boss you can put the work in and advance quickly. Very smart, hardworking coworkers. Pay is good (not great) but you get a lot of side benefits.Very flexible work environment. Savings & stock matching is generous. Products are cool and interesting  Ford will have the best overall vehicle lineup in 3 years. Lots of regional offices across the country. Dearborn is ok, the surrounding areas in Ann Arbor, Plymouth, Canton, Birmingham and downtown Detroit are actually very nice places to live and commute from.Base pay is usually slightly lower than other OEMs. Health care is stupidly expensive (but that’s the case anywhere in the USA). If you have a bad boss they can stall your career. Management will often overpromise and underdeliver  ex: “tell us what you’d like your next position to be and we’ll support you.” 3 months later: “here’s a completely different job from the one you asked for, but we think you’ll like it too.”Company has a PR problem with explaining its plans. Will often add significantly more responsibility without adding compensation. Talented people get picked off by higher paying companies because Ford is tight with the purse strings."

2018-10-02,4.0,"Senior Financial Analyst I don't believe in reviewing a work experience until you've had some time to put your experience in context.  I worked for 6 years as a Financial Analyst at Ford, and I had unparalleled professional development at that time.  The Finance function at Ford is one of the best in the world with decades of refined processes for budgeting and preparing business plans.  There is a strong emphasis on the management team of providing analyst level employees with challenging assignments and high standards of work product and professionalism.  Equally important is the emphasis on honesty and integrity, and I was never asked to modify any numbers in order to hit predetermined targets.   The skills I learned in Ford Finance are highly transferable, and continue to make me a better Finance professional today.Ford is full of talented individuals, and there are not enough management positions to develop of the great talent they recruit each year.  In order to distinguish oneself for promotion, one has to be willing to accept special projects, work long hours, and prove their loyalty to one's boss.  Once I left Ford, I confirmed what I had already expected; that Ford's talent pool is so good that they're expectations for promotion are out of line with the rest of the manufacturing sector.  A surplus of talent is a good problem for Ford, but can feel stifling for talented up and coming professionals."

Much of the office equipment (chairs, tables, etc) at the plants, especially at Sterling Axle and Van Dyke, are filthy, dirty, broken, and unkept.  Just an embarrassment to look at.  My chair literally had what looked like poop stains on it!After you quit, 8 months later you get a letter stating they ""made an accounting error"" and claim they overpaid you and want some money back.  Shady as hell.  I won't buy another Ford again, just lost a good employee and customer."

If you need to stay in Michigan it is one of the better places to work.Ford IT wants to believe it has transformed to a tech startup company.  Delusional thinking.  Red tape is everywhere.  Innovation is more often penalized than rewarded.Much of IT Leadership are too narrow minded to see innovation potential. Punitive leadership leads to fear based decision making.IT teams hide information from each other and sabotage each other.Management set in their draconian ways.  Large contingent of IT managers should not be allowed to manage people.  If these IT Managers treated dogs like they do their people they would constantly bitten.  It is almost impossible to change jobs  internal posting are mostly just to check a box and say they advertised the opening  when they already have someone selected.  Constant political battles between managers make it very difficult to change to a jobs.Your manager will most likely have zero interest in your career.   I have yet to have a manager who asked me what my career goals are.Unfortunately, If you establish yourself as a dedicated, talented employee, you will be stuck doing repetitive work and soon hate your job. The more established you get, the more time you'll spend in endless meetings, which results in ever poorer worklife balance as you end up doing most of your real work after hours. Since most IT managers are technically incompetent you'll spend more time explaining and selling your work than doing it.If you forget to pay homage to the old boys club, you will never get assigned interesting work or a promotion. The office space is horrible. FMCC is filthy, dark and moldy. The renovations to open offices are a waste of money.    ITHQ BIC is awful  the new open office plan is atrocious.  It is impossible to get work done, even with blinders and earplugs.   The leadership keeps slapping themselves on the back and rolling the horrendous open office plan out to more and more buildings.The IT infrastructure is nearly always broken, but somehow is reported as 99.9% available.  The newer infrastructure is always failing, servers down, databases down, Hadoop unavailable or the data in bad state.  This makes difficult to test and deploy code as you must wait for availability.The reliable IT infrastructure technologies are being abandoned because they are not bright and shiny.  A lot of technology for technology sake.  Attempt to move everything to Pivotal Cloud Foundry with little thought of what business value is being provided.  Meetings are like a tent revival, where everyone is making the trek down the aisle to be converted to the Cloud.  Praise be, we had 30 conversions today."

2018-12-17,3.0,"Only take the job if you like to sit around do nothing and get paid well I was an Engineer (electric vehicles related)Very competitive benefits (base salary, vacations) in autoindustryExtremely relaxed work environment (with the exception of some teams, most people work a couple of hours a day and call it good)Employee discounts on Ford vehiclesTo most extent, very nice and easygoing colleaguesJim Hackett and executive team realizes Ford's troubles ('clock' speed, efficiency) but have not done much to change things, especially at middle management levelJoin Ford if this is your only offer. If you are young and looking for a job to do your best work, grow skills, and build a career, then walk away. I chose Ford over multiple FANG offers and I wish I had a timemachine. You have been warned! If you stay too long your skills won’t be marketable. In my interviews, I was explicitly told that the pace of things at the new company would be very different (read fast) from Ford.Performance reviews are a joke. You copy your generic goals from the startofyear to the comments section. Supervisors do not even meet to discuss your career or to give any feedback on what you can do better.Red tape. Every single technical decision goes to layers of supervisors and managers and it never goes to technical experts. I noticed that even the most hard working people spent most of their time getting approvals from managers instead of working with technical experts to make great products.To make matters worse, middle management does not value people for their technical skills. you can come with a bachelors/masters/phd or spend 10 years working at Ford, there are very few managers who will appreciate you for your skills. Most employees (at GSR level) are considered soldiers in an army; the managers only care about the quantity of soldiers, not who they are or what they bring to the table. Makes it very easy to stay underradar if you don't like to work. Becomes very hard to do any work if you want to progress in career.I copied this from another review since it described supervisors very well. ""Since well over half the people do no work, supervisors keep adding staff saying they need more resources to get work done.""Good luck using your personal business days. At least my supervisor made sure that he knows exactly what you are going to do and for how long so that you can come to work for the remaining hours. One of my colleagues used his vacation days to attend an event for professional training because that was the only way."

2019-03-27,3.0,"Great Co-Workers, difficult position. The manager of the customer service dept. was fantastic. A very approachable, understanding & outgoing person. didn't feel like a traditional ""boss"". Most, if not all of the staff in the other departments were very nice too.The money is good, for a customer service position.The position itself is very difficult, being spoken to in an aggressive, rude & insulting manner every day undoubtedly has a negative affect on a person. There was little to no room for upward mobility, there didn't seem to be any option to move up the ranks. If there had been, I could have seen myself sticking out the job for another while, in order to move up. But that doesn't seem like a great way for Ford to hire the best people.Upper management are stuck in the stone age in certain ways. Having to start from the bottom and do a job you hate for years, in order to get a position that is relevant to your degree/field doesn't make any sense. It's more a test of your patience, rather than your proficiency to do the given job. Some people in upper management are there simply because they've worked there for X number of years. Seems backwards. Also, a small thing but does sitting at a desk answering phones all day really require someone to wear a tie? Come on, reprimanding people for not wearing their tie in a job that isn't client facing? Get real."

2019-05-30,2.0,"Things have gone downhill Work/life balance is mostly good but varies by area.The culture has spiraled down into something toxic in the last few years.  I've been there 5 years and the ""one Ford"" culture from Alan Mulally is all but gone.  At all levels, fiefdoms have been created.  The company's outward messaging is that they're a technology company.  This is far from the truth.  Upper management has promoted talking about great ideas and not implementing them.  They have wasted countless millions/billions on worthless acquisitions only so they can say ""look how techy we are"", when in reality, we don't even know how to make money on cars anymore, much less high tech sectors like autonomous vehicles or mobility ventures.  Pretty soon I expect the bubble to pop (it already has to some extent with the onset of layoffs).  This company has lost its way.  If you're looking for a ""tech"" job, look elsewhere, because you will only be disappointed.  On top of that, comp and growth is poor.  Employees with other job prospects are jumping ship at the first opportunity.  Don't get suckered by the brand name, you'll only be disappointed."

They bring in more people from HQ (also politically driven) with the same corporate mindset rather than Silicon Valley mindset.   With the latest restructuring, the R&A department got rid of a noticeable portion of their skilled Silicon Valley hires and kept all the corporate folks from HQ.

Biggest negative is I know a lot of my friends did not have a good internship because they didnt receive ample amount of work. Biggest advice is to make sure you are constantly asking for work/if your projects scope is small, be open with your supervisor and the people you work with to make sure you will have enough to do. I worked in a division that I now know I dont see myself working in in the future, but I met some great people and my supervisor was super willing to help me get in contact with people in other divisions. Since Ford is such a big company, there are so many resources and people to reach out to and set up connections with. I am very thankful for my intern experience and I think Ford's name looks really good on a resume. Your experiece will depend on how open and willing you are to throw yourself into any project or work people hand you."

2019-07-31,4.0,"Loved working here but very hit or miss The people at Ford are the main reason I would ever consider coming back. Such a big company means there is sometimes a bureaucratic barrier you hit, but it wasnt a huge deal as an intern. Biggest negative is I know a lot of my friends did not have a good internship because they didnt receive ample amount of work. Biggest advice is to make sure you are constantly asking for work/if your projects scope is small, be open with your supervisor and the people you work with to make sure you will have enough to do. I worked in a division that I now know I dont see myself working in in the future, but I met some great people and my supervisor was super willing to help me get in contact with people in other divisions. Since Ford is such a big company, there are so many resources and people to reach out to and set up connections with. I am very thankful for my intern experience and I think Ford's name looks really good on a resume. Your experiece will depend on how open and willing you are to throw yourself into any project or work people hand you."

The work is challenging and you never stop learning.  Also, the people are unequaled and the compensation is fantastic. I always felt empowered to make local tactical decisions. There definitely is a wonderful family feel that starts with Bill Ford. The history of the company is also inspiring and fascination.   The problem is upper management starting at the Chief level.  They  change their minds constantly and  start most programs late, usually without adequate staffing. To top it off they have layers of people tracking your every move. They often minimize bad news and prioritize timing and cost over quality.  It's a yes man culture with draconian bureaucratic requirements.  Over the years the trackers, the paperwork and the uncertainty have taken the fun out of working there.  They fritter away billions by proceeding with troubled programs then relentlessly hound the workers to save a  nickel. Process ""improvement"" trumps product work.  Management has no conception of what it takes to do the job right and often doesn't really care. They run the business using staffing models that have no connection with reality and the way the company is run.   They pump resources into autonomy and electrification at the expense of current products and forward model even though I've never seen a coherent customer  ""why buy"" for  electric cars.

2019-09-30,2.0,"Be careful if you work here. There is interesting and challenging work here if you are fortunate to get into the right department. Company policy requires you to stay 1824 months in a role even if it is not a good fit for you so take that into account. If you are young or a new grad, the company has some decent benefits for parental leave, new parents, etc.Main focus is on new graduates or those with 03 years experience. If you are older with an established career, you will get sidelined and ignored here. Very little actual career development opportunities, you will be told to go and watch videos at your desk. Never more than one week of training provided per year and the burden for approval is huge...forget meaningful conference and seminar opportunities. Compensation increases are very difficult and typically consist of 23% paid out to everyone once per year regardless of any other parameters. This is known as ""merit increase"" at Ford.  Toxic, no trust environment. CYA at all times!! After hiring, the goal is on financial reporting to management, there is little or no engineering integrity. The company does not produce, it assembles. All vehicle components, hardware, software, etc are sourced out to suppliers based on requirements. Lowest bidder wins. Engineering at this company simply means writing requirements for supplier bids and verifying that the requirements have been met. Project managers and financial bean counters have veto power, not engineers.  The company is also technologically backward...even critical operations and decisions are handled by emailing spreadsheets back and forth. No major corporate ERP system is in place and used throughout the company.  Huge question marks around future tech such as autonomous as most of that (if not all) has been farmed out to other companies."

They will not rock the boat or make any decision that will impact their employment and thus their pension. They do not know how to manage employee conflicts, or request for work assistance. Their standard approach is: be quiet or it goes in your performance review.2) Coworkers will openly insult you in meetings, call you stupid/idiot if you do not agree with their strategy or question their engineering approach.3) Most of my coworkers are very bitter because they feel they haven't been given their due promotion or salary increase. So they will refuse to help any newer coworker or put in any extra effort that involves work outside of their assigned project or causes them to put a few minutes outside of 8 hrs a day. Else they demand that their assigned project deadline be delayed or they get paid overtime, even if they are salaried. So they will basically ask you to reinvent the wheel unless they are compensated. 4) Ford employees who have been around for a while are very good at making look like they do work, when in reality they are just good at coming up with a million obstacles about why something cant be done. The incompetent supervisor, since he/she doesnt know enough, will just go along and buy the excuse. Then employee will spend most of the time on the internet or talk about NFL."

This is a very micro managed place of work, if youre off the phones for 2 minutes because youre doing other work (work your team lead told you to do) you will get hunted down and told to get back on the phones and the same goes for restroom breaks. Another thing is you could possibly be unvoluntarily scheduled for saturday OT meaning you work 6 days out of the week. Another thing that was sort of a nuisance is your schedule can change up to 3 times a week although youre given a set schedule...This is what can make working here very draining.

You become a dot on a ranking matrix rather than just get helpful feedback and advice. Honestly it was pretty dehumanizing and the culture was pretty cutthroat. I was pressured into starting my masters degree in engineering because everyone else was doing it, and I hated it  which made me feel less than worthy.  It also felt like all the jobs I was given were worthless projects and busywork, I never felt like I had the ability to make a contribution to the company.

Corporate vision and strategy is difficult to digest. I am not exactly sure how ""Ford Mobility"" will become profitable and our new ""truths"" are vague and difficult to apply to every day facets of our jobs. CEO, although nice, seems disconnected and scattered.It is difficult to tangibly see your impact in the company.

And know, that you'll only have to prod them 3 times to get what they promised you.This will completely depend on your group, but mainly your supervisor. Your group is your program, NOT your commodity. Ford is completely oriented towards making a vehicle fit together, NOT making each component work the best. This is supposed to cause the different commodities to come together but it rarely does. It also causes repeated mistakes to happen. So you'll see the same issues on multiple programs because the same commodity engineers don't talk with each other that often.Also, products are moving so quickly, by the time an issue is detected, another program has it already in the pipeline. Issues are caused by lack of communication between the different engineers of the same commodity AND when specs change in one group that cause issues in another.There are so many supervisors that seem like lost workers. They have no idea what they are doing or how they got into their position. Even though they have a dozen people reporting to them, they will also be releasing parts and are too busy to BE a boss, or especially, a leader. Because of that, you will be on your own. Fend for yourself, most people will not try to help you on your issues. Rarely, yes, someone will, a bit, but that's rare.So many reporting systems!!! The same 5 pieces of information will need to be reported 90 times a month. Redundant work takes up 2/3 of your engineering time. Management implicitly favors this work rather than making sure everything else is complete."

2020-08-27,3.0,"Not the Job for Everyone Good pay, good benefits, yearly raises, centrally located by airport. Great support programs and reps to get you in touch with community services you might need. Free (but very limited/discounted) legal services plan. They pay for your health, dental, and vision insurance. FORD employees are given priority for intake at The Brook Hospital. They pay for college tuition, I think it's $6k per year, possibly per semester. The union can fight for you to keep your job in most instances, along with getting your termination reversed in many cases as well, of course, depending on what rules you broke. There is air conditioning in break rooms, restrooms, offices; and working fans at most every work station. There's a medical dept in the plant with nurses and a doctor for work related injuries or illnesses that occur while on the job. They also have a physical therapy dept on site for those who are prescribed pt to try and help minimize damage from repetitive motion injuries. You go to medical/physical therapy during your shift (while still getting paid) as someone covers your job for you to do so. There's fun union activities at the union hall/out in the community for your family. Holiday parties, trunkortreat, employee appreciation picnics, etc. If you surround yourself with the right people, you can create a great support system/community/extended family for you and your family.Very strange factory ""culture"". Tons of negativity, gossip, drugs, harassment, favoritism, manipulation, and taking advantage of people. You're best to go to work, not socialize with most, and head home straight after. This isn't all there is of course, but it's overwhelmingly THE culture there. They've only been hiring temps the past few years, not hiring them fulltime for years. You only know the max length of your shift, but time varies daily and you don't know what time your shift ends until after halfway through your shift each day. People take advantage (on a whole other level) of any and every loophole they can find, in every single policy resulting in VERY divided and bitter coworkers and regular policy change to try to combat these issues. You have to save your vacation time to use during shut down bc each year. The parking lots are huge and you must get to work very early in order to park, walk through the turnstiles, and inside the building to wherever your specific job may be. There are security guards in the lots but there's still quite a bit of vandalism, theft, and just plain ""working hazard"" damage done to vehicles by people dropping screws and other things in the parking lots. Lots of flat tires for sure. Open drug/alcohol abuse in parking lots on breaks and in between shifts, so it's a difficult place for many to remain sober (without a very good plan ahead of time.) I imagine most factories of this size all having similar issues, but this is the only one I've worked at so I've got nothing to compare it to other than what I've heard from others. There's no a/c, but there is heat for a couple months in mid winter. It's a very loud environment, and an extremely monotonous and boring job that begins breaking your body down fairly early on with all the repetition. The pay is so high because they understand what you're giving up when you work there. You're ultimately trading your quality of life for a higher paycheck and better benefits, but by the time you make it to retirement your body is going to be hurting so much you won't be able to enjoy things as you would've if you'd worked elsewhere. That being said, you'll have the money to do things you wouldn't have been able to if you'd worked elsewhere. Figure out your priority, health or money; it's definitely a tradeoff there. I honestly don't believe there's a way to have both if you work there your entire career. Possibly switching jobs frequently to limit repetitive motion injuries, staying ahead of probable injuries and taking extremely good care of your body, and finding ways to take time off through the year to give your body a much needed break to recuperate are the only ideas I can come up with that might help reach that goal of trying to have both."

Management are expected to understand your work instead of simply performing 'project management' task, and engineers are virtually always encouraged to say and do the right things.

If the customer isn't completely satisfied with a part of the sales process, Ford takes 10% of whatever you made for the month. This includes ANYTHING, even if it wasn't your fault. The surveys are rated on a scale of 15 (5 being the best) and you need to have a score of 4.85 or above to not be deducted 10%. I once had a coworker that got around $700 deducted simply because the customer wasn't given cold water and wrote that in their survey; singlehandedly dropping his average below 4.85."

I’m only speaking in regards to Sterling Heights axle plant. Management is terrible you have to actually get into a fight with a team leader before anyone do anything situation. I never worked for a company that you have to complain about a team leader who also have dozen other complaints before they do something. They don’t even try to pull each individual to solve the issue nor do they move anyone. The company is good to work if your worried about what type of benefits you will have in the near future. But I will not recommend working at Sterling Heights axle plant to anyone.

Due to the history of the dealership we had , for the most part, very cool customers that are understanding, and if problems arose, we had the power/ability to resolve/ satisfy most all customers. Mostly all employees were mature and did their share of the work assigned, thankfully ,very few of those kidadults. Very supportive management/coworkers.Due to the amount of work our job consists of and also the accountability, there was hardly any time to have rapport with customers that we enjoyed helping. 7a6p (latest I stayed there was til 9p , but came in on the weekend(Sat) to finish up some leftover paperwork.

The role consults multiple businesses that generate millions in revenue, which allows you the opportunity to develop an incredible set of skills that are trasferrable. A vehicle is provided, which is a bonus that negates the personal financial impact of keeping and maintaining a vehicle.Regional offices vary greatly based on the leadership team, some score lower in terms of DEI and have higher turnover. These offices can feel very isolated from HQ initiatives, programs, resources, and oversight. There is very little room for salary negotiation and employees are often compensated far below market value. You will be offered many opportunities with little finanical compensation.

Advancement is extremely difficult because most people above you want to stay where they are at because they want to get their 30 years, get their pension, retire and come back contract “double dip”. Most people don’t want to advance because the workload at upper levels is not worth the pay. Change jobs within the company is almost impossible since your manager must approve you to go apply.

Just admin/paperwork. Internal spreadsheets/tracking sheets/analysing costs endlessly leaves no time to engineer.D&R role impossible to escape internally. Transfers are not outright rejected, but they say you need to find your own replacement for your job (knowing full well that no one will ever volunteer to go into D&R role).Blame culture throughout, particularly between budget stripped departments who fight each other like dogs to earn the praise of the overlords in Finance.Moral at rock bottom.
