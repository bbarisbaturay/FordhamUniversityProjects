It's an organization that rewards politeness and being a ""good guy.""Very little infusion of new ideas.  Soldiers, not innovators, are promoted.  There are very few good managers of people, but a lot of people who are very good at managing up.  The Japanese parent company is a bureaucratic nightmare and can suck the life out of any simple request.  The eternal struggle will be manufacturing versus sales.  Lip service is given to production flexibility.  If they could all they would sell are Tundras and Sequoias.  We have to BEG to get more Priuses.  Personnel problems are, in a perfect world, swept under the rug.  It can take years for the company to build the courage to terminate anyone."
2008-09-22,3.0,A good place to to gain valuble experience in a manufacturing environment. It is a well recognized company that can really help a resume.  They are pioneers in justintime production and quality systems.  These are sought out by many employers.  You can be confident in job security there have been no layoffs at the Georgetown assembly plant since it opened in the late 80's.Very few opportunities for advancement within the company.  Many of the top leadership are from GM or other big 3 orginizations.  Management in most cases refuse to address poor performance within the saaried work ranks  work is split to the high performers.  Poor communication between parent company and US transplant making certain tasks frustrating
2008-09-30,3.0,"Not too bad. Supposed work/life balance.  You are generally not in fear of losing your job.Career advancement difficult, due to people staying in their jobs for years."
2008-10-03,3.0,"A fair place to be. Great experience about the car industry. Many great spiffs for selling alot in a month, great bonuses and great people to work with. Many people come and go but if you stay and make good with management you have a chance to get up, or catch a raise.Very difficult to get time off in the service department, difficult to move up or get a raise. Long hours, sometimes you need to work on Saturdays or holidays. Holidays are not overtime pay. Very high pressure to sell service work, you are questioned about why your performance may be low for the month."
2008-10-16,2.0,"High expectations, mediocre rewards. Stability and very good company reputation.Extremely demanding of employees.  If you are in favor with management, the upside potential is tremendous.  If you fall out of favor, it's a very long road back.  The rewards are not in line with the expectations."
2008-10-23,3.0,"An Over rated Place to Work! Looks good on resume! Learn how to problem solve. You get a decent discount on cars. Get to work on big projects involving lots of cost. Get to see just in time production. Learn how to visual presentations to cater to an international atmosphere. Lots of opportunities to travel with go and see.Japanese Mindset. Location and growth are poor. They treat you like robots. They don't want you to anything at work that isnt work related, even if it helps get you though the day. As cost saving inititative haulted all travel and forbid worker from listening to music while at work."
2008-11-20,5.0,"Toyota is a great place to work for. It is a company that understand employees, and believed in continious improvement. The salary and the benefits are excellent!!! And everybody has the opportunity to advance with the company.The is some supervisors (OL) that do not have the full knowledge of how the system work. Sometime we ask them a question and they take weeks sometimes months to come with the answer."
2008-12-27,2.0,"TEMA has some serious culture issues it needs to fix. The car industry is an exciting place to work  and Toyota arguably is one of the best at it.  Toyota invented the JIT system, and you get to learn it from the experts.  Looks great on a resume  and you get a pretty good discount on Lexus/Toyota/Scion cars as well.  The daily work can be really interesting  depending on your manager, and the specific role you walk into.  Best thing to do is work here for 12 years, then leverage this into a better opportunity elsewhere.Culture.  Management is severely disconnected, pay is barely adequate, hours are long, etc."
2009-01-04,1.0,"Not the best place to work Pay, Job Security, safe work locationHours, expectations, lack of accountability, week management control of suppliers"
2009-01-07,4.0,"Toyota is a good, fair employer. It's a very good company that treats its employees well, and does its bet to be fair in all situations.  The company has high moral standards and its actions reflect that.Sometimes long hours, very competitive environment, high expectations from the company."
2009-01-07,2.0,"If you're looking value stability over opportunities for advancement, this is the company for you. TMMK is Toyota's largest North American plant and can be an excellent place to gain experience in high speed manufacturing.  The pay is often above average and Toyota is well respected global company.  Toyota is also known for being highly selective and just being hired by them is a plus on your resume.Few opportunities for advancement exist.   While I was there, they hired almost exclusively through temporary services and I personally worked with other temps who had be there for up to 7 years.  For nearly 3 years, they hired no one at all.  I can say with almost absolute certainty if you are hired as a temporary, you have almost no chance of becoming fulltime.  If you are able to survive the hiring process which includes working a minimum of 2 years as a temp with no benefits what so ever or days off other than plant shut downs to get hired, you'll have to start over at the bottom of the seniority ladder.  Keep in mind that vacation time is assigned by clock number and TMMK has over 6,000 employees.  In other words, you wouldn't get first pick of a day off for nearly a decade if then.TMMK's senior management seemed disconnected and on occasion unprofessional.  I can recall several meetings with senior management in which managers stopped the meeting to take cell phone callsoften personal ones.  Many long time employees lamented the departure of the Japanese management.  Most said the current management was out of touch and uncommunicative."

2009-01-22,4.0,"Great Pay, Good Hours, Great upper Management, Great Company. Great satisfaction in your product.Great Pay and benefits.Toyota cares for their employees.Great Communication between upper management and Team Members.Location.At times, work life balance can be a concern."
2009-02-03,4.0,"The Toyota Way is mostly the Right Way. The spread of Knowledge and the extensive learning of the Toyota Way.  You are taught about lean manufacturing and the importance of cost savings.  By working for Toyota you are expanding the number of other companies that are interested in hiring you.  Other companies want to hire you based on your experience within Toyota, it pays off!  Very friendly people that work hard together to get the task at hand done.  Toyota is leading the way for future vehicles, including many high mpg cars in their new lineup.  They understand where the automotive industry is going and working hard to be the leader.Because of the continuous improvement scheme they have, it is often times very frustrating to get work done.  So many people need to see your paper work and sign off on it that it may take days for this process to happen.  Day to day work seems boring and the same, this of course depends on what department you work in.  Since the company is Japanese owned you will have Japanese managers.  This poses several problems including communication issues.  You will have to learn to understand japanish speak very quickly.  Moving up in the company seems slow, but then again I have not had much experience."
2009-02-20,2.0,"Great plant but has a lot of growing up to do. Great nonexempt workforce.  Never had a more satisfying experience than working with the T/M's that build the product.Toyota as a whole is built on good fundamentals and the experience is challenging.This is the second Toyota Manufacturing Plant I have worked at.  Regarding TMMI, I feel the exempt culture at this plant is missshaped compared to other Toyota facilities working the Toyota Way.I notice that the relationship between Managers/A.M.s and Specialists is quite heavyhanded if not adversarial at times.  This is really evident in their H.R. policies which are very conservative compared to other plants and lack any definition or flexibility.  H.R. policies at this plant are applied very inconsistently.Leadership communication is usually one way and very top down.  TMMI middle managers are very perception driven and I see terrific opportunities wasted because of politics and narrow focus.  Again not typical of other Toyota plants.  I see rush to judgement and reaction that is often not thought through.  This only serves to tear down the stability of the processes and not strengthen them.This plant has an excellent professional workforce but I see the Specialists often spun in every direction with little opportunity to give their work the time required to do it right with a lasting contribution. Very high expectations placed on Specialists here with very few rewards.On the whole, this plant has it's priorities straight on the floor and builds good product but in the office culture has a lot of growing left to do.  I see this management team having benefited from years of good sales and not really knowing if what they did all these years served the better purpose or not."
2009-02-21,5.0,"Times are tough.... but it could be so much worse in these tough economic times we've all seen changes and cut backs... but, Toyota is the only major corporation that I've noticed (especially automotive) that the executives are taking cuts in their compensation packages... they don't expect just the little guys to take the brunt of the tough times... we truly are a team!it's like a small town in itself... and along with small towns, there are both good and bad aspects.  But, everyone knows everyone and that's not always good!"
2009-02-23,3.0,"Mediocre TMMI offers great benefits, however when I first started the company all health benefits at no cost. Then they started charging a small amount and have since raised the amount a little more. The benefits are great and cover most expenses. Toyota as a company has a great track record for high job security. They just recently offered the 2nd buyout offer since Toyota has been in the US.Currently there is a global hiring freeze and little to no chance of advancement. This is very discouraging when you had hopes of moving up the corporate ladder. I would also recommend senior management to lead more by example. Less meetings and more face time with the team members."
2009-04-15,4.0,"Toyota: A Good Place to Work The people that work for Toyota Motor Sales are great people who care about their colleagues.  Working for Toyota Motor Sales has shown me what a true team is: people that look out for each other.  Toyota Motor Sales has great benefits, and the company is designed to help an associate with a family.  Actual salary may not be as high as you would expect, but the benefits and work  life balance more than make up for it.As with most Corporations, there are politics in several decisions of which can affect your career.  If you are a single individual, the benefits are great, but you cannot fully utilize them without dependents.  Salary is not as high as you would expect from a major corporation, and without dependents to fully utilize the benefits, it may not be as compensating of a job as a single individual is looking for."
2009-04-16,2.0,"Great product and overall company, bad local direction. Toyota makes a great product that you can be proud to sell.  They have a lot of ongoing education on Toyota products and have regular handson trainings where you learn a lot about new products and features.  There were many trips to LA to testdrive new vehicles and a requirement to complete numerous online training classes that were very well written and provided a lot of information.Toyota doesn't have much markup so the pay isn't fantastic.  The management and environment at the dealership was horrible.  You can't trust anyone to help you or be on your side.  The managers and owner are no exception.  The company itself is good, but locally it is horrible."
2009-05-13,3.0,"Not a bad place to be - easy work for decent pay Nobody works that hard, hours are 95, and you get every other Friday off.  The pay is reasonable for how little effort people there put into their work.Change/Progress moves very slowly, Japanese/Toyota Way often used as an excuse for accomplishing nothing and taking forever to make a change.  Can be frustrating if you like to, you know, make a difference or accomplish anything."
2009-08-01,1.0,"Worst job of my life You can be sure your check will not bounce and you will get paid on time. That's about the only thing I can think of. If you work as a contractor for Toyota, you will be harrassed and discriminated by supervisors and in a more subtle way, by management. Once you become a team member, you can be as lazy and unprofessional as you want. As long as you are a team member, Toyota never fires you. If you make some mistake or do something wrong all you get is a slap on the hand. Therefore it's a great place to work long term if you are unskilled and have no ambitions, because you will have a job guaranteed for life, regardless of how many mistakes you make. Management is not flexible at all, and they don't have the slightest clue of how everyday problems are solved. I saw how team members who worked, say, in human resources were offered key positions in, say, production (or some other completely unrelated area) even if they did not have the skills. On the other hand, contractors who had the skills for filling an open position were never offered the chance to become team members  the golden elite who can never get fired . If you are creative, or want to grow or do things in a different way (even if it reduces costs and is more efficient), forget it. At Toyota everything is done ""by the book"". The problem is some of their procedures are already obsolete."
2009-08-24,4.0,"TMMWV Some of the best reasons to work there are the quality of people at Toyota, attention to detail and respect for each person.Working in West Virginia, like a lot of auto companies they are building plants in the middle of no where which can be a pain to drive an hour from a small city. I would probably still be working there if the plant was in a more desirable location or I didn't have children in school right now. I would have rather taken a job in Georgetown, Ky a much nicer location."
2009-10-01,5.0,"Wonderful company to co-op with, awesome co-workers, great environment. Management was wonderful and all specialists within our group were extremely helpful.  They gave me responsibilities of a full time employee, even though I was a coop, which included various projects and assignments.It was difficult to request time off because of work assignments that had to be completed during certain times of the month.  Some days, when we travel during the day, you may be away from home for 12 hours."

2010-08-10,3.0,"Use to be a better place to work, but still not bad compared to other automotive mfg's. Stable, solid, dependable background of keeping employees.  Very little hiring/firing once you are inside (However, this is also a detriment  see below).  Toyota has been much more stable over the years compared to GM, Ford, or Chrysler certainly.  Toyota has equivalent or better benefits in comparison to other automotive oe's.Employees (called ""Associates) are treated with respect, and typically granted a lot of leeway provided they are producers.Great facilities  nice campus, great food, credit union and other services.Top management has lost it's way.  Toyota is not necessarily a big ship clearly headed in the right direction under strong leadership as in the past.  A substantial amount of current leadership really got to their positions via politicking and positioning themselves by making powerful friends more than actually being the most skilled and knowledgeable.  That is starting to show.  The problem is worse at individual department manager leadership, where Toyota tends to shift management in frequently (every 23 years) from not very closely related areas (again based on chummy favoritism over skill set) that aren't experts in the product and therefore tend to be listless/feckless leaders.  Toyota clearly should do more promoting from within departments.  Subject matter experts abound, but they are used as ""nice tools"" until they realize they aren't going to be promoted over the politically savvy but technically weak  and they leave.  Toyota has suffered from a talent drain over the past 10 years and it appears to be gaining momemtum  a bad sign for the company.  Basically, top management seems to think good managers come from reading books on management and attending seminars and applying the general management theories they learn.  It's not working.  They need to retain and promote people truly interested and knowledgeable in their product and their market  and push the sappy generalists to the side.As I mentioned,  there is a talent drain from Toyota  however it remains a good, solid company to work for to pull down a decent salary.  Therefore, a lot of nonperformers never leave.  And, Toyota seems to be very soft in dealing with them.  Every department is filled with about 25% ""post office mentality"" people that feel they deserve a job at Toyota, have a general distrust of management, and are more concerned about their benefits on a daily basis than performance on their job.  IN fact, many seem more apt to argue and bicker and push away responsibility.  They are not punished for this behavior.  In fact, the general feeling among nonmanagers is ""work hard, be better, or not....you will get the same steady average raise"".  Toyota needs to change that fast."

High turnoverI worked at TEMA for 13 years, from the late 1990s through 2011 (in the purchasing division).  During that time, control of major strategic and tactical decisions had been gradually transferred to an American management team that was recruited as new college graduates during the mid to late1990s. Under this management team, morale and work satisfaction plummeted. Turnover also rose to alarmingly high levels (this despite an unemployment rate over 10%). Inexperienced, insular managementMost of TEMA's senior management team is under 40 years old, and most have never worked anywhere but TEMA. The company was able to thrive despite this liability during the boom years. However, since the crash of 2008, TEMA's managers have been stretched to perform beyond their experience and capabilities. This has resulted in an arbitrary, often paranoid work environment.

2013-03-29,4.0,"A great place to spend a career.  For the motivated employee, can easily move your way through the company and gain tremendous experience in relatively little time.   Plenty of lateral moves between departments, to keep things fresh and challenging.  Amazing benefits including car allowance or lease options, health care for entire family, 401K, pension, etc. Once you're in, you're in! Very hierarchical which results in traditional decisionmaking happening at the top and behind closed doors.  Can be frustrating to feel shut out of the discussions. Company doesn't do a good job of addressing poor performers, so as time goes on motivated employees either leave or grow lazy Promotions are few and far between Overreliance on outside vendors & consultants to make up for the skills gap of longtime employees"

2013-05-19,3.0,Great Pay! But the job will take over your life! Great pay and benefits! Best pay I've had w/ no degree! Tons of overtime! If your single and never want a family this jobs for you! Low cost on health benefits.There are a ton of personalities and selfish agendas to deal with. If you dont have a lot of ambition stay a team member. Shifting sucks! The older you get the worse it is imho! Plant is water cooled so in the summer time get ready to sweat!  I know people there that have been transferred to less physical jobs because they been run into the ground{Assembly).  Carpal tunnel seem to be the main issue with most people hurt! This is a MGMT problem. Best advice is BE YOUR OWN HEALTH ADVOCATE!!!

A significant amount of the business is through repeat and referral customers. The Toyota brand is #1 in the industry for quality, value and reliability.

2013-09-22,4.0,Major Let down This company was purchased by a Venezuelan family and it had been procured with all of the bells and whistles. The owner has replaced all of the Upper Management in each department and has replaced their loyal and hard workers with cheaper laborers who are struggling to stay above water. There is no raises only empty promises of advancements and raises. When I was hired there was one positive to the company that was quickly removed they did pay for the medical insurance out right but that is a thing of the past. Some of the best managers I ever had the pleasure of working for were fired and replaced with moles within the company all a part of the venezuelan regime. The employees moral is beaten badly and the constant policy changes threaten the very core of each individuals desire to make this a life long career.

2013-09-23,5.0,"A great company to work for who values its team members' safety! Though the work days, at times, can be quite long, they are very exciting and unique. Each day yields new challenges, and team members are involved in process improvement ideas. The culture is that of safety first and quality second. Respect for people is what you will find not only in the management areas, but also out on the shop floor. Advancement opportunities are available for all team members who express interest in moving up in the company and who can demonstrate proven leadership abilities. The company is big on team building activities on both company and department levels. The most difficult part of the job is working on the assembly line, as doing repetitious work can be hard on the body. The lines operate on production, so the work day ends when the production number is met, or until the next shift begins. For that reason, the work day hours can be very inconsistent and overtime is normal and accepted. Team members are recognized regularly for improvement ideas in the areas of safety, quality, production, and costs. Toyota is an awesome employer."

2014-04-01,4.0,Selling cars can make you alot of money but I cared more about the customer than I did profit. I had never done sales before.  I worked 12 hr days and was off mostly 1 day a week.  I realized I had sold my family life for a career in the car business and that wasn't healthy.
2014-04-01,4.0,"Fierce Competition. The most important things I learned at Toyota were the ability to negotiate and how to pick up on customer nuances.  Selling automobiles is one of the most difficult sales you'll ever make so to do it well, repeatedly, makes a way for your selling muscles to flex.Not doing well and getting blown out for lack of production.  Being intimidated by others in the sales force.  Not making enough money to pay your bills because you have yet to succeed as being a closer."
2014-04-02,4.0,"Fun place to work with free coffee. A typical day at work would be scanning invoices into the computer, taking appointments and taking payments from customers from services done on their vehicle. I have learned how to communicate better with the public and resolve any issues a customer has. The management is very professional. The Service Director is very understanding and takes care of his employees. The hardest part of the job is when the service department gets really busy and i have to multi-task. The most enjoyable part of being a cashier at Toyota is that the employees there are like family to me. We all make our workday a fun and memorable one!"

The company lease is a great benefit too.They say they care about the work/life balance, but if that was the case they would think more about the employees as family and not as numbers or as something that can be tossed w/the trash.

They send their associates to technical training courses, seminars and career building events such as VMWorld, and pay for everything. They don't skimp on the computers or anything else in the environment. From the time you set foot on the campus, you can see quality in everything they do. It was an honor to work there as an associate.They are a bit old school, and aren't open to innovations like telecommuting. When i was there I could have done 99% of my job from home, but they always told me that they are a car company, and they want people driving their company lease cars to work so they can see their smiling faces every day. Their senior management also tends not to be very technically astute, and are easily swayed by chummy vendors into mandating less than optimal technology choices."

When the company really needed to watch it's budget they started taking away basic associate morale events and it was hard to watch people get discouraged by that. I took it upon myself to keep up morale by doing what I could selling custom apparel and setting up department lunch functions and it was appreciated. Enjoyable part was the special project I enjoy a challenge and problem solving I was called upon by the President, VP and HR to help with events on many occasions. Also enjoyed working with my friends.  Work is work and if you have great people and are appreciated you can't really ask for more than that in a job"

Associates are diverse in ethnicity, education, goals, expectations, etc. Bonuses, 9/80 work time, lease car(s), health benefits, free fitness center at HQ, raises.The ""Peter Principle""  many associates have been promoted to management positions which are beyond their ability to manage people and/or projects. This causes a huge black hole in project approvals, direction, budget, etc. Lack of people skills causes undue and unnecessary slowdowns in productivity."

The company is also moving to Dallas,  so morale is down and people are looking for ways out."

Culture of respect for people and continuous improvement is diligently practiced.  Great opportunity to learn about Japanese culture as well and work directly with parent company, TMC.  Pension plan and lease program (esp. manager's lease allowance) are great.  Networking opportunities abound.Too much bureaucracy, slow in decisions (consensusdriven), growth opportunities are slow and often dependent on headcount instead of pure merit.  Leadership can be like an old boys' club, lacking progressiveness in trying new approaches to work and work place solutions.  IT is often dated.  Lots of dead weight at the company."

I enjoy trouble shooting situations and trying to find a resolution. The most difficult part of this job is the tension in the office.  My opinion is that the staff has poor management skills. If you need to scream and belittle people, you have lost control of the situation already and confirm your inability to do so.

The culture at Toyota is very friendly and Toyota hires mostly qualified and intelligent people.Managers in many cases don't hold poor performers accountable while simultaneously not rewarding high performers for picking up the slack. There are a lot of people going through the motions and are strictly there to collect a paycheck. Management and some associates are sometimes resistant to change which discourages outofthebox thinking and innovation.

Not for the technically hungry engineer. *In the production engineer's role there are many facets of manufacturing essentials that are learned. *Diverse experience can be gained related to manufacturing of automobiles if you are self driven. No one will stop you from doing positive activities related to many different vehicle aspects.*If you are proficient, you will become self managed with very little supervision making how and when you work your choice (still must keep core hours)* Management does not always know the Toyota job way due to be hired in from other US auto companies.* Workload is significant for those who are hungry and want to make progress. However, the non self starters are paid similarly (sometimes more, time based system) and are perceived to have a much more manageable stress levels. *Performance evaluation is a flawed system designed to keep underachievers and overachievers in a narrow performance bracket, which does not represent the actual condition many times.*Work life balance is skewed towards work. Depending on project cycle weekends do not exist and 7080 hour weeks are normal. (not a con if what you are working towards is motivating)*Technical ability is slowly retracted from your engineering mindset and replaced with project management."

Results are good, but utilizing a great process to get results is best. The focus on process helps to develop long term skills and long term results. Motivated individuals fit best. Very diverse company. Lots of opportunity for travel if that's what you enjoy. There are also lots of opportunity for lateral movement within the company if you have interests in other functions/jobs.

If you require formal training and step by step guidance (unless you work in production), you won't find much at TEMA. Onthejob training is the usual approach.

2015-06-11,1.0,"Get head out of sand Are there any pros left?  I suppose the next couple of years they are still in California is  last 'Pro'I hope a lot of 'Team Members' are reading this..1.  TMS does not want ANY Band 2 employees to go to Plano.  This is evidenced by the low relocation package being offered.  Band 2 level employees are considered 'unskilled' workers.  The band 2 employees are paid A LOT of money compared to the same jobs at other companies in LA.  TMS knows they can fill these positions in Plano and pay 60 % less.  The reality:  it will hit TMS like a ton of bricks  there are SO many Band 2 positions that SHOULD be Band 3 positions.. There are associates that have been in their job for 1520 years and the job has evolved into a highly skilled job.. Band 2's will fight to have their job changed to a band 3 but TMS won't budge. They use the excuse that you need a BA to be promoted to a Band 3...  This is a ridiculous argument... Some people were not able to go back to However they know the job better than anyone...  I have seen band 2s retire after 30 years with the company and they have changed that person's job to a Band 3 position.. They would NEVER promote a band 2 (someone in the dept) instead they would hire someone outside the company...  Unreal.   But it doesn't matter now.. They are doing their best to get rid of Band 2s.. But will be shocked to find out how much skill many Band 2s have...  They will be shocked to find out how difficult it is to find people with degrees in the DalSorry Band 2s.. You're gend of the stick.  Ask for a 'buy out' NOW.. They will DO it.  I know this for a fact!!  TMS is just using you..  They want the 'perfect' scenario until they move to Texas.. They want ALL associates to STAY to the end so they can move the operation... Then I am amused to see SO many people JUMP ship in the last year.... I see departments STRUGGLING to keep afloat.  They are having a difficult time hiring people  as you know it takes FOREVER to hire 1 person.. Now they have to hire MANY people.. They just don't have 34 months to hire 1 person anymore.  That's their problem.  Senior management has had their head in the sand thinking that everyone would stay until they end.  Maybe if their weren't so many MEAN and HORRIBLE managers out there these associates may have stayed loyal until the end...  Senior management has no idea how many inept, mean, horrible band 4s and band 5s are in the organization.  Human resources knows how many bad managers are out there! They are the ones who hear the complaints  but HR has So now you have many people leaving the company.... Now there is an imbalance in the departments... In some cases Band 2s are doing 3 jobs  2 of those jobs are band 3 jobs.  It seems it is OK for band 2s to DO the work of Band 3s but not be promoted or given the $$ that they should get.  Obviously this proves that you don't always need a BA to do a job...  Believe me I can easily get a BA 'online' from some substandard school and it has NOTHING TO do with the current job I'm doing.Band 2s  ask for a BUYOUT and MOVE on!2. The other group that TMS wants to get rid of is Band 4 managers  these guys are WAY OVER PAID...  I know many many managers who are making over $140,000.00   That's because they have been with the company 25 plus years.. They get HUGE bonus (15k20k)..  They have HUGE pensions...   Band 4s  are expensive... And as we all know (especially the band 2 and band 3s) they don't do a lot.  They are not in the daily production, they aren't doing the 'work'.  When a Band 4 goes on vacation for 3 weeks no one notices... When a Band 2 or 3 goes on vacation for a WEEK  EVERYONE notices!!   TMS doesn't need Band 4s.  They want to get rid of the HUGE payroll liability.   Band 5s can handle the 'managing' of the departments until TMS hires band 4s in Plano for a fraction of the salary that these band 4s were making in Torrance..  So long Band 4s....3.  The ONE group that TMS needs is the Band 3 group.  These associates are actually paid a little less than the market in LA and have great credentials.   I have many friends are TMS who are CPAs with their MBA from big schools like USC.  They could be making MORE money at Sony or a Downtown firm  but wanted the lifestyle at TMS.. So Toyota has been very very lucky in attracting these amazing people.... But these people had no idea that TMS would move to Texas.  These over qualified Band 3a do NOT need to go to Texas.  They are highly sought after employees in the LA market.   TMS needs these highly skilled associates to go to Texas..  They need them to keep the business running.  They are perfect for TMS  they aren't hugely overpaid like Band 4s.. They have big credentials (unlike band 2s) and they do most of the skilled work.  THIS is the group that TMS needs to keep the business running in Texas  and they are getting the most attractive relo package of all"

2015-06-18,5.0,"Toyota of Puyallup is a great business I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Toyota. Before I was a lube technician I was a service valet that required driving and cleaning customer vehicles. As a lube technician I changed oil and rotated tires most commonly for the work orders. I learned how to work well and get along with a decent sized team. Not everyone is always pleasant to work with, but not allowing that to effect your own work was a learning experience. The management was nice and mostly considerate. There demands were always reasonable, nothing outrageous or strange. My team members were the best part of the job, but other co-workers from the different sub departments were sometimes challenging to work with. I believe that was due to a difference in priorities and motivation. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable both fall on the team members. At times it would feel like a group of guys hanging out, joking around. At other times it felt like a competition where everyone is only looking out for themselves."

2015-06-29,3.0,"Good-Value Company but Slow and Outdated Work Environment Good values company that wants to do right by its customers, employees and suppliers/vendor partners. Most of my coworkers are quite friendly and the environment can be laid back/relaxing. Interesting industry with dynamic challengesTMS has set up a cushy worklife balance with decent benefits, so people just don't quit & move on  this has resulted in very little ability to move up (lots of lateral movements instead). Pay is relatively low and more junior staff are not necessarily given the trust to carry projects forward on their own. Consensusdriven culture means it takes forever to get decisions approved or initiatives executed and it can be frustratingly bureaucratic.The culture has fostered lifers for so long that many at the company do not know what work environments are like at other companies. The way the company operates on a daytoday basis, the kind of technology it utilizes, etc. can seem fairly outdated/backwards on many occasions."

2015-07-07,5.0,"Toyota is a fantastic place to work A typical day at TFS begins with a review of task that require immediate attention either because of the previous evenings incidents or problems causing business impact.  A review is conducted with the SME's in my team to ensure the root cause is identified and a fix is either implemented or will be implemented in the immediate future.  Then I immerse myself into projects, planning and implementations. At TFS I have learned that there is no one individual to blame for any events that adversely affect the business.  There is however a sense of Kaizen, continuous improvement.  Improvement in processes, training, and systems.  This is engrained in the management and their employees from beginning.  Collaboration is key.  There is a sense of teamwork without competition. Management at TFS can be perceived as being slow to react but they seem to make decisions for the long run and not a knee jerk reaction to short term issues.  This can be the hardest part of the job as well.  One needs patience.  Even when one is perceived as being not fit for a position, TFS takes the time to invest in their people. The most enjoyable part of the job is not the work itself the what other opportunities the TFS offers.  It offers great work life balance, great healthcare and really nice gym and swimming pool at the work place.  People seem to thrive at TFS."

It's one of the most indemand jobs in the state and once you're fulltime, you're made until you want to leave or retire. The work is hard, but you get used to it and your body builds tolerance to the wear and tear you have.Temp agency only sees you as a number and don't care about your life outside of work and whether or not it'll influence your work. They have a zero tolerance absence policy, which they don't let you know at orientation. They give you the impression that you can use PTO time and that if you're circumstances are dire, you'll be given leniency. You won't be. You'll be given your PTO time, then afterward, you're fired no matter what the reason behind it is. They even denied my unemployment and when I appealed, they had to acknowledge that their attendance policy wasn't what they said it was. Also, management wants numbers to be where they need to be no matter how it's done. You'll be micromanaged, but that's the name of the game with Toyota.

Employer for those trying to quickly gain managerial experience  as long as one does not prove incompetence to peers  it is very easy to fast track to managerial positions.  The Kentucky plant is of great surrounding areas for the young and families. Most positions outside of assembly are not very challenging/stressful if that is your intent. Also Very Safe and clean facilities  Top tier safety culture.Majority of employed engineers are only used as advanced problem solvers in the sense of only applying basic common logic to a problem. Most jobs aren't inspiring in my opinion. Short of the Die design and Stamping Equipment group the Japanese keep all technical knowledge, work, positions and training in Japan.Also there exists a very negative culture of the majority of workers & technicians loathing engineers and any interaction with them (even the ones they deem competent)."

2015-11-12,5.0,This was a great place to wrok and learn how to work as a team to accomplish common goals. I worked for this company for 11 years and in that time learned a lot about working together to complete a goal.  This company focused on standardized work which helped me adapt to changing environments and team work.  They offered great benefits and had fair time off.  I enjoyed working here for as long as I did.  On a typical day our team would meet with the Team Leaders and they would provide the production goal for the day.  Through that day we would set hourly goals to make sure we were on target for the day.  This was a production company so hitting our target was very important.  The hardest part about the job was the extra overtime that was issued when production was consistently not met.  It was hard to work 10 hours a day then have to come in on a Saturday and work another 8 hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the amount of people I got to meet.  The company employed about 600 employees and in my department I was able to meet a large amount of that overall number.  It was fun to talk with people from different countries and of a different age.  I learned something from many of them and some I still consider good friends.

As far as Texas goes, it really seems to have something to offer everyone.  For families and those looking for more suburb type areas, there are places like Frisco, Plano, McKinney, and more.  If you/re looking for more of the urban scene, there are great areas like Uptown and Addison.  I'm very happy to have made the move and continue my job with Toyota.Toyota is a very lean company, so overtime is required a lot of the time, but we are compensated for it, which is great."

After all work orders are filled, we delegate our routes and collaborate with our sister dealership on shared duties to ensure no redundancy.  The tenure here has broadened my knowledge of automobiles and the auto industry at large, as well as dealing with efficiency with logistics. Management is very hands-on, interacting with myself and the other drivers to ensure we as representatives of a auto parts vendor understand our role.  Co-workers are largely cooperative, in the parts department specifically communication is strong.

2016-07-09,4.0,"Good ol' Toyota I worked at Toyota for about 7 years.  It's changing, and mostly not for the better.  Toyota was kinda like working in a government job/old boys club.  Promotions were few and far between, and mostly based on seniority or politics.  It was rare that the right people got the bump up.  Plus there is a bias towards people that come from the field offices (which is kinda like the military - you do as you're told, move around a lot, and eventually get promoted).  Management is clueless and put in positions where they have no experience, so a lot of departments are faced with having no guidance or direction.  This causes confusion and in-fighting.However, Toyota always had a level of respect for their people that made it a nice place to work.  People would stay a long time, so you all had to get along.

2016-09-30,1.0,"A mere shadow of what it used to be Paycheck shows up every two weeks.  Financial stability.All the things that used to make Toyota (and Lexus) fantastic and so much better to work than any other car company are systematically being dismantled under the guise of ""harmonizing"" all the various Toyota companies into one.  Over the last few years (but currently on a more accelerated pace) there have been multiple downgrades in pay, benefits and company perks to where it's no different than Ford or Chevy.   Congratulations Toyota, you've successfully benchmarked mediocrity.  From forcing all associates to agree to arbitration in HR legal matters to loss of pension, loss of health insurance options, etc., and now they are hinting at coming drastic changes to the average pay scale for various positions, meaning I will not receive another raise for the next 10 years.  As I said, it's no different than working anywhere else now.  Once prized, our customer's are now just a sales statistic for the marketing team to pat each other on the back about."

A typical day in metal repair at TMMI is basically team members just trying their best to maintain excellent quality while not truly knowing what the quality standards are. This is due to the fact that management is constantly changing their minds on what is ""good"" and what is ""no good"" when it comes to certain defects. TMMI definitely needs to come up with a quality standard that is followed plant wide instead of shop to shop because this causes much confusion that could be very easily avoided. This has been brought to the attention of my immediate supervisor and I was told, by my supervisor, that they do in fact have a plant wide quality standard, but no one follows it. The metal repair group is a small group of 10 people out of a total of 4000+ employees. Avoid quality related jobs at all costs."

Consequently, there are not as many customers coming in the door as there should be. Commissions are all just mini’s and real bonuses don’t start until you sell 12 cars/ mo  which many salespeople fail to reach. The majority of new car sales are made exclusively by just two teams, the Brazilian team and the Toyota employees team, but you can’t touch their customers.  The other salespeople are left to try and make their quota selling the comparatively few walk ins that come in. Incredibly, they keep hiring more salespeople yet I think they need LESS so the current ones have a better chance at selling 12 cars per month. I was told they are running a 200 % turnover rate among salespeople and I believe it. Training was poor because the instructor spent most of his time selling cars for himself instead of teaching us. Management leads by intimidation and feels if you don’t have enough customers it’s YOUR fault and YOU are to blame. They don’t even have enough desks for everyone and you have to share one with three other salesmen making it hard to do business at times. So be forewarned: if you think you can sell enough cars to make a living by only relying on just the walk ins know that others have already tried this and failed."

They love to say there are a ton of opportunites for advancement when you first start. That is false. This place is a dead end job. As a sales person, you can make good money if you're good at selling cars and can definitely live off of that. I will not specify my past position due to wanting to stay anonymous, but this dealership and the managers do not care whatsoever about their employees. All they care about is MONEY. If you don't make this company $25K+ a month, they cut you. Their expectations are always WAY too high to reach. Secondly, let's speak raises. Haha maybe it's better if we don't. Asking for a raise in this place is seriously a joke to them. They have never been willing to pay their employees what they deserve, even if they are hard working employees. They look at everyone as they are replaceable. Thats why there is such a high turn over rate in employees at this dealership. If you're looking to make a career out of something here, I honestly don't recommend this place. If you're looking for a job where they will never reward you for your hard efforts and barely even recognize you as an employee, you've found the right place.

The entire time, We were standing in a loud warehouse without hearing protection, and with almost no climate control. The workplace culture that exists makes it clear that Toyota does not care about the employees there at all. My friend and I started at the same time, and he was promptly let go after missing a day of work due to a car accident he was involved in. The pay is miserable, as Toyota starts off everyone at 9.50 an hour. The work is mind numbing and repetitive. You WILL be performing the same tasks  repeatedly for 12 plus hours a day, with 2 15 min breaks and 1 30 min lunch break. Attendance is taken immediately following lunch, to make sure everyone arrives on time, meaning you have to be at your work muster station LITERALLY within 30 seconds of your lunch/break ending, or you will be reprimanded. Everyone is miserable there, and I have witnessed more than a few temp employees breakdown crying due to the harsh treatment by some of the full time Toyota supervisors  Additionally, Toyota has the WORST restrooms I have ever seen. They were constantly out of order, and the few that were working properly were filthy. The soap is never refilled, lighting that works when it wants to, EXTREMELY inadequate ventilation for the amount of people who were expected to use the facilities. However, I would like to thank Toyota for one thing. It was due to my horrible experience at the Toyota campus that I decided to go back to college to finish my degree. No one"

2017-03-18,1.0,Dealer review Used to be a good place to work but as of late time cuts and lack of pay raises are the normal.  They only think of employees as a number and not as a team.  If you are not part of the club you don't receive the benefits.  The reason so many people leave and have left is the way they treat employees I believe ownership needs to change . It starts at the top and works it's way down but sometimes it gets pushed back Good luck Toyota!!

We then gathered our necessary paper work and tools for processing our line calls from all the departments in the plant. I learned diversity,the importance of safety, quality control, teamwork, problem solving, and that the next process was your next customer. Management assured all team members  that their input was welcomed and encouraged. The hardest part of our job was getting our bodies conditioned to assembly line work. The most enjoyable part of our job was the ability  to train or transfer to different jobs. The continuous model changes every year kept exciting and fulfilling."

My experience has been positive overall. Toyota does a great job of preventing HR issues from arising within management, which can be a huge source of stress at other employers. Company culture is good with room for improvement. Toyota is very conservative with project investment. There's not much interest in R&D or anything that doesn't have an immediate and well-understood ROI. That can be frustrating for those who want to try something more cutting-edge. That said, for those who love incremental change, Toyota's kaizen methods are for you. I've had multiple opportunities to affect change in both a production and pre-production environment. It's immensely satisfying to see people using a tool you've made or running a process you've designed. Benefits and compensation are very competitive. I've had an overall good experience working at Toyota."

2017-06-20,4.0,Customer service I worked for Alorica which had a Toyota account for the customer service. I handled providing information about recalls potentially effecting customers' vehicles. I have learned a lot about recalls and customer service in general at the job. The management was excellent; they would provide follow ups with the reps weekly and give an overall assessment for the month. At work we would generally clock in and receive inbound calls. Hardest part of the job was when a new recall hit and we would have to gather the info provided on it and deal with the customers swiftly (Which got easier with time). The most enjoyable part... Eh for a time I had my own cubicle: that was cool.

With the company going through a transitional time with the move to Plano, there is much opportunity to grow and develop your skill sets across the company.  Senior Management is extremely knowledgeable and open to helping the new generation of employees grow and learn more about the automotive industry.  Highly recommend this company.  I moved all the way from sunny LA to Dallas for this job and the career potential.  So far, no regrets.  Also, the new campus in Plano is incredible.  State of the art everything!Sometimes the job can get cushy.  Not everyone is motivated to grow so you run into complacency.   Attractive to some, but uninspiring at times."

2017-07-26,5.0,"You make your own future Goodhearted intelligent people. Sincere attention towards stakeholders and the impact our decisions will have on them. Incredible worklife balance that is frankly unheard of among my colleagues at other companies. Outstanding (and REAL) commitment to community through donations, volunteer events etc. If you are strategic about your future and willing to network effectively, you can put yourself on the path to promotion.The consensus culture is good and it's bad. It can slow down projects and sometimes too much time is spent in strategizing/conceptualizing as opposed to DOING something. There are many ""lifers"" who are clearly too comfortable in their job and don't have a lot of drive to execute. Working on projects with such people can be a drag. Nothing is handed to you  if you simply expect to be promoted because you have experience you will be disappointed. This is a very large organization within which there are high, low, no and negativegrowth areas. You need to put yourself into position to be promoted. If you need to move departments, you need to network or you will languish."

I was involved in interesting projects, and enjoyed the work I was doing.  The last year there, the department focus changed, my job description changed, and my job satisfaction plummeted.Toyota underpays their engineers pretty much across the board.  I took a significant pay cut to come there, and it was only partially made up for by the very good (not excellent) benefits.There is little recourse if you're not happy with your current work.  I told multiple managers many times what I enjoyed doing, versus what I was not interested in doing, and didn't feel like I was being heard.If you get a bad manager, woe be to you.  You will have little recourse, other than transferring to another department, or quitting.  The HR department is basically useless, and the people there are changed like socks. So even if you educate them on a situation, they won't be around long enough to do anything about it or help you out."

I didn't think much of it then but did I find out. It was my first full time job, I took a semester off college, but the atmosphere was so childish and high school like. It was really condescending during training, like being a receptionist was some kind of elite position. Management also expected you to know multiple things when they did not provide the training to do such things. In the short time I was there I made one friend among my coworkers, the only kind person working there. Everyone else gossiped, were elitist, and not really that nice. I was terminated with no reasoning, and I had no idea why, I had never had any warnings and been told I was doing anything wrong."

Dealership doesn’t offer direct deposit and when payday comes, checks are distributed late and sometimes after working hours. Untrained under qualified management doesn’t know how to handle situations professionally. Management holds a double standard when it come to treatment of employees who are more qualified than others. Some of the service technicians have an “I’m better than you” attitude and act like they own the place. The work environment sucks, most special service tools are missing because they were stolen by previous or current employees, most of the equipment is broken or worn out, and the management doesn’t care. Do yourself a favor and seek employment elsewhere."

You will lose most of your friends because they will become tired of asking you to visit and you saying I can't because I have to work or I worked last night so I need to sleep. Your family will receive the worst because you will take out your irritability on them because of only getting 4 or 5 hrs of sleep that day and your son only wants to play catch. I have never worked at a place where you constantly see people out with major health issues, mostly heart problems or cancer. There was a man who died from a heart attack on the floor of the plant. Terrible! The rotating shift is not working, extremely high turn over rate and unable to attract truly skilled workers in production and maintenance. They won't admit it's not working and are to proud to admit they are wrong in changing it to a fixed shift. They do pay well and have good benefits, but you will be like me, trapped in the money and giving up a happy existence for money. I wish I never put in an application for Toyota.

When I worked at Toyota I was a student in college (still am). I worked part-time there. My overall experience at Toyota was actually horrible. Management is completely full of it, and they are all out for themselves. I have worked with management in previous internships after Toyota, and culture was COMPLETELY different. I have heard too often stories where so called group leaders threw their own employees under the bus in order to get ahead. Leadership lacks, along with a positive work environment. People talk about each other, and are hateful. I kept quiet, and ignored comments from negative people like ""you're going to stay here for the rest of your life"". People in the HR department need to be replaced, because they cannot do their job. Although pay sounds good, it isn't worth it for how you are treated. Demoralized and only seen as a tool for building the vehicle for the money."

2018-03-29,2.0,"Toyota offers little room for growth All of the people who are rating TMMK as wonderful and great are obviously brainwashed by the pay and complacency with doing a low-skill job. When I worked at Toyota I was a student in college (still am). I worked part-time there. My overall experience at Toyota was actually horrible. Management is completely full of it, and they are all out for themselves. I have worked with management in previous internships after Toyota, and culture was COMPLETELY different. I have heard too often stories where so called group leaders threw their own employees under the bus in order to get ahead. Leadership lacks, along with a positive work environment. People talk about each other, and are hateful. I kept quiet, and ignored comments from negative people like ""you're going to stay here for the rest of your life"". People in the HR department need to be replaced, because they cannot do their job. Although pay sounds good, it isn't worth it for how you are treated. Demoralized and only seen as a tool for building the vehicle for the money."

The last thing i do before i enter my own time and leave is to do one last walk of the line to ensure everything is set up for the next shift coming in.What i've learned while here at Toyota is how to problem solve and how important finding the root cause of a problem is.The hardest part of the job ( and its not really hard ), but sometimes its hard to get everything done that you feel you need to get done because sometimes you cant find enough time in the day.

Big, successful company, pays pretty well, pretty good benefits.Management tends to stick their heads in the sand and pretend they don't see all the issues and problems in their group. They are very resistant to any type of change (even though a lot of changes and improvements needs to be made)  they just want everything to be done exactly the same way it was done several years or a decade ago. There are a lot of office politics, fighting, and gossipping  neither managers nor employees don't really support each other here or try to throw each other under the bus frequently too. Also a lot of people didn't really know what they were doing in their jobs, so not the most competent people I worked with."

With excellence comes a culture of winning which creates an extremely desirable place to work. The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was winning based on productivity and profitability every month!!"

Finally trying to implement SAP.Lip service paid to being One Toyota.  At least in accounting and finance it is the old TMS guard running the show and imposing their way of doing things. When openings become available, if it is a department run by certain TEMA executives the jobs are posted and interviews are performed before position is filled.  In areas that are run by old TMS executive hand picked people are placed in open potions based on who they know rather then what they know.  Also it appears that there is a desire to have most SR Managers come from Old TMS guard rather then promoting individuals from TEMA.  Other differences are in how jobs were developed, TEMA developed jobs base on manufacturing lean process that assumes a minimum work week is 45 hours whereas old TMS jobs were designed to be completed in a 40 hour work week.  Implementing SAP by trying to replicate old manual processes and treating it as a replacement of PeopleSoft system that is basically used as a GL system rather then implementing SAP as a fully integrate ERP system.  To mean seams like a waste of $$$$$$.  Either implement right and fix issues rather than trying to show horn in broken processes just because “...it’s the way it’s always been done.”Company states that they are all about the people, yet their action show they are more worried about profit level. Case in point currently facing major budget cuts because North America wasn’t as profitable in FY18 as in previous years.  This is funny that they explain away the fact that Toyota as a whole showed profit growth over the same period, and explain it as mostly related to FX.  Guess what this is normally what causes the most fluctuation in international company’s profits and most of the time these companies are happy when it is positive rather then trying to spin it as doom and gloom."

2018-07-09,1.0,"Disrespectful expereice an otherwise  decent Corporation Nice pay as a contractor, not much for benefits as expected under a contract company. Work was as expected and with chances to get into project management though it was slim chance and getting on as a fulltime employee.Leadership is nonexistent nor helpful. I sought out feedback periodically and always told, ""don't worry, you are doing fine, we take things very slow, have patience"",  no problem for me. The office is extremely cliquish. Never felt comfortable by management or most staff. Some coworkers were helpful that was the only bright spot, most were inexperienced college grads who believe they know everything, I tried my best to provide mentoring for CAD software of which they knew little to no avail. I was told in my interview we find your strengths and build upon them....that statement was a joke as I look back. I strive to be a professional at my job, since I could not get work and projects assigned very often. I created my own as there was plenty of voids to be filled. Getting back to management, I read a survey when I started and attended a meeting to review the results. Some comments from other employees stood out prominently, ""How did you become a manager with the very little experience"" or ""Were you good at your previous job, maybe you should consider going back to it"". I took those as cynical comments, but they do have merit for who made them. Both managers I worked for sporadically communicated on what to work on which shows poor communication skills. Being new to this environment I was given reassurance of being sent to training  to pick up on a CAD package and being told to get cost for training. After getting cost, I was then told to plan to learn under another contractor who knew the software well. That was a mistake since this person was not willing to train or teach since they saw this as a threat to their job (verified by two other office employees on their poor training/teaching abilities)."

2018-07-30,5.0,"Fantastic, reliable, and progressive company! After 10.5 years at Toyota, I've had 4+ different managers and every one of the has been fantastic. Kind, easy to talk to, knowledgeable and willing to help.  Diverse and understanding work environment with a focus on safety for everyone. Work life balance is top notch. Flexible in/out times and flexible on personal time if you have something that needs attention outside of work. Toyota also does a great job looking out for their employees! No one was fired during the market downturn a while back, benefits that we had to give up for a while have slowly made their way back. Overtime is paid, which is unheard of for engineers. I wouldn't have left if I didn't have to!Late night meetings are normal (12 times per week) due to the need to meet with our counterparts in Japan. But management realizes this is a little unfair so will often only require attendance if there is a direct need for you to be there. There is also sometimes a language and/or cultural barrier that can make work difficult but it's not that difficult to get used to and is often better than the environment you'll face at other companies. Annual pay raise isn't great, but I think that's typical. Need a promotion for a decent bump. They also did change their promotion process recently that makes it a bit more difficult to get promotions since they have to open up and be interviewed for as if they were a new position in the company. However, this may have an impact on normal pay raises in a positive way in that they may be more merit based. I wasn't around long enough after the policy change to confirm."

It seems like management and human resources don't have the power or the freedom to use their personal discretion when making decisions.

2018-08-21,5.0,"ford f150 I bought this XLT with the 3.5L ecoboost to replace a 2015 with the 2.7L with 63,000 miles on it. I needed more towing capacity, and this truck delivers. I never expected to get better highway mileage than the previous truck, but it consistently does that. The front seats are much more comfortable than the 2015, the rear seats need some help in that department still."

2018-08-22,3.0,"Toyota is a great place to work if you want to retire....not if you want to grow Toyota has some of the best benefits I have ever seen at a company. The lease car alone is a huge plus and managers and above get a stipend for a lease car. This essentially allows for a free car for managers and above. I have the most expensive medical plan and it costs me roughly $75 a month. I am single with no dependents. Retirement plan is pretty decent. Not the best but still good. The people at Toyota truly do care about the company. They want to see it succeed.  Management have an loyalty to the company that I have not seen anywhere else.  Mostly this works out for good.  What Toyota is doing as a whole company is pretty inspiring . When you see Akio talking about mobility it is exciting. The company as a whole is doing some very interesting things with mobility and connected world.Toyota does amazing things for the community. The partnerships they have with community and the sheer number of volunteer opportunities is the best I have ever seen from a company.  People inside Toyota care about making a difference in the community and it is built into the culture. Also the business partnering groups are diverse and give employees other opportunities to use their talents.Toyota is not a good place to be innovative. They talk about it all the time but everything is marred in red tape.  The bureaucracy and politics at Toyota are the absolute worst I have ever seen. I work in the IT department and in order to get a basic server it takes at least 4 approvals and then about a 2 weeks to work itself through the system. The discussions of SCRUM and Agile are all talk. They have just changed the names and do the same type of workflow. The largest complaint is that team members are unable to properly do their jobs because all of the IT operations are outsourced to a third party company. Toyota is extremely, extremely siloed. If you are a technical person who wants to be hands on then I would highly recommend not applying at Toyota. Team member positions are mostly glorified project managers. You will just be managing projects and give requirements to other teams to do the job that more than likely you can do yourself but cannot do because they will not give you access."

Working level folks have been actively bridging the TEMA/TMS silos and trying to work together after the relocation.Management can suck the life out of entire workgroups. 1 or 2 people complaining out of 20 is one thing. 1718 out of 20 complaining about the same specific traits is a pattern. Bureaucracy for spending money, issuing documents, or organizing meetings can be incredibly high. Being mindful of company money when traveling (20%30% of the time, 812x/yr domestic/international for a total of $20k$30k spend) but getting denied $300 worth of tools because a manager is obsessed about all of their specific budget categories (while being under budget by ~50%!) is a very demotivating experience. Management has remained fairly siloed between TEMA/TMS. They're working to bridge it, so, mostly a complaint about the current status vs working level."

2018-09-23,3.0,"Big Name Company, Little People Mentality Larger than life brand/company, lots of career options.Headquarters campus is very nice, good food options.Quality and reliable products.Good pay and benefits.Everything is talk, no action.Favoritism. If Management doesn't like you, you get stuck in your position.No internal movement.Traditional organization, we talked about being innovative and being the best but we were very behind other brands technology wise. Also the technology we offer is very subpar compared to the rest of the industry which is disappointing considering how much people love Toyota/Lexus.HR as usual does not protect the employees, they allow unfair treatment by management. However, this is the complete opposite of what they tell you when you come to the company. HR is worthless and will not protect you.Culture (Respect for People) is not truly reflected across all departments.Your experience with Toyota depends on what department you are in which makes them inconsistent.They tell you they care about your feedback but when  you give it, you become a target.They will tell you they aren't but are TYPICAL CORPORATE AMERICA!!!!Managers do whatever they want without regard to their teams. ""Policy"" changes often so process are inconsistently followed.No development from management.Management is under qualified and clueless on their jobs which is why the departments have no consistency.Ridiculous and unrealistic metrics.You are treated like a preschooler and not an adult.No accountability for unfair treatment."

2018-10-17,5.0,"Consultant Review I’ve found the work at Toyota to be challenging yet fun for the most part. The benefits are also great, company matches up to 4% in 401k (you have to contribute 6% for this match). For those joining in the last few years that don’t get the pension are able to take advantage of an additional 5% company contribution towards 401k, even if you do not contribute. The campus is huge and there is a large gym with clean facilities. Overall the company has a soul and cares about its employees and customers deeply.Cafeteria and campus cafes are pricy! Your manager matters. Some can be great mentors and give you lots of opportunities to learn and grow, others are more concerned with climbing the ladder rather than leading."

We have genuine pride in our products because we know they are high quality and we know we are leading the industry in so many fields. Our customer service really tries to always do best by our customers. We have beautiful new headquarters.It is located in Plano, Texas. At least DFW is nearby and offers many flights to other places with better weather and activities. They are cutting budgets all the time and we are required to do more with much less. Temp help has all been but eliminated in some areas. Benefits are also at risk. Rather than embracing work trends such as remote work days or 9/80 work schedules, Toyota is reverting to oldschool work styles. The open floor plan is too open  noise level is high. It is also very difficult to recruit welleducated, wellrounded local talent and more difficult to convince top talent to move to Texas."

But that is also one of the best parts of the job. You are tasked with some things that are above your pay grade in order to show your managers what you are made of. Which is why I would say that is also the most enjoyable part of the job."

2018-11-10,1.0,"Not The Best Place For Women #MeToo Prestigious company, good pay, good on resume, diversity, jobs around the countryI interned on a marketing team full of men. There was a lot of stuff going on but the manager ignored me most of the time I was there and the nasty consultant I was forced to work with looked at my chest every time he talked to me. I was uncomfortable and told my manager and all that happened afterwards was they kept making me work with the same jerk. He told me I was stupid when I asked for help and did not help me anymore. This was soooo toxic and I could never fully feel comfortable or good at work. It wasnt the best experience so to all the ladies out there, look for a place where you will be treated with dignity and respect because they have to be out there!!!!! And for all the men who are reading this you need to take a stand against demeaning women and fight it because otherwise you encourage it!!!! Don't work for Toyota #MeToo"

Everyone I worked with was extremely dedicated and would strive to achieve goals, admittedly at personal expense(poor worklife balance).  Work was interesting and challenging.  I traveled to California, Japan, and Arizona on test trips.  Given your willingness to put in the overtime, you can have a rewarding career there if you find ways to balance the overtime/stress you will endure while working there.There is too much work to go around.  Frequent meetings and reports are the Japanese way, and it quickly becomes burdensome.  Work is often shared  by the team and the team generally puts in a lot of overtime.  It is a high stress job, especially if you don't have sufficient ""outlets"" in your personal life."

It didn't happen often, but when it did It would ruin someone elses day/week and I did not like doing that to people. Ultimately I would have left that job at some point, due to the terrible attitude of the people I worked closely with. They were disrespectful, impatient, more concerned with leaving work than doing a good job."

If you decide to stay at Toyota, there are lots opportunities (you just have to wait for them to open up, which is why network, etc. is so crucial) to learn new things and move around to different groupsIf you're willing to work hard and take on new challenges (which is sometimes volunteering for new projects) you can gain some great exposure to leaders in the organization and grow your careerOpportunities for contingent/contractors to convert to FTE, if desired (I did it)There are a lot of layers of management, so decisions can often take much longer than neededDue to the long tenure of employees, it can take time to move up and around the companyToyota isn't going to pay you the most base salary of any company out there, so if that's what you're looking for this likely isn't the place for youThe organization is constantly changing and moving, so if this is a problem for you, then you will not like it here (this is actually a good thing  but can be tough on some people)Changing course/ new ways of doing things can often be a difficult process"

It has trickled down from Japan that securing FullTime employees are not in the business strategy. Temporary employees moving forward. Basically, no additional headcount, but will replace attrition. More work, more stress for employees. Temporary employees that cannot secure permanent jobs, wind up leaving for other opportunities. Losing great, trained, and valuable 'assets'. TFS doesn't care. Japan for that matter. 2. The vehicle program has declined in attractiveness compared to those of other auto manufactures. Cost is high, penalties more stringent, they just don't care. 3. Department managers can be catty with each other, and power hungry. One 'male' manager in the admin department has no place being in his position. 4. Constant changes in processes.5. New supervisors promoted know nothing about the business. They let the good ones go.6. HR is not the place to go with concerns. They basically support management, and then you are placed on their 'watch' list. 7. Employees are afraid to say anything for fear of being labeled a troublemaker. 8. Japan and/or Plano Corporate Office do not seem to expand opportunities in the field offices. Processes are moving to the New, Modern Corporate office in Plano. 9. A fortunes was spend on the New, Modern, Corporate office, that disbursing decent raises, bonuses, and any needed modernization of field office are frozen.

2019-03-12,3.0,"No Leadership - Lots of Meetings Working with a small team on the TFS side of Toyota was very challenging.  Leadership was not well defined on any level.  Before I left the company, they were introducing scrum meetings and agile. Toyota has never had any kind of management system before.

2019-03-12,5.0,"A company invested in its people and its future as a mobility company Good pay, GREAT benefits program,  great job security they really stand behind their core value of respect for people, and ultimately they just treat their employees really well.  They have so many opportunities for their employees to grow within the company whether that's volunteering with Toyota4Good activities,  joining a BPG and getting involved that way, attending the many events held for team members onsite (like the recent Toyota Team USA Day), or participating in things like the innovation fair or the newest competition, ""The Tank"".  There's no end to the opportunities here and as long as you take advantage of them, you will be able to grow in your career here and meet new people and find a home in Toyota.It's a large company, so you do have some of the bureaucratic red tape that can come with that, and slower decision making at times.  Their benefits for maternity leave & paternity leave could be improved as well as we see other companies really setting the bar in this space I think they recognize this but hoping to see this improve in the coming years."

We have a coding which is called Q and A which needs a total overhaul. It is up to their discretion, not if it is correct. You will never know why you are getting the bad scores. That is never made clear at all. Oh and if you work the late shift you better get to work at least 1 1/2 hour early or you will not be able to locate a parking space."

Advancement is more about who you know and associate with.  I guess that is the way of business now days.  More work with less people also now days.  When I first started with the company I wondered where all of the older people were.  As your years with the company grow and you get older you will realize age can contribute to your sooner than later time frame with the company.

2019-03-29,5.0,"Good Large Corporation You're able to move to other divisions easily and qualifications tend to be fluid (I.E you can get IT experience without having a degree and move to IT pillar eventually).Business Partnering Groups are great for networking with executives and other team members and allow an outlet to grow leadership skills. There are divisions that are still true to TPS/Toyota Way and practice it to the best of their abilities Any concerns regarding HR is quickly addressedSenior Executives are very open and make themselves readily available (they place themselves across campus in open collaboration areas to allow people to bounce ideas off)Direction of the company was once bumpy but you can see they are addressing many of the issues with strategic initiatives. Most divisions have a morale committee and team building   a general investment in wanting to make sure employees are happy Encourages you to challenge those around you and solve problems in your daily work. Innovation/Tech fairs to bring out ad hoc projects that team members are working on that could benefit the company as a whole. Work/life balance is amazing  you can flex your time and work from home. Benefits are great! Paid volunteer time and heavy community emphasis.Like all companies, we still have things to work on: Need to go back to the original intent of the founders  lowest level employees are the most important, I see that has gotten away where middle management is where the investment/opportunities are.Investments on campus are done primarily on flash and not training (Balloon Arch vs. Agile SCRUM training, most people would rather have the training) but are often told it's not in the budget or you can't be ""lent"" for more than 1 hour by management. Like most companies  your Manager can make or break your career at TMNA unfortunately .You're far from the final product  the closest plant is 5 hours away. General lack of understanding of incoming professionals (Millennial's and Gen Z) and there's really no push to understand it seems either. In a generation that believes in quick movements for a successful career, TMNA isn't adapting.  Respect means different things to different generations and that's largely getting ignored as well. It seems that we are more reactive than proactive in this arena. Still a pay gap between men and women Large gap between TMC and TMNAStill no paternity leave.

The hardest part of the job is trying to work on multiple sold cars all due at the same or similar times."
2019-04-01,2.0,Toyota Loved what I was doing and the people that I worked next to.  The management is made up of family.  They seem to stay together even if one is wrong.  Makes it hard to talk with someone when you have a problem
2019-04-01,5.0,"GREAT place to work with amazing benefits! The new campus is fantastic and the employee benefits are great. Toyota is a global brand and I'm proud to work for a company that values their employees and gives back to the community. There are multiple opportunities to rotate within the company and learn different areas.Depending on the role/team, you might not have as much ownership since a lot of the work is outsourced. It all depends though."

2019-04-17,1.0,"Worst Job of my Life!!!!! Lies,lies, lies! Pay $$$People are impressed when you tell them you work for Toyota.They will pay your insurance if you lease a car.Where do I begin first of all let's start with the lies on the job description it didn't say anything about escalations but trust me you will be the catchall for every department.Training had an amazing instructor but they don't teach you how to deescalate customers they only teach you how to operate the systems.Once you get to the floor you will have a supervisor that you most likely hate there is only one supervisor who does his job properly all of the rest hide from their employees so they don't have to take sup escalations. Most of the supervisors are also very degrading because they will change your decision if a customer is screaming at them enough. They will lie to you in the beginning and say that you will only have to be there for a year before you're eligible for promotions but in actuality most people don't leave the department unless they've been there for 20 years or have a master's degree.Under no circumstances are you allowed to disconnect the call even if you are being belittled cursed out or insulted.If you are able to find a supervisor they will instruct you to place the customer on hold and wait until the customer just hangs up.The computers are very old like Windows 7 old and even though my computer was rebooting it took a month to get a replacement.Your schedule changes every 4 weeks yet they want you to preplan a doctor's appointment and things of that nature well ahead of time.You also are expected to request your vacation at the beginning of the year if not good luck getting it approved.The food in the kitchen is very expensive but very bland. The parking lot on the Southeast side is literally impossible and you will often be late for work just because you can't find a parking spot.If you are a woman you will be approached by someone eventually about your attire whether it be something as small as a head wrap or open toed shoes. They even sent someone home for wearing ugg boots!! Ridiculous.Overall just a very uptight corporate environment. If you are someone who values their respect and dignity this is not the job for you if you are someone who will literally do anything for money and are okay with being treated any type of way for money then you go right ahead."

Promotions in position are impossible, and raises are incredibly difficult to get without working lots of overtime to give the impression of ""Going above and beyond""Technician role is very siloed, as opposed to engineering role where you can rotate between departments. Many advantages given to engineers simply aren't there for technicians, but technicians are expected to make up for the lack of experience in engineers.Management is similarly inexperienced and put into position simply by the appearance of leadership capability, not actual ability. I have actually heard my manager say to me ""If you need technical help, you'll have to find it yourself, I don't know how."" This goes very against the training you receive initially of ""stop, call and wait"" if you need help. To make things more difficult, especially in the weld area, Toyota uses proprietary equipment and software, so you can't just Google it or call a supplier. If management or engineering can't help, you simply have to figure it out on your own. If the only help to be had is in another department, it is almost impossible to get. There are no resources to help with that."

2019-07-12,1.0,"Agile Practitioners Stay Away! There are some really great agile people there. Unfortunately they aren’t able to do their jobs well due to the environment.Toyota does not practice agile, scrum or kanban or anything else lean or agile. Teams work waterfall in an agile environment. People are put in positions that don’t have the skill set for the role. Leadership has not bought into agile and no one is driving the transformation so there are no consequences for refusing to change. Their agile practice group does not coach leadership, scrum masters, product owners or anyone else. They spend time trying to justify their existence by creating PowerPoints and training modules.It’s not uncommon for the manager of the scrum team to be the Product Owner. Sometimes the PO is also a developer. Both of these situations cause conflict of interest and team dysfunction. Leadership does not try to remove organizational impediments. People have become complacent and just go with the status quo instead of trying to promote change and agility thinking.The company is deep rooted in project management type thinking. They don’t want scrum masters but project managers who know a little bit about scrum or have been SM certified. They track enormous amounts of data to generate reports to track progress instead of focusing on business value. They generate multiple roadmaps only to map them back to a project plan with specific dates. Leadership is command and control and trusts no one."

However balancing a night shift job which starts at 715 but you need to make sure you are ON TIME so you need to leave around 530 which leaves no time for your family except on Sunday because youll sleep mostly all day on Saturday. I do like it...itll just be better for a single person with no kids or single person with older kidssleep.

2019-07-18,4.0,I like it. Just hard to balance kids and work I really enjoy the work....it is hard at first but once you catch on its easy. I like that you get a break every 2 hours. They really care about you catching on. Co workers are really nice. The over time pay is nice. However balancing a night shift job which starts at 715 but you need to make sure you are ON TIME so you need to leave around 530 which leaves no time for your family except on Sunday because youll sleep mostly all day on Saturday. I do like it...itll just be better for a single person with no kids or single person with older kidssleep.

2019-08-20,2.0,"Unfortumately the mind set in the automotive retail industry is the very thing that will eventually lead to it's failure. Management is bad and the turnover is high, let’s get that out first. They are constantly going through managers. They work on a roll it out and deal with the consequences later. You are constantly thrown through loops, system not working, manager doesn’t know what your doing because they never worked your job, something breaking etc. You’re always micro managed. You’ll feel like you’re not doing enough because they put you up against other people to calculate your production. It does have its perks, pay is great, benefits are amazing, coworkers are what really make it enjoyable. They also encourage you to take on another role and cross train, but don’t pay you any more than what you already make. You’ll be doing someone else’s job on another floor who makes more than you, but you’re still stuck with the normal pay you started with. Get ready to do work that is not in your job description. They also push that you can move up in the company, which is only slightly true. You can move side to side, but rarely do you see a floor employee moved up to a higher position. It’s more higher positions moving to another position on the same level. They also hire more than needed, and then work is scarce. You’ll be angry at what you see, complain and have nothing done about it. They are also asking about boosting moral, but they won’t budge on what really brings down moral... the constant tracking of production against team members. I could go on, but in a gist it’s a good first job and you’ll make it just don’t expect much."

2019-08-23,4.0,"Overall Great Place to Work Overall Toyota is a great place to work. The company truly cares about the employees and wants to make the company a better place to work. The pay is good, benefits are fantastic, and coworkers are mostly great. It is mostly younger engineers at the R&D locations and that contributes to a relaxed work environment. I had 3 different managers in my tenure at Toyota and I liked all of them on a personal and professional level. Most employees and lower level management will help out anyone in need. Some interesting projects and career growth opportunities.1) The biggest negative to working at Toyota is the work life balance. This is dependent on department and role but overall if you are an engineer (especially in design), you will be working long hours. In many cases lower level managers are also working large amounts of overtime. There's too much work to go around. This creates a very negative atmosphere during projects and the feeling that there is never enough time to do a good job. The high workload is cyclical in nature so it's not constant but it does take a toll on personal life. 2) For younger engineers or engineers with little experience, there should be a mentormentee relationship. This would get rid of much of the waste that happens when someone new doesn't know how to complete certain tasks. There needs to be more direction given and expectations laid out."

The issue that became apparent within a few weeks was the blatant favoritism. Often I would be neck deep in work only to look up and see that all my coworkers were nowhere to be found. More often than not they would take unlimited smoke breaks and have no consideration to the other coworkers who don't smoke and would face more work alone. The issue became more prevalent when management would clearly look the other way when some employees made mistakes or were not doing anything productive. All the while when I would make a mistake or take too long on a job I was often brought into the service manager's office and yelled at. My job was constantly being threatened and later on the service manager decided we were now janitors who had to clean the filthy break and bathrooms. I refused and so did some of my coworkers, which in turn earned us a greater negative bias with management. It truly wasn't a bad job and I honestly enjoyed some of the labors and learning opportunities, but sadly that was vastly overshadowed by problematic coworkers and one of the most immature and unprofessional service managers I've ever seen."

The overall company has a strong promotion-from-within culture, but expect to be on night shift in order to move up the ladder.

The culture is very toxic, many of my co-workers were very unhappy and most of the direct management seemed to not have interest in changing that. Being a manufacturing plant, the work is fast-paced, and is solely focused on ""keep the line running"". Safety and quality is secondary to achieve a consistent operational rate of approx. 94 to 96%. Many of my co-workers who had only been there a few years underwent some sort of corrective surgery due to the work they were doing. I would not suggest working at this facility unless your in any other department.

2019-09-24,1.0,"Quality Trainee Program= Total Bust 1. There is a lot of prestige working for a company such as Toyota. It's a great resume builder. But a simple intern should suffice. 2.  Toyota does offer great benefits. But I will prefice this that the other offers that I received out of college were higher than Toyota. I turned down a higher paying salary for preceved opportunity.  3. Their work is challenging and rewarding.1. I was hired as an Automotive Technical Trainee out of college. I worked hard for two years and interviewed for multiple jobs within my department. Unfortunately, I was passed up multiple times, but was assured by management that I would be retained for more rotations as a trainee. I patiently waited (with other automotive trainees) to be placed into a quality or service support role. After two years of hard work, and relocating to Texas, and training for a position within PQ&SS I was notified by email (not in person) that I needed to find my next opportunity elsewhere. Two years of my life I will never get back. 2. The pay structure at Toyota is hourly. In most rotations I was paid for the work that I did. However, in my last rotation as a Trainee I was denied overtime, however the expectation was a full workload. I worked many hours of overtime without being compensated. This is money that I will never see. Don't expect their hourly pay structure to be evenly distributed. 3. The quality trainee program within Toyota is a total disaster. The management within PQ&SS does not promote within. This program no longer works as a method of attaining a legitimate job within the quality ranks. Management also never addressed us personally, and actually lied to questions that trainees had regarding the state of affairs. We were lead to believe there were legitimate opportunities. When stuff really hit the fan  no one was accountable  and I was addressed by a lousy email. 4. If you are considering the quality trainee program or PQ&SS in general I would strongly urge you to reconsider. There are much better opportunities out there."

2019-10-03,3.0,"Mobility company or not, our primary focus continues to be cars. I have confidence that I have job security. Unlike domesticbased automakers which hire & layoff their employees in droves, Toyota North America is very stable. However, this also translates to very limited movement, hiring into the company was very difficult even within a trainee program. My manager & senior manager give constructive feedback privately and also recognize my efforts. I feel comfortable to challenge the status quo and offer suggestions to solve problems in new ways.The Plano campus has nice amenities which positively impacts my work input/output.The 401(k) match is okay.Having 'Toyota' on your resume will get you a job almost anywhere else.Corporate Communications strategically blasts Diversity & Inclusion videos when it's time to take your annual harassment training. The company's Diversity & Inclusion efforts are more like forced unconscious bias retraining than actually including people for their diversity.The benefits are marginal compared to the cost of living in my area. HR is resting on the laurels of the benefits offered by the nowdefunct Toyota Motor Sales organization. Cost of living in north Dallas has risen substantially since Toyota completed their campus here, HR needs to reevaluate their offered base salaries to the north Dallas area. I don't expect to drive a new Toyota or eat out regularly, and it's difficult to keep my head above water being a somewhat recent college graduate.Employee discount on Toyota vehicles is a joke, I can negotiate a better deal on a dealer lot as a regular customer on a Toyota vehicle. Toyota has continued to slip against the competition in JD Power on vehicle telematics; yet our Connected Technologies department continues to be understaffed & we're one of the last automakers to add Apple Carplay to our product line.  If you have an Automotive Degree, look for another company. Quality managers from old TEMA groups continue to pick candidates with Engineering Technology degrees that do not have practical automotive knowledge."

2020-03-23,3.0,Positive attitudes and culture among co-workers for the most part I recently left Toyota after a brief tenure at their Cambridge facility. They did not offer to relocate me to another position more suited to my ability once I had given my 2 weeks notice from the assembly line.  I would have been more than willing to stay on at Toyota if the pay scale was better and  that not having union protection gives them a stronghold on their employees. The current Corona Virus situation has opened my eyes even more on their lack of care for employee's well being and that profits are more important since they decided to stay open even after the other auto manufacturers decided that it would be best to shutdown operations.  Not sure if this is the Japanese way or if the Americanization of many employers in Canada has taken hold at Toyota.

They used me for all of my experience and knowledge. Customer surveys dictate you future. They are a pass or fail based survey so even one star less then a 5 will mess up your growth. They have really dumb survey criteria's like facility and waiting area. So if someone gets cold coffee/cookie or runs out of TP in the bathroom, that effects the advisor for some reason. How is that the advisors fault? False promises the whole time of things like new software or better pay. If you make the dealership a lot of money, you barely make any of it for yourself."

Great products and they respect the customer.During and shortly after it moved to Texas, Toyota lost a vast majority of its quality leaders and large numbers of talented employees chose not to move.. Employees became a ""commodity"" and the culture that made the place great was lost with so many new people. So much historical knowledge and competencies were lost as hundreds and hundreds of new people were trying to establish themselves and navigate their new jobs. Benefits were cut significantly, but somehow, people at the top still act as though Toyota offers so much to its employees. But benefits are better at a lot of other Fortune 500s.

Rampant favoritism, best strategy is to link up with a powerful mentor. If you're an outspoken conservative this is not a good place for you. If social issues isn't your thing you'll likely feel you don't belong there as there all constant social justice messages all week long.

Benefits continue to be pared away every year. Most managers sit in meetings all day long.

Toyota/Lexus looks great on a resume.As an agency employee that spends majority of my time at the corporate office (preCovid), I think I have a pretty strong perspective.It's extremely hard to move up. People stay in the same roles for 520+ years. You will likely not move up unless someone leaves and unfortunately, people stay in their roles for their entire career, doing the bare minimum but Toyota isn't the type of company to fire people so they know that they're safe and can just ride the wave. It will take you YEARS and YEARS to get a promotion, no matter how hard you work. Yes, there are raises every once in a while (maybe between every1218 months), but who wants to keep doing the same exact work in the same position for 6+ years, raise or not?Japanese culture doesn't have the best worklife balance and everything is always a fire drill. Agencies and contractors need to pump out report after report. They truly treat us like slaves. 1day reports, 3day reports, 10day reports, 15day reports, 30day report. And rarely a thank you or ""I appreciate your hard work."" I'm pretty sure they don't even read them! Just unnecessary work at all times for no rewards. Because of the semitoxic culture, every single corporate employee that I work with seems to have a bit (or a lot) of anxiety. They're always nervous, always rushing, unnecessarily demanding, never having a backbone towards other teams or anyone more senior, always on edge, always kissing a** with other departments. They also very rarely take PTO (awful PTO plan) but it's clear that they all need a break. Also, because a lot of the business works with agencies and contractors, I've found that many of the corporate employees aren't very skilled  they just work as middlemen or babysitters between agencies and contractors and other internal departments. This can be frustrating to have lowerlevel corporate employees trying to approve agency/contractor work but lack experience to do so. They also don't have the best respect, trust, or outlook towards agencies/contractors and treat us as such. We're the ones doing all the work, bending over backward to please you, only for you to get all the credit without even saying thanks! Give us the respect that we deserve! You're no better than us because you work for corporate. Most of us have much stronger work experience than you do and trust us, we don't want in that environment, always being stressed and anxious to the max. Agency / contractor life and culture is ions better."

2021-05-30,3.0,"IT division (aka IDS) desperately needs to clean house, but the company overall is good place to work Large company so there's broad range of growth opportunities. It isn't cutthroat. Some of the topdown principles that stem from home office in Japan are impressive  for example, in times of trouble, layoffs of fulltime employees are the absolute last measure considered, rather than the first.IT division in sorry state of affairs. Attempting to transition to Agile, but upper mgt has not adapted, and shows no signs of getting there. The CIO's messaging is that the Agile transition is completed and a success (he’s advertised as much on externally in places like LinkedIn) with ""new, innovative approaches such as having 2 Product Owners for each scrum team, and defining a BSA/QA hybrid role within each scrum development team."" But this is fooling nobody; everyone inside and outside the company knows these things are antithetical to Agile and represent a failure to adopt properly.In fact, CIO relationship with his division is limited to propaganda. For example, there have been at least two failures of massive IT initiatives in the past few years, and there has been no acknowledgement of the failure, let alone communication on how it happened and what upper mgt will do to prevent in future. The CIO hosts 'Town Hall' sessions that do not meet any definition of a Town Hall. i.e. most of it is scripted, and the limited Q&A that is not scripted will only allow questions submitted through instant message, which are screened so no controversial or substantive questions get answered or even shown.Most concerning is that the past 12 months has seen enormous reduction in IT contractor staff, while simultaneously increasing the number and complexity of initiatives. The division has nearly been cut in half. The rationale seems to have been that converting 2 contractor headcount to 1 fulltime headcount will more than double productivity. Needless to say, that has not happened. Combine all of this with attempts to prioritize work in Waterfall fashion, poorly and whilst spinning about any time someone says “squirrel” – the conclusion is upper mgt has everyone’s ends frayed."

Seems like the higher up you go in people you deal with, the poorer you'll be treated. The Senior Managers I experienced are unorganized, don't understand their business areas, and are otherwise incompetent. But because they work for Toyota they thing they are the best there is.Promotions appear to have been made on groupthink than competency.  It's a country club. Bad leaders surround themselves with more bad leaders because it's what they know.Decisions are made slowly and to personal whims instead of what's best for the company. It's not an efficient environment to work in at all. Plano is not the same as the Toyota manufacturing excellence you hear about.If during the work you're trying to accomplish you go against the gain, retribution is a definitely an outcome."

This place is far from professional, even though the people try to make it out to be. You don’t get any lunch breaks!! If you do eat you have to swallow it whole.Forbid if you get a deal and you trying to eat. You will not eat!!! Deals are push and not put together correctly. Missing key items to help the process move smoothly and the the same time you are getting hammer/ pressure to hurry up,. The sales team is very unprofessional!! Very rude and belittling. No smiles, but Constant badgering. No one on the sales team, mind you, that has been there for 15+ know to operate finance, but will rush you to hurry up so the customer can come back to your office. The upper management are very short and rude with you.The hours are terrible/ridiculous!! They close at 10:00, but will try to close a deal if they walk in 30 mins to 15 til. It take at least an hour to talk to the customer out front to see where they interest might be. By the time a deal is done it’s already 11/12. No family life. Kiss that goodbye. The sales team are only out for their self. I never in my life seen a place so unprofessional, disorganized and rude/ uncaring in my life!!! It’s not worth your sanity.No smiles and no one you can approach with a concern. This !!! 8-10 are insane hour to work 7 days a week. You ask a question from upper management and it seems like they ALWAYS want to be belligerent. "

For example after a covid outbreak..certain employees were not made aware(including myself). No PPP offered and mask mandates are not properly followed."

I will NEVER EVER give this dealership any of my hard earned money & would warn people to STAY AWAY !

2021-10-17,3.0,All about the money Toyota is one of the wealthiest companies in the world. They do this by having an eight year grow in to achieve top pay. Over the last 15 years my insurance has skyrocketed; pay doesn’t keep up with inflation. Turnover is absurd! When a company of Toyotas stature pays recruiting bonuses there is a problem. It’s all about the numbers. You never know when you will leave. I advise to look elsewhere; much easier jobs for similar money

2021-10-21,3.0,Unorganized environment  The salary is low and you will be working on a comission structure. Upper management can't make a decision and will always be changing rules. They will make you feel like trash if you're not going in to work extra time on your days off. The owner will tow employee's vehicles if they are not parked all the way to the back of the lot (very dangerous for those who work night shifts because the parking lot is pretty dark)

2021-10-24,1.0,"Repetitive manual labor that will break your body down Toyota on the outside, loves the community. Their name pops up and their logo is everywhere. They give thousands to the community. Paid Millions to have the Trash Pandas stadium named Toyota stadium. But the bonuses that are part of your yearly wages have gotten smaller and smaller each year. It’s so small, it’s sad. You will NEVER get used to the 2 week swing shift schedule. It will take years off your life and you will HALF of your families lives. Promotions are easy. All you have to do is put your time in and pass a test on computer. That person is promoted even if they’re not qualified. Even if they can’t run as many stations as a regular team member. People love the title but have no place in a leadership role. That goes for Team Leads, Group Leads and AM’s. Quality issues are examined and studied and parts are put on hold. But somehow always get released and approved even if they don’t meet criteria. Quality over quantity does not exist. Upper management makes poor decisions when it comes to the safety of all team members when weather conditions are bad. Your sick time is part of your PTO. They are so short handed because so many team members are out on medical leave. So apparently that’s easy to get approved as well. People are gone for months at a time or 2-3 days a week. While lines are left short handed and management pulls team members from other lines to get that number. You may only get 5 mins of training. Yet, another quality issue! Be careful when choosing to work for a company of this size. Your eyes will be opened."

If you ever had to call out sick or ask for vacation time it was always frowned upon. Even if by some miracle you got approved they would make you feel almost guilty. If you work hard and above and beyond expectation, they don't appreciate it. The only thing that made working here tolerable was the outgoing salespeople."

2021-11-13,1.0,Bonus program  Upper level management is very political.   Toyota culture under American leadership has declined to the point of ineffectiveness.
